The United Nations said Tuesday that Israel had denied it access to the Rafah crossing, the key entry point for aid into the besieged territory.\n\nThe White House said the closing of Rafah and the other main crossing, Karem Shalom, was \"unacceptable\" and needed to be reversed.\n\nIn addition to seeking to establish a maritime corridor for aid shipments, the United States has also been delivering assistance by air.\n\nCENTCOM said American C-130 cargo planes dropped more than 25,000 Meal Ready To Eat military rations into Gaza on Tuesday in a joint operation that also delivered the

The US said on Tuesday that it was assured by Israel that Kerem Shalom would be reopened on Wednesday.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing Tuesday that \"no one should think that the completion of this pier and the opening of that route is in any way a replacement for Kerem Shalom and Rafah being open.\"\n\n\"Getting that pier finished is not a sufficient means to close other gates.

Last week, the floating pier section was completed.\n\nSingh said the Trident pier \"is the component that eventually will be anchored to the Gaza shore.\"\n\nConstruction of the pier began late last month as pressure mounted for more humanitarian aid to be delivered to Palestinian civilians caught up in Israel's war against Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists in Gaza.\n\nSoldiers from the Army's 7th Transportation Brigade at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, and sailors from Naval Beach Group 1 at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California have been involved in construction and deployment of the pier, the Pentagon said in a news release. About 1,000 soldiers and sailors are involved in the operation.\n\nSingh said sea conditions, which prompted a pause in construction Friday by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), are not conducive yet to connect the pier to the mainland.\n\n\"Today, there are forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved,\" Singh said. \"So, the pier sections and military vessels involved in its construction are still positioned at the Port of Ashdod\" in northern Gaza.\n\nSingh said as CENTCOM stands by to move the pier in position, humanitarian aid will be loaded onto the MV Sagamore cargo ship, which is anchored in Cyprus.\n\n\"The Sagamore will use the JLOTS system and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world,\" Singh said. \"Aid delivered to the floating pier will then be transloaded onto U.S. military logistic support vessels and subsequently transported to the Trident pier, or the causeway, where it will be loaded onto trucks for onward delivery and distribution by humanitarian assistance NGOs.\"\n\nUntil the pier is in place, the Pentagon said it will continue humanitarian assistance via airdrops into Gaza. On Sunday, two U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft dropped more than 25,000 ready-to-eat meals into northern Gaza.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter

The World Health Organization has warned some 2.3 million Gazans face extreme hunger that could become a full-blown famine by next month as Israel continues its war against Hamas militants who launched a surprise assault in October from the enclave.\n\nPresident Joe Biden first announced the JLOTS operation on March 7 during his State of the Union speech. One day later, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesman, said the temporary pier would be operational within about 60 days.\n\nU.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said Friday in a post on X that construction on the pier was paused Thursday due to \"sea state considerations.\" Construction of the pier moved to the Port of Ashod, one of Israel's three main cargo ports north of Gaza.\n\nSingh said the pier sections and military vessels involved in the construction are still positioned at the Port of Ashod. In the meantime, the U.S. is loading aid on the ship, MV Sagamore, currently in Cyprus.\n\n\"The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as [U.S. Agency for International Development] and other partners collect aid from around the world,\" she said.\n\nSingh said defense officials hope to have the pier in position later this week.\n\nAbout 1,000 American troops are involved in the operation of the pier, which costs about $320 million.\n\nThe Pentagon has stressed no U.S. troops will be on the ground in Gaza, but some lawmakers have raised concerns about the involvement of American troops in Israel's campaign in Gaza and risks to their safety.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, blasted the pier project last week and said troops working on its construction are within range of Hamas rockets. Following a mortar attack last month near the area where the pier will connect with the shore, Wicker called it \"unfortunate but predictable.\"\n\n\"This has been an ill-conceived mission from the start. President Biden should never have put our men and women in this position, and he should abandon this project immediately before any U.S. troops are injured,\" he said.\n\nThe Army in March sent four ships from the 7th Transportation Brigade at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., toward the Mediterranean Sea to spearhead the operation. The Navy deployed three ships to help in the construction of the pier. One of those ships, the USNS 2nd Lt. John P. Bobo was forced to return to the United States last month after it had an engine room fire.\n\nOnce the pier is operational, commercial ships carrying aid will sail from Cyprus to the floating dock, where the aid will then be moved to smaller Army boats that will travel to the causeway and on to aid groups. The new port is located southwest of Gaza City.\n\nAmerican troops will be housed and fed on ships near the floating pier. The British navy announced toward the end of April that a support ship, RFA Cardigan Bay, was sailing to provide accommodation for hundreds of U.S. sailors and soldiers working to establish the platform.\n\nThe U.S. military has said it will provide its own security for Army and Navy forces offshore, while Israel will take care of security on shore.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_adams@stripes.com", "name": "Matthew Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Singh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wicker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Wicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_2nd_Lt._John_P._Bobo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USNS 2nd Lt.

Thousands were killed, and dozens of thousands of others were injured in the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe latest statistics by the Ministry of Health in Gaza revealed that the death toll from Israeli brutal pounding on the Gaza Strip since October 7 has soared to 34,789+ people, with more than 78,204+ injuries.\n\nSince then, approximately 85% of Gazans have been displaced, all of whom are suffering from severe food insecurity, and the healthcare system has collapsed.

to be opened to aid deliveries, and that the US military would conduct more aid drops from planes.\n\n\"This is just meant to help augment, to help complement other ways that aid can get in,\" she said.\n\nPoor conditions at sea are preventing immediate placement and use of the pier, Ms Singh said.\n\n\"Today, there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe

from the Central Command of the US Army, the temporary pier in Gaza will enable the delivery of large quantities of humanitarian aid from ships to shore via trucks, with vehicles moving directly from the ships along the temporary pier to a sorting station on land.\n\nFurthermore, the maritime route between Cyprus and Gaza, known as the Amalthea plan, will facilitate the delivery of international humanitarian aid shipments by sea.\n\nThe latest humanitarian aid shipment from Cyprus to Gaza, aboard the ship the Jennifer, landed at the Israeli port of Ashdod on April 28.\n\nNews website Reuters reported that the jetty had cost a total of $320 million (\u20ac298m) to construct, and that around 1,000 US servicepeople had been involved in its construction, most of whom are from the US Army and the US Navy.\n\nThe jetty's potential placement has also been a cause for concern among some quarters, with British newspaper The Guardian having reported that the jetty's placement may be too far south to help alleviate the \"very high\" risk of famine in the northern part of Gaza.\n\nThe north of Gaza, including Gaza City, has been effectively cut off from the rest of the strip by a military road constructed by the Israeli Defence Force which connects Israel with Gaza's coast, known as the Netzarim corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli forces seized control of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and tanks pushed into the southern Gazan city of Rafah as international mediators struggled to find agreement on a ceasefire between Israel and its Hamas foe.", "source":

The Israel Defense Forces have reported taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, a main entry point for humanitarian aid.\n\nThe other main border crossing, Kerem Shalom, has come under rocket attacks by Hamas which continue daily. According to the latest statement from the UN's humanitarian office both crossings remain closed: \"The two main arteries for getting aid into Gaza are currently choked off,\" a UN spokesperson told Reuters: \"If no fuel comes in for a prolonged period of time it would be a very effective way of putting the humanitarian operation in its grave.\"\n\nSo now the main ways to get aid into Gaza have been shut down. This raises the pressure on US plans to complete its temporary pier off the coast of Gaza to receive aid. This is still some way off being operational.\n\nThere were hopes that the pier may be completed and become operational by the weekend of May 4-5. On May 1, the Pentagon announced that it was about 50% completed.\n\nBut due to rough seas, assembly had to be moved to the Israeli port of Ashdod, 40kms north of the Gaza Strip. The safety of the US soldiers involved in the pier's construction is also a concern.\n\nThe construction cost approximately US$320 million (\u00a3255 million). The 549-metre causeway, which has been named the Trident Pier, will consist of modular sections anchored to the shoreline. The US military is also building a floating platform, 82 metres long and 23 metres wide, about three miles off Gaza's coast.\n\nPallets of humanitarian aid undergo inspection before being loaded on to commercial ships in Cyprus. On the floating platform, pallets are transferred onto smaller boats for transport through shallow water to the causeway. Trucks transport pallets to a secure drop-off area for distribution by humanitarian agencies like the World Food Programme.\n\nThe vessel Sagamore is set to be the first to deliver aid to the pier. It is currently in Cyprus. The 184 metre long container ship has its own cranes to offload cargo and can transport up to 1728 20-foot containers.\n\nInitially, the pier will handle 90 truckloads of aid per day. Once fully operational, capacity is expected to increase to 150 truckloads per day. This would be a valuable addition to the average of 189 trucks that entered Gaza by road every day in April, but insufficient to meet humanitarian needs.\n\nHumanitarian aid providers are already staging cargo in Cyprus for delivery via the sea route. As with the existing land corridors for aid delivery from Egypt and Jordan, many tonnes of food, medical supplies, and other items are waiting to be transported to Gaza.\n\nThis conflict is highly political around the world. Any military intervention by the US would be very controversial. Officials emphasised that no US boots will be on the ground in Gaza as part of the construction and operation of the pier. However, armed forces will be part of this new aid corridor.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces are responsible for anchoring the causeway to the beach. They also stated that they will provide security and logistics support. The Royal Navy is supporting the US during the construction of the pier. The BBC reported that British troops might also drive trucks from the causeway to the distribution area. This would be a significant foreign intervention. There are concerns that UK soldiers would become targets .\n\nArmed forces can play an important role in humanitarian aid, especially with their logistics expertise. However, they are not considered humanitarian personnel and their role is seen very critically.\n\nHumanitarian organisations adhere to the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. Their aim is to address human suffering wherever it is found. According to the principle of neutrality, they should not take sides in a conflict. Impartiality means that aid should be provided regardless of nationality, race, religion, class or politics. These principles are difficult to maintain while working with armed forces.\n\nHumanitarian organisations do not have a consistent approach to working with the military. But when humanitarian action drifts away from these principles, the risks for humanitarian aid workers grow. More than 200 aid workers have already been killed in Gaza.\n\nThe most widely reported attack on aid workers was linked to the operations of the original smaller pier for aid deliveries by sea. Seven workers for the NGO World Central Kitchen were killed leaving a warehouse for goods being delivered to that pier. More recently, there was a mortar attack on the land side of the pier under construction.\n\nThe UN has announced a new mechanism for increasing aid to Gaza. In addition to the pier, this includes the temporary reopening of the Erez crossing in Gaza's north on May 1, which so far allowed 30 trucks with medical supplies from Jordan to pass.\n\nThe Erez crossing has been opened to allow up to 40 trucks per day into Northern Gaza. However, security scanning will still need to be done elsewhere, most likely towards the southern end of Gaza - at the moment still a combat zone.\n\nThe port of Ashdod handling aid shipments has finally been approved by Israel. This deep water port relatively close to Gaza can handle much higher volumes of cargo and faster processing than the floating pier. But that aid still needs to be able to cross into Gaza.\n\nWith Israeli officials doing checks in Cyprus before aid is shipped to Gaza, the pier avoids the bottleneck of border crossings. But the pier can only supplement and not replace aid deliveries by road - 90 to 150 truckloads of aid per day alone will not be enough to meet the needs of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe authors do

Now comes the operationally challenging part -- anchoring the pier and defending it as it begins operations. This challenge falls to the IDF, which has already been attacked while working in this area. Good job getting to this point, but there are a number of additional hurdles to clear.\" -- RADM (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, FDD Senior Fellow and Senior Director of FDD's Center on Cyber and Technology\n\nThe Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) system consists of two separate sections: a floating pier in the Mediterranean, several miles off the Gaza coast, which will receive aid offloaded from cargo ships. U.S. troops will transfer the aid onto trucks on smaller vessels operated by military personnel and transported to a causeway pier, called a Trident, anchored to the shore. The trucks, driven by World Food Programme workers, will then drive onto the pier and continue into Gaza to distribute the aid.\n\nSingh said that \"CENTCOM stands by to move the pier into position in the near future, adding that the Pentagon hopes to have the pier anchored by the end of the week. U.S. personnel and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are currently loading the U.S.-flagged cargo ship MV Sagamore with aid in a port in Cyprus. On April 29, Singh told reporters that the pier would cost $320 million to build -- significantly more than originally predicted, and could cost more if the operation lasts more than 90 days.\n\nIDF troops will install the Trident when it comes ashore, as the United States has consistently stated that there will be no U.S. military personnel on the ground in Gaza. On April 25, the IDF approved a deal to provide security and logistic support for the JLOTS initiative when it becomes operational.\n\nEarlier on April 25, Gazan terrorists attacked the construction site for the pier's marshaling area, causing minimal damage. During the attack, IDF troops had to rush UN officials touring the site to shelter. When the pier becomes operational, U.S. troops operating the vessels transferring aid to the Trident will briefly be within range of terrorist fire when approaching the causeway.\n\n\"Israel Readying

(US Central Command)\n\nBad weather conditions are preventing the anchoring of a U.S. military floating pier system that will facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to a starving Gazan population, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. military has completed the construction of the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) on the Mediterranean Sea, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said. The operation is part of an international effort to create a maritime corridor to supply aid to the Gaza strip via Cyprus.\n\n\"The U.S. military has completed the offshore construction of the Trident pier section, or 'the causeway,' which is the component that will eventually be anchored to the Gaza shore,\" Ms. Singh said. \"So as of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS -- the floating pier and the Trident pier -- are complete and awaiting final movement offshore.\"\n\nHowever, current weather conditions do not allow moving the floating piers in place.\n\n\"Today, there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved,\" Ms. Singh said.\n\nLast week, assembly of the piers had to be paused due to adverse sea conditions, and they were moved near the Port of Ashdod -- about 18 miles north of Gaza.\n\nIn the meantime, a U.S.-flagged cargo ship, the MV Sagamore, is being loaded with humanitarian aid supplies in Cyprus, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe Sagamore will travel to the floating pier once it is in place -- a few miles off the coast of Gaza. On the pier, the cargo will be unloaded onto trucks that are onboard Army-owned utility ships and logistic support vessels. When the ships arrive at the Trident pier, the trucks can drive off the ships directly into Gaza.\n\nThe Pentagon foresees an initial transit of about 90 truckloads of supplies per day to pass through the causeway. When the operation reaches full capacity, as many as 150 trucks will make their way into Gaza daily.\n\n\"We're going to start with an additional small amount of aid trucks to flow in to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase,\" Ms. Singh said.\n\nAfter more than six months of war, the aid won't come a minute too soon -- last week, a senior U.N. official said northern Gaza was experiencing \"full-blown famine.\" In March, the United Nations estimated the number of people experiencing \"catastrophic levels of hunger\" had already risen to 79 percent and is expected to rise to over 90 percent by July.\n\nThough the JLOTS will provide substantial relief to the war-torn area, it will not suffice to feed a population of 2.3 million people in distress. \"The best way [is] through those land routes, and we do want to see those opened up,\" Ms. Singh said.\n\nSince March 2, U.S. Central Command, in coordination with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, has carried out nearly 40 humanitarian missions to airdrop nearly 1,200 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, the Pentagon said.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com",

Ashdod.\"\n\nThe completion of JLOTS in the Mediterranean Sea comes as humanitarian conditions in Gaza grow worse by the day, with the United Nations and humanitarian organizations in the territory warning that the region has fallen into famine due to a severe lack of access to food and medical supplies.\n\nThe situation is expected to become more dire with Israel's Tuesday military seized the Rafah crossing, the sole entry point for humanitarian aid between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nDespite the pier not being in position, Singh said that the U.S. is loading aid onto the ship MV Sagamore, currently in Cyprus but meant to be the first vessel to transport the assistance from there to the pier.\n\n\"The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system, and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world,\" Singh noted.\n\nShe added that defense officials hope to have JLOTS in position \"later this

So as of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS -- the floating pier and the Trident pier -- are complete and awaiting final movement offshore.\"\n\nAt the same time, she said, the cargo ship MV Sagamore is at port in Cyprus being loaded with humanitarian aid supplies bound for Gaza.\n\n\"The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world,\" she said.\n\nSingh explained that the Sagamore, a commercial ship registered in the U.S., will be loaded with humanitarian aid in Cyprus and will then travel from Cyprus to a temporary floating pier several miles off the coast of Gaza. There, at sea, cargo will be unloaded from the Sagamore onto trucks that are onboard Army-owned landing craft utility ships, or LCUs, and logistic support vessels, or LSVs.\n\nThe Army ships will then travel toward Gaza where they will meet up with the Trident pier. There, the trucks onboard the LCUs and LSVs will drive onto the pier and onto the shore of Gaza where the humanitarian aid supplies can then be staged for delivery inside Gaza.\n\nIt's expected that initially about 90 truckloads of supplies will transit the causeway each day and make their way into Gaza. When the operation reaches full capacity, as many as 150 trucks will make their way into Gaza daily.\n\n\"I think what you're going to see at the very beginning is a 'crawl, walk, run' scenario,\" Singh said. \"We're going to start with an additional small amount of aid trucks to flow in to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase ... when we get to full operational capacity.\"\n\nWhile the JLOTS system may eventually deliver substantial capacity, Singh said it's neither the only way nor the best way to get much-needed supplies into Gaza.\n\n\"The best way [is] through those land routes, and we do want to see those opened up,\" she said. \"We do want to see aid continue to flow in through those land crossings. This is just one [way.] It's meant to help augment, to help complement, other ways that aid can get in.\"\n\nThe Gaza Strip, which is about 25 miles long, lies entirely inside Israel and shares a border to the south with Egypt. There are three locations along its border where humanitarian supplies could move into Gaza from either Egypt or Israel. Those locations include the Erez crossing in northern Gaza and the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza. Both of those crossings connect Gaza to Israel. The Rafah crossing is on the Gaza border with Egypt.\n\nSince March 2, U.S. Central Command, in coordination with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, has carried out nearly 40 humanitarian missions to airdrop nearly 1,200 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\n\nWhile the JLOTS construction is now complete, that capability has not yet been deployed due to weather conditions, Singh said. Right now, the two piers are floating on the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel near the Port of Ashdod -- about 18 miles north of Gaza. Weather conditions, Singh said, prevent moving either of them to their final location.\n\n\"Late last week, Centcom temporarily paused moving the floating pier and Trident pier toward the vicinity of Gaza due to sea state considerations,\" she said. \"Today there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved.\"",

She added that bad weather has prevented the U.S. military from doing so.\n\n\"Today there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved, so the pier sections and military vessels involved in its construction are still positioned at the Port of Ashdod\" in Israel, she said.\n\nThe completion of JLOTS in the Mediterranean Sea comes as humanitarian conditions in Gaza grow worse by the day, with the United Nations and humanitarian organizations in the territory warning that the region has fallen into famine due to a severe lack of access to food and medical supplies.\n\nThe situation is expected to become more dire with Israel's Tuesday military takeover of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, the sole entry point for humanitarian aid between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nDespite the pier not being in position, Singh said that the U.S. is loading aid onto the ship MV Sagamore, currently in Cyprus but meant to be the first vessel to transport the assistance from there to the pier.\n\n\"The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system, and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world,\" Singh noted.\n\nShe added that defense officials hope to have JLOTS in position \"later this week.\"", "source": {"uri":

The US Central Command cited adverse weather conditions as the reason for the pause, but no specific date has been provided for the resumption of work on the pier.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the purpose of the temporary pier has escalated significantly in recent days after an announcement by the White House that it is exploring avenues to facilitate the reception of Palestinian refugees from Gaza who have family connections in America for humanitarian reasons. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the administration is evaluating policy proposals aimed at supporting Palestinians who are relatives of American citizens. However, specific procedures are yet to be unveiled.\n\nMeanwhile, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin revealed that armed US forces will be stationed on the temporary pier as part of its operation, and they may engage in military confrontations if subjected to armed attacks in Gaza. Austin was at a congressional session addressing questions regarding the presence of American forces on the temporary pier and whether that could amount to \"boots on the ground\" in Gaza.\n\nThe construction of the temporary pier will come at a staggering cost of over $320 million, and there are lingering questions and controversies surrounding its management and security. During the hearing, Senator Roger Wicker expressed concerns over the hefty price tag borne by American taxpayers, particularly considering that the pier's operation is slated for a mere 90 days.\n\nAt the same time, the British government still will neither confirm nor deny the deployment of British forces on the ground in Gaza nor provide any specifics regarding a potential role for British forces in overseeing aid distribution there.\n\nAccording to the BBC, British troops are being considered for deployment on the ground in Gaza to facilitate aid delivery through the new sea route. Senior US military officials stated that American troops would not set foot on Gaza's shores. Instead, US soldiers and sailors will reside aboard naval vessels while delivery of aid ashore will be handled by a \"third party\". This third party is still mysterious, but expectations are that Britain and the United Arab Emirates will play a role in distributing aid on the ground.\n\nThe UK is reportedly contemplating assigning the task to British troops when the aid corridor becomes operational. However, Whitehall sources stress that no definitive decision has been reached, and the issue has not yet reached the prime minister's desk. Nevertheless, Britain has been actively involved in planning the pier. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps also reiterated the UK's prominent role in coordinating support efforts with the US and other international allies. If British forces are engaged, they will unload trucks from landing craft onto the temporary causeway and deliver aid to a secure distribution area onshore.\n\nLast March US President Joe Biden unveiled the proposal to construct a \"temporary pier\" along the Mediterranean coast of Gaza aimed at establishing a vital maritime channel for aid to Gaza. The European Union, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the US contributed to the project in various capacities.\n\nAccording to the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, the maritime corridor concept originated from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who purportedly broached the idea to Biden in October 2023 and revisited it during discussions with the US president in January.\n\nThe extent of Israel's involvement in managing the temporary pier remains somewhat ambiguous. Initially, Biden stated that Israel would oversee the security of the pier. However, subsequent American sources indicated that Israel would not be responsible for pier security. Instead, they clarified that Israel's role would solely involve inspecting and approving goods destined for Gaza through the pier.\n\nThe lack of a clear, comprehensive vision or precise details regarding the role of this temporary pier raises significant doubts about its objectives. When the White House announced the temporary pier project, the US administration faced harsh ridicule and criticism from international humanitarian organisations. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) labelled it a stark diversion from the fundamental issue of Israel's indiscriminate and disproportionate military actions and the punitive blockade. \"This isn't merely a logistical challenge; it's fundamentally a political issue,\" the group emphasised. \"The essential provisions of food, water, and medical supplies urgently required by the people in Gaza are readily available just across the border.\"\n\nMichael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, also sharply criticised what he called \"absurd\" US proposals for delivering aid to Gaza, whether through airdrops or the establishment of a temporary port. \"From humanitarian, international, and human rights standpoints, it is absurd in a profoundly cynical manner,\" he remarked.\n\nThe floating causeway, expected to span five hundred metres, would be securely anchored into the sand. This new maritime corridor, dubbed the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) operation, aims to deliver up to 150 trucks of aid per day once fully operational. Aid shipments from Cyprus would be transferred onto the pier before being loaded onto trucks and smaller landing craft. It is a lengthy, intricate, and logistically challenging process that yields only a limited amount of humanitarian aid compared to land routes.\n\nEuropean diplomatic sources suggest that the Biden administration may have conceded to Israel's proposal to establish a temporary naval pier on the coast of Gaza in exchange for Israel's pledge not to launch a large-scale attack on Rafah or take unilateral actions without coordination with the United States.\n\nThere are concerns that the suspension of work on the temporary pier could be linked to the breakdown of coordination between the United States and Israel, and the growing differences between them. This might have prompted Washington to halt construction as a means of pressuring Tel Aviv. Washington has consistently voiced its opposition to a major military operation in Rafah without guarantees to protect civilians. However, Netanyahu insists on launching an offensive under the pretext of eliminating the remaining Hamas fighters. And while the United States advocates for a ceasefire leading to a political resolution, the Israeli government remains steadfast in its desire to attack Rafah, even in the event of a ceasefire agreement and a prisoner exchange.\n\nDespite attempts to bridge the gap between the United States and Israel, it appears that the divide is widening significantly as the conflict reaches critical stages. The Israeli objective behind the temporary pier is to create conditions that would effectively strangle the Gaza Strip by controlling and closing the main land crossings, particularly the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings.\n\nSome analysts speculate that this move could be a strategic manoeuvre aimed at marginalising Egypt as a link between the Gaza Strip and the international community. This could potentially diminish the coastal enclave's economic and political dependence on Egypt, particularly through the Egyptian-administered Rafah crossing, which serves as the primary entry and exit point for most of Gaza's population.\n\nSuch a strategy would ostensibly strengthen Israel's control over the Gaza Strip without relying on Egyptian cooperation, irrespective of its past reliability. It appears that the primary objective of the temporary pier, a long-standing Israeli ambition, is to reinforce the complete blockade around Gaza and sever the Strip's connections with the outside world.\n\nAlso a significant aim for Israel is to lay the groundwork for the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians by turning the Gaza Strip into an unlivable place, which leaves many Palestinians no choice but to seek refuge in other countries. Most critically, the pier, and the possible closure of all crossings and land roads between Gaza and the West Bank, pose a significant risk of geographical, demographic and political separation between Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and East Jerusalem, effectively undermining the prospects for a territorially contiguous Palestinian state.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg",

It remains to be seen when the floating pier will be in place.\n\nThe US military completed the creation of a floating pier that is supposed to be positioned off the coast of Gaza. However, currently, a spate of bad weather has kept the temporary pier from being positioned in place off the coast, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\n\"As of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS -- the floating pier and the Trident pier -- are complete and awaiting final movement offshore,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. \"Today, there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells, which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved.\"\n\nPier to facilitate aid from Cyprus, among others\n\nThe swell on May 8 had reduced to around half a meter off the coast, but winds continued at around 15 knots. It remains to be seen when the floating pier will be in place. Once in place, the pier will be able to receive aid from Cyprus and other places, and then the aid can be brought to shore and stored at a site the IDF has created on land. That site is around 60 acres and will be able to hold containers and move them onto trucks for transport. This entire operation is complex. It took around two months to get this to happen. Small US army ships had to travel across the Atlantic and then through Crete to get here. Other ships were also sent to help.\n\nIt is unclear if the \"sea state conditions\" that have made it hard to put the pier in place will continue to be a problem. If the pier has to be moved or cannot be used in a heavy sea state, then it could cause other logistical issues for the movement of aid. However, the sea is expected to be better in the spring and summer, making this unique US capability more relevant.\n\nThe big question, though, is how this will change the situation in Gaza. With fighting in Rafah, the pier can help to pick up the slack of aid being moved into Gaza. There are also other crossing points the IDF opened in the last two months, including a crossing point in the north and one at Erez. The IDF also re-opened the Kerem Shalom crossing on May 8. Aid is also being moved through Ashdod and coming from Jordan. In addition, airdrops of aid continue to happen in Gaza.\n\nThe report at Stars and Stripes says that \"in the meantime, the U.S. is loading aid on the ship, MV Sagamore, currently in Cyprus.\" The US says the vessel will be able to make trips back and forth to Cyprus. The Sagamore, according to the vessel information website Vessel Finder, says that this is an 184-meter cargo ship built in 2008.

It remains to be seen when the floating pier will be in place. Once it is and will be able to receive aid, that aid can be brought to shore and stored at a site the IDF has created on land. That site is around 24 hectares (60 acres) and will be able to hold containers and move them onto trucks for transport.\n\nThis is a complex operation, one that took around two months to get off the ground, and included US Army ships that traveled across the Atlantic, through Crete, to Gaza.\n\nIt is unclear if the \"sea state conditions\" that have made it hard to put the pier in place will continue to be a problem. If the pier has to be moved or cannot be used in a heavy sea state, then it could cause other logistical issues for the movement of aid. However, the sea is expected to be better in the spring and summer, making this unique capability more relevant.\n\nThe big question though is how this will change the situation in Gaza. With fighting in Rafah, the pier can help to pick up the slack of aid being moved in. There are also other crossing points the IDF opened in the last two months, including a crossing point in the north and one at Erez. The military also re-opened the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday. Aid is also being moved through Ashdod and coming from Jordan, and is also being airdropped.\n\nThe report at Stars and Stripes says that \"in the meantime, the US is loading aid on the ship, MV Sagamore, currently in Cyprus.\" The US says the vessel will be able to make trips back and forth to Cyprus. The Sagamore, according to vessel information website Vessel Finder, is an 184-meter cargo ship built in 2008. The pier's creation is a major success for the US to showcase that this capability can work.

She highlighted the completion of both the Trident pier and the floating pier sections, marking a crucial milestone in the JLOTS project.\n\nSingh revealed that the cargo ship MV Sagamore is currently docked in Cyprus, undergoing loading with humanitarian aid destined for Gaza. The Sagamore, a U.S.-registered commercial vessel, will utilize the JLOTS system to transport aid between Cyprus and a temporary floating pier located several miles off the coast of Gaza.\n\nThe operational process involves unloading cargo from the Sagamore onto Army-owned landing craft utility ships (LCUs) and logistic support vessels (LSVs) at sea. These vessels will then proceed towards Gaza, where they will rendezvous with the Trident pier. Upon arrival, trucks onboard the LCUs and LSVs will drive onto the pier, facilitating the staging of humanitarian aid supplies for distribution within Gaza.\n\nInitial projections anticipate approximately 90 truckloads of supplies transiting the causeway daily, with the capacity to increase to 150 trucks per day once operations reach full capacity. Singh outlined a phased approach, likening the initial stages to a \"crawl, walk, run\" scenario to ensure the smooth functioning of the system.\n\nWhile acknowledging the significance of the JLOTS system, Singh emphasized that it complements, rather than replaces, existing land routes for aid delivery into Gaza. She reiterated the importance of opening land crossings to facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance seamlessly.\n\nDespite the completion of construction, deployment of the JLOTS capability has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions. The floating and Trident piers, currently situated off the coast of Israel near the Port of Ashdod, are unable to be moved to their final location due to forecasted high winds and sea swells.\n\nSince March 2, U.S. Central Command, in collaboration with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, has conducted nearly 40 humanitarian missions, airdropping close to 1,200 tons of aid into Gaza.

Aid workers question its role", "body": "A U.S. Navy ship docks off the coast of the Gaza Valley area in the central Gaza Strip on April 29, 2024. The ship is expected to participate in the construction work of a floating naval dock to deliver more humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip announced in March.\n\nAs early as this weekend, some 90 trucks will roll off a metal causeway onto a beach in Gaza.\n\nThen the United Nations will deliver the much-needed food and medicine to Palestinians, some of whom are already suffering famine conditions. The United Nations said half of Gaza's more than 2 million people are starving.\n\nBut questions remain about whether this will be a successful operation. Senior military officials say tens of thousands of desperate residents could cluster at the end of the causeway, snarling the trucks and denying much needed aid.\n\nThere are also security concerns. Recently two mortars landed in the marshaling area in Gaza that will receive the trucks, causing minor damage.\n\nOfficials say the effort will begin with 90 trucks per day and soon ramp up to 150. But that's not enough, humanitarian officials say, noting that 500 trucks per day rolled into Gaza from land crossings before the October 7th Hamas attack.\n\nU.S. officials say aid from the sea and causeway are meant to supplement the more efficient land crossings. But with the Rafah border crossing now closed, rimmed with Israeli tanks, and an Israeli military operation is imminent, the situation is now even more dire.\n\nThe U.S.-led initiative, which President Biden first touted in his March State of the Union as an important measure to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the region, was slated to begin operating by early May.\n\nAt a Department of Defense briefing Tuesday, officials said the pier itself is complete but that weather complications play a factor in delaying its operations. On Monday, National Security spokesman John Kirby said security arrangements for those delivering the aid are still being worked out.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have described the pier as a supplement -- not a replacement -- for existing aid distribution efforts, humanitarian aid groups say that the port is a \"performative\" aid operation that will make minimal headway in addressing the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe Department of Defense began work on the construction of the pier after Biden announced it in March, with the goal of starting initial operations 60 days later. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the federal agency for coordinating U.S. humanitarian assistance globally, is partnering with the Department of Defense to facilitate aid distribution.\n\nThe operation comes as the Biden administration continues to face pressure to provide greater humanitarian relief to the Palestinian people. In March, U.S.-led efforts to air-drop aid into Gaza began, and the president has admonished Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if Israel fails to do more to protect civilians, aid workers and address the growing humanitarian crisis, there could be a possible change to U.S. policy and security assistance.\n\nThe U.S. Army and U.S. Navy are working jointly to construct a floating platform, along with a temporary pier off the Gaza Strip. Biden made it clear, however, that \"no U.S. boots will be on the ground\" in Gaza.\n\nShipments of aid will first arrive in Cyprus, according to USAID. Before the shipments leave for Gaza from Cyprus, Israeli officials will inspect the deliveries. The ships will then deliver the aid to a floating platform further out from shore, and then smaller vessels will move the aid to the pier itself, which is located on the shore of the Gaza Strip. Trucks deployed by another group would then bring shipments to the rest of Gaza over land.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the World Food Program (WFP) will play a key role in delivering the aid. Security is a top concern, and questions remain about safety for any aid group working to deliver aid from the pier. More than 200 aid workers have died in the war, and the recent killing of seven foreign aid workers with World Central Kitchen, who died in targeted Israeli airstrikes, catapulted the issue into the global spotlight.\n\nBut Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the WFP, was unable to elaborate on its role in the operation.\n\n\"The details are still being worked out,\" Etefa said.\n\nUSAID did not respond with answers to NPR's questions about the the pier and how humanitarian aid would be delivered.\n\nDeepmala Mahla, chief humanitarian officer for CARE, which has not been approached about supporting the pier operation, was blunt in her appraisal.\n\n\"Generally there is a sense of frustration: Why are we not focusing on land borders and why are we bringing these distractions?\" she said of the pier.\n\nAid distribution efforts by land have faced significant delays because the Erez Crossing, the only border crossing between the northern part of the Gaza Strip and Israel, had been closed for months until it reopened this month. Israeli military also seized the Rafah border crossing earlier this week, which the U.N. warns could further restrict the distribution of aid to the Palestinian people. That, plus bottlenecks at the critical Kerem Shalom crossing, on the southeastern edge of Gaza, due to lengthy inspections, frustrates Mahla.\n\n\"I do not know of a situation where hundreds and hundreds of trucks laden with lifesaving aid are just a few miles away from the border, where over 95% of the people are in need,\" Mahla said. \"The only way -- the best way -- to save lives at this moment is to let the trucks in.\"\n\nKate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy with Mercy Corps, said the construction of a pier wouldn't mitigate ongoing challenges that humanitarian organizations, such as Mercy Corps, face.\n\n\"The sort of novel creation of a port and a floating pier does not necessarily address any of the real problems that we've been facing as humanitarian organizations in delivering that aid in a consistent and safe manner, at scale, to populations across Gaza,\" she said. \"We're facing these famine-like metrics right now across Gaza because what has been getting in through those low land crossings hasn't been coming in at the volume or the speed to the people who need it -- enough that now we have half of the population actively starving to death.\"\n\nPhillips-Barrasso said what Mercy Corps and other humanitarian organizations say would help most -- more so than a pier -- would be a ceasefire.\n\n\"Unless the fighting stops, we can't safely deliver aid at the level that is needed,\" Phillips-Barrasso said. \"We have been very clear that what's really driving the humanitarian situation -- it's the siege.\"", "source":

Try that again. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few things at the top, and then happy to jump in and take your question.\n\nSo earlier today, Secretary Austin spoke with Ukraine's Minister of Defense Umarov regarding Ukraine's most pressing security assistance needs. The Secretary and the Minister discussed the ongoing U.S. security assistance efforts following the passage of the National Security Supplemental, including the recent $1 billion presidential drawdown package and $6 billion in Ukraine security assistance initiative announcements. Minister Umerov provided an update of dynamics on the battlefield, as well as the impact of Russia's continued aerial attacks across Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, Secretary Austin also met today with His Majesty King Abdullah II today to discuss regional areas of mutual concern and opportunities for cooperation. A readout of their meeting will be available on defense.gov later today.\n\nNow, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts with USAID to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, or also known as JLOTS. As of today, the U.S. military has completed the offshore construction of the Trident Pier section, or the causeway, which is the component that will eventually be anchored to the Gaza Shore. And as I mentioned last week, construction of the floating pier section has also been completed. So as of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS, the floating pier and the Trident pier, are complete and awaiting final movement offshore.\n\nAs you know, late last week, CENTCOM temporarily paused moving the floating pier and Trident Pier toward the vicinity of Gaza due to sea state considerations. Today, there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved, so the pier sections and military vessels involved in its construction are still positioned at the Port of Ashdod. However, as CENTCOM stands by to move the pier into position in the near future, and again, in partnership with USAID, we're loading humanitarian aid onto the MV Sagamore, which is currently in Cyprus. The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world. And as we've previously briefed, aid delivered to the floating pier will then be transloaded onto U.S. military logistics support vessels and subsequently transported to the Trident Pier, or the causeway, where it will be loaded onto trucks for onward delivery and distribution by humanitarian assistance NGOs.\n\nSwitching gears, I'd like to highlight the start of a new Exercise Astral Night, a U.S. European Command integrated air and missile defense capstone exercise, which is part of the Defense Department's large-scale Global Exercise 2024 Program. This two-week exercise, now in its sixth year, will feature live, flying and simulated combat scenarios focused in Poland and the Baltic states. Nearly 5,000 military members and more than 50 aircraft from six NATO nations, which include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States, will participate side-by-side, strengthening our ability to operate as one cohesive force.\n\nAstral Knight underscores the importance of integrated air and missile defense in protecting allied military forces and critical assets from aerial threats, such as missiles or drones, and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to the security and readiness of our allies in Europe.\n\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. I'll start off with Lita.\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina. Two things.\n\nOne, can you give us an update on the soldier who's being held in Russia? Do you have a sense - apparently there's, like, a July 2nd trial or some sort of date. Do you have some sort of sense of what's happening there? If you could just fill in the blanks?\n\nAnd do you know is it a violation of a regulation of some sort? Does he face disciplinary action because he did not seek or receive authorization for the international travel if that's clear?\n\nAnd then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nMS. SINGH: OK. I'll start with this and then happy to take your additional questions.\n\nSo for more information, I would refer you to the Army, but what I can tell you from here is that Staff Sergeant Gordon C. Black enlisted in the U.S. Army as an infantryman was was enlisted as an infantryman in 2008. He was most recently assigned to Eighth Army, U.S. Forces Korea, at Camp Humphreys in the Republic of South Korea.\n\nOn April 10th, Black out-processed from Eighth Army and signed out on permanent change of station to leave en route to Texas. However, instead of returning to the U.S., Black flew from Korea through China and then to Vladivostok, Russia for personal reasons.\n\nAs of right now, Black is currently in a pre-trial detention facility. It's my understanding he will remain there until his next hearing. And I'm not sure on that date. I'd refer you to State Department on that.\n\nThe Army has opened an administrative investigation to determine the facts and the circumstances surrounding his travel, but to your question on, you know, will there be consequences for his actions, that's something that the Army's going to look into through their investigation.\n\nBut official or any leave to Russia is strictly prohibited, and that's pursuant to the DOD foreign clearance guide, which of course is also informed by the State Department guidelines, which right now I believe it's Category 4, which is do not travel to Russia.\n\nSo that's the sort of overview of where things stand right now.\n\nQ: ... will the Sagamore wait in Cyprus until the pier is actually attached to this shoreline? And at - at a certain point, do you have sort of an - even an ETA on when the sea states might be calm enough to do it? Is the aid process ready so that once the sea state calms down, that can start?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I believe they will the Sagamore transiting to - to, you know, the floating pier will happen in conjunction when it's - when everything is sort of ready to fit into place. I don't think one would happen without the other.\n\nSo aid is continuing to get loaded on. Once the commander feels that, you know, the Sagamore is ready to leave and that the sea states have calmed, we will position the JLOTS into place. I don't have an exact date for you cause it is of course weather and environment depending, but we're hoping for later this week, but that does depend of course on the environmental conditions and if - and security conditions as well, but right now, we're focused on the environmental conditions surrounding the anchoring of that pier.\n\nLara?\n\nQ: Thanks, Sabrina. I have one follow-up and then a different question.\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure.\n\nQ: On the Sagamore, how much aid can that ship hold, in terms of truckloads? And is this the only ship that's taking advantage of the pier? I guess I'm wondering that - kind of - the throughput of aid and how that's going to work, how many trucks a day.\n\nMS. SINGH: You know, I don't have an exact estimate on how much - how many, like, pallets it can load. I'm happy to get back to you on that one. I think it will vary just on how much, you know, different things that are packed onto it.\n\nAnd then I'm sorry, in terms if - it - will this be the only one going back and forth from the floating pier?\n\nQ: What I am trying to get at is a senior defense official told us I think last week that it's - that it's going to - the JLOTS is going to be able to - to provide 150 trucks a day at full operational capability, but that just seems low to me considering that it's a maritime route. It seems like a ship would hold more than that. So I'm wondering ...\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, I mean, you have to remember this is a temporary pier, this is not the best way to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. The best way are through those land routes, and we do want to see those opened up, we do want to see aid continue to flow in through those land crossings.\n\nThis is just one. It's meant to help augment, to help compliment other ways that aid can get in, not just through land routes but of course we're also doing those airdrops that you continue to see us do on a regular basis.\n\nI mean, 150 trucks is at its - you know, when it's fully operational. I think you're - what you're going to see at the very beginning is a crawl, walk, run scenario, is we're going to start with, you know, an additional small amount of aid trucks to flow in to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase of course when we get to full operational capacity.\n\nBut that's something that the commander is continuing to work through. For more aid - like, for more aid questions on the Sagamore and what it's help - holding, I would refer you to USAID.\n\nQ: And then just on a separate topic, is the U.S. considering the use of private military companies to help distribute aid in Gaza?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not aware of that but that's something that - USAID would be able to speak more to the distribution of aid once it gets into Gaza. So I'd refer you to them.\n\nI also realize that you asked about the Sagamore being the only ship going back and forth. Just as a reminder, commercial ships can also go up to that floating pier. It's the military ships, the LCUs and LSVs that take the aid from the floating pier to the causeway. That is only military. But commercial ships can go up once they're - other ships can once they are - once aid is loaded in Cyprus, inspected, it goes to the floating pier.\n\nTom?\n\nQ: The U.S. has asked for a humanitarian plan for any Rafah operation. Have you guys received anything from the Israelis about how they're going to handle humanitarian effort, especially if Rafah gate closes?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, we've had conversations with the Israelis. There was a - a - a delegation here a few weeks ago that, you know, gave a general, broad overview of their plans. We are not supportive of a large ground incursion into Rafah. We are very concerned that - that, you know, there are over one million people sheltering there. We want to make sure that civilian casualties are limited, that there is no harm done. So we have made those concerns voiced both - both publicly and privately.\n\nQ: Can you give us a sense of what they said to you about their humanitarian plan?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm, as you can appreciate, just not going to get into closed door discussions, but as you know and as we regularly read out, the Secretary has regular calls with Minister Gallant, and other folks from this building with their counterparts as well, so we're certainly in touch with the Israelis.\n\nBut we certainly do not support and have expressed our views on a major ground operation within Rafah.\n\nQ: So are you satisfied with what you're hearing about their humanitarian plan?\n\nMS. SINGH: I mean, again, I'm not going to get into private conversations. We want to see a - we want to see a concrete plan that will take into account the over one million people that are there right now. We don't support a large ground operation into Rafah.\n\nQ: Ms. Singh, I think Pat mentioned the security situation as one of the factors that could impact the timing (multiple speakers) Gaza. Has -- have the Israel strikes and sort of limited operation in Rafah changed your view of the security situation? Are you now more concerned about it, given what happened yesterday in Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: We're certainly taking into account the security consideration but still nothing has changed. We're still moving forward with the implementation of JLOTS. We do need these sea state conditions to steady. And until they do we're just not able to move that into that -- into the -- into it's location at this time. But of course the security situation is something that we're going to monitor and if that does impact anything when it comes to the JLOTS mission we would -- we would let you know.\n\nQ: I realize your policy you don't send any weapons to Israel has not changed, saying some shipments have been paused. What are the -- what message are you trying to send to Israel with those pause in shipments?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I don't have a -- I've seen those reports. I don't have a comment and I certainly wouldn't comment on specific cases or shipments. What I can reiterate is that our commitment to Israel security remains iron clad. You've seen that since October 7th. You've seen a surge security assistance to Israel. You've seen us come to the defense of Israel as recently as a few weeks ago when Iran launched attacks towards Israel.\n\nWe also were able to pass an emergency supplemental that surged additional security assistance to Israel. So while I'm not going to comment any further I can tell you that our commitments to Israel security remains the same.\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina.\n\nWere you given any heads up from your Israeli counterparts about this latest operation into Rafah? What is your understanding? You said we will not support the major operation. Is this part for major operation or limited? What is the information available to you?\n\nMS. SINGH: Our understanding is that this was a very limited operation designed to cut off Hamas' ability to smuggle more weapons and funding into Gaza. That is our understanding right now.\n\nThis just happened, I think, very early morning hours here. So we're monitoring the situation, we're in touch with our Israeli counterparts. We're going to see how this unfolds but I just don't have more for you to offer on like what this operation is other than that.\n\nQ: Can you -- according to UNRWA, this operation and -- and prior Israeli steps basically cut off all humanitarian aid into Gaza. All crossings are shutdown.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: OK, according to the UNRWA, this operation and prior Israeli steps basically cut off all humanitarian aid into Gaza. All crossings are shut down. Sadly, this one area, Rafah, obviously. You've been insisting, and the Secretary, in every read out that there should be an urgent increase in humanitarian aid. Is this operation and the closing of the Rafah crossing, meet your objectives in terms of your humanitarian situation in Gaza?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, we don't support the closing of these land routes. We want to see humanitarian aid to continue to get in. And so I think that was something that the president spoke to in his call with Prime Minister Netanyahu is that we do want to see these crossings open. Kerem Shalom has been closed for, I think, a bit now.\n\nSo we do want to see more aid be able to get through these crossing. That is a commitment that the Israeli government has made that they will. Again, we are -- we are continuing to monitor the situation on the ground.\n\nTo Lara's question earlier, we know land routes are the best, most effective, efficient way to get humanitarian aid in and we know that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. And so people need the medical supplies, the food, the water. That is something that we want to see continue to get in and we have been told that these crossings will open back up. In the meantime, you know, we've also continued to conduct humanitarian airdrops within Gaza. And should we get to the time and point where we're able to position this temporary pier off the coast of Gaza that will also help with humanitarian aid getting in. Warren.\n\nQ: A question on Rafah to follow up on Fadi's question. And then a question on the soldier in Russia.\n\nMS. SINGH: OK.\n\nQ: In the discussions about what you call the general broad overview of Israel's Rafah plans, was there discussion about this limited operation or was there no discussion about this previously with you between America and Israel?\n\nMS. SINGH: So we don't have more to share in terms of the conversation between Minister Gallant and Secretary Austin. But as you can appreciate, they talk pretty regularly. Their conversations are already -- are very direct, very frank with each other. But I'm just not going to go into more details on that.\n\nQ: Is this how soon Rafah could function again as one of the most important crossings?\n\nMS. SINGH: That would be something for the Israeli government to speak to. I can't speak to that.\n\nQ: And then a follow up question on Staff Sergeant Gordon Black. Is there any suspicion or concern that in his relationship with his Russian girlfriend or while in Russia he compromised sensitive information? And is that part of the ongoing investigation?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd refer you to Army for more information on that. As I mentioned, there is an administrative investigation underway to determine the facts, to determine what exactly happened here, the -- surrounding his travel. But I just don't have more thing on that.\n\nYes, Joe.\n\nQ: Thanks. The Biden administration is required to notify Congress by tomorrow if Israel violated the national law without humanitarian aid since October. Is it the department -- what's the department's assessment in terms of either one of those? Have they violated or had they without humanitarian aid?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I believe you're referring to the NSM? And that's something that I would have to refer you to State to speak to.\n\nQ: And has the Pentagon assessed that Israel has violated the international law or withheld humanitarian?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have anything to add on to this one. This is something that the State Department is putting together. It's a report to Congress that is, you know, due every -- however many increments. But I just don't have more at this time to offer on the NSM in particular.\n\nQ: That being said, human rights watch came out with a report and said, there was a March 27th attack on emergency and relief workers. And several of them in Southern Lebanon by Israel. And they say that a U.S. made JDAM was used, as well as a 500-pound Israeli bomb. It killed, like I said, at least several individuals who were civilians. And there's been no evidence of a military target at the site. Are you guys aware of this, how close -- I mean, we've seen -- you've said before that there are no conditions on U.S. military weapons provided -- or weapons provided to Israel. Are you guys tracking these kinds of things at all? And are you aware of this attack?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I'm not going to get into specific incidents. And I can't confirm those reports that you're citing U.S. weapons being used. What I can tell you is that we have been very clear that we want to see Israel comply with humanitarian laws and the laws of armed conflict. This is something that it's an interagency process that between the State Department, other agencies, we are reviewing. Our findings will also go into the NSM. For more on that. I'm just not going to get ahead of that process as you can appreciate. I'd refer you to the State Department.\n\nQ: The IKE has returned to the Red Sea. We saw a statement a couple -- I guess a couple weeks ago now that it had gone into the Sixth Fleet, into Europe. Can you say anything about -- and then, you know, on April 23rd, CENTCOM released the -- or put out a tweet and said there were F-16s deployed to AOR but didn't specify where. Can you say anything about -- can you give us any updates on this, I guess, mission to counter and deter the Houthis. Is the IKE -- has it been deployed -- has the deployment extended?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I don't have anything for you on any changes to our force posture with the Ike or anything additional. You have the positioning of our assets there for the exact reason to help with deterrence and our efforts when it comes to Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is to ensure that commercial shipping through the Red Sea, the BAM, the Gulf of Aden, can continue freely without the harassment of Houthi attacks.\n\nYou've seen CENTCOM put out, you know, regular updates on when there are engagements. But I don't have anything more to read out at this time on the IKE.\n\nLiz.\n\nQ: Last week, Secretary Austin told lawmakers, he was concerned over a \"lack of execution\" in terms of Israel's plans to evacuate civilians from Gaza. Is that still the case? Is he still concerned about the lack of execution?\n\nMS. SINGH: I think we are concerned about any type of ground operation, large ground operation within Rafah that does not take into account that very large civilian population. So yes, the Secretary's words still absolutely stand until today .\n\nQ: Follow up from Joseph's question. So was the USS IKE brought back into the Red Sea to counter the Houthis because there were increased attacks in the eastern event?\n\nMS. SINGH: Again, I don't have the list of attacks that happened when she was not in the Red Sea. But, you know, we have other partner nations that are part of Operation Prosperity Guardian and others that are not, that were engaging when the Houthis did fire attacks unlawfully at commercial vessels. I think I read out, you know, when she -- I said that she would be back soon. She has returned. But I just don't have more for you on anything additional or any extension. I'm just going to go to the phones before I forget and then come back into the room here. Jared Szuba, Al-Monitor.\n\nQ: Hi, Sabrina. Thanks for doing this. I understand that the Israeli officials told White House counterparts that last night's Rafah -- Operation Rahaf was limited. But what preparations are you seeing the Israeli military make? Does it look like they're setting up for broader ground clearing, major ground operations, or does it look like they're preparing for something more precise, and targeted, and surgical? Thanks.\n\nMS. SINGH: Thanks, Jared, for the question. So in terms of what they're doing, their actual planning when it comes to any operation, I would refer you to the IDF to speak to that. What I can tell you. And I'm not trying to sound like a broken record here, what I can tell you is publicly and privately, we've been very clear that we do not support a large ground incursion into Rafah, given the incredibly large civilian population that is currently sheltered there. And so, you know, I just have to reiterate that point again.\n\nAll right. Next question. J.J. Green WTOP.\n\nQ: Hey. Sabrina, thank you. Two quick questions about the Staff Sergeant Black. First one, can you address the significance of an active duty service member? Being in Russian custody, given Russia's efforts to, I guess, essentially seek out and find and capture Americans and to use them for political purposes or geopolitical purposes. Can you address the significance first of an active duty U.S. service member being in Russian custody?\n\nThanks, J.J. So before I start going down this line, I would just remind you that the Army is looking into this. They have an administrative investigation underway to determine the facts and circumstances around this travel.\n\nYou have to remember that, yes, this is an active duty service member, but he was on leave at the time. And so, you know, all we know is that he went to Russia for personal reasons. I don't have more to share as that -- is that the Army is continuing to look into this incident. And for further questions on his condition or next steps, I'd refer you to the State Department for more on that.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, did you have a follow-up?\n\nQ: You know, actually, I'll skip that, but thank you for answering that question.\n\nMS. SINGH: Of course. All right, I'll come back in the room. Yes, right over here?\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina. The ceasefire - sorry - the ceasefire proposal that Hamas has said - said they will accept, is this same offer that's been on the table for a long time? And have you reviewed it with your partners?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I would refer you to the State Department. And as you are probably aware, Bill Burns is in the region and sort of leading these negotiations. So I - I don't want to speak from here about the ceasefire or hostage negotiations that are taking place, other than that they are underway and, you know, we have a representative at the table as well working to see - to ensure that some - that a ceasefire could be put into place.\n\nIf a sea side - if - if a ceasefire were to be put into place, that obviously would increase chances of more humanitarian aid to get in to Gaza and of course release more hostages, which is obviously something we want to see.\n\nQ: On Russia - Vladimir Putin order his forces to rehearse for a non-strategic nuclear weapon. How do you look at it? And have you seen any change in Russia's posture on nuclear terms.\n\nMS. SINGH: How do we look at what Russia announced? We look at that as completely irresponsible. We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture. We haven't seen any indications that Russia plans to use a nuclear weapon. But it's deeply irresponsible and we're going to continue to monitor what's happening in the region.\n\nYeah?\n\nQ: Sabrina, you've been saying for months now, this administration, that you're against a major military operation of Rafah.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: ... and they told around 100,000 people to evacuate in eastern Rafah, and that sounds like a lot of people. So what's the definition of a major military operation? What makes a limited military operation? What's a major military operation? Is there an acceptable number of civilians that can be put at greater risk for the Pentagon? Like, how - how do we know what's major?\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure. Look, I'm, as you can appreciate, not going to get into more specifics on, like, their operations and some of the things that they brief us on. A major military operation would put at risk civilian lives. Anything that puts at risk civilian lives within Rafah is something that we do - are not supportive of.\n\nWe do not want to see a population with over one million people who were, you know, directed there when other operations were going on in the north and the west, were forced into Rafah - we don't want to see the civilian population put at risk, knowing that also there is tremendous hurdles of also getting humanitarian aid in, medical supplies in.\n\nAnd so any type of a military operation must take into account that large concentration of civilians, and right now, we haven't seen a - we - we need to see a credible plan that would protect those civilians. And so we're continuing to urge and - and speak to our Israeli counterparts about that plan, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: You know, over 100,000 people were told to leave the area. That sounds like an alarming development because they can be put at greater risk. So this line that's drawn in the sand, how do you make sure that Israel doesn't cross that?\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah, again, I'm not putting a specific number on it, on, like, how many people or - need to leave or how many, you know - what a large-scale operation looks like cause I'm not going to detail their own plans and what they share with us. That's something for them to speak to.\n\nWhat I can tell you is we have a large population of civilians that are sheltered in Rafah. They need to be protected if there is any type of operation or any type of major ground incursion into Rafah. And we want to see those civilians protected. And to move over one million people, that's going to take a lot of time.\n\nSo we're - we're continuing to work with our Israeli counterparts, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nYeah, in the back? Carla?\n\nQ: Thanks. I - VOA was told by a U.S. military official that - in Niger that some of the diplomatic clearances for flights have been denied. That's forced extended deployments. The day-to-day life sustainment is continuing very - via commercial contact - contract transportation. These raise a lot of questions.\n\nAnd what's going on with the U.S. forces in Niger right now? Are they allowed to leave? Are they getting the medical supplies and equipment and ammunition, et cetera, everything that they need? And why is - what reason is Niger giving the Pentagon for why they're denying some of the diplomatic clearances?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd direct you to the CNSP to speak to why they're denying some of the diplomatic clearances. We are working with the CNSP on what our orderly withdrawal looks like. As of right now, our forces in Niger still continue to have access to necessary food, water, medical supplies that they need, but this is of course something that we are working towards on what that orderly withdrawal looks like. There have been some cases where some of our service members have - have left Niger for unforeseen circumstances.\n\nRight now, as a - I think we briefed a few weeks ago, we will have another delegation led by someone from the Department of Defense that will go to Niamey to continue these conversations about the orderly withdrawal. That visit hasn't happened yet. So until that does and until parameters are put around for these negotiations on what the orderly withdrawal looks like, we're still in a bit of this holding pattern until we can have those conversations. Great.\n\nQ: Real quickly if I may on Russia? There have been requests for the Pentagon to kind of detail how Russia is able to use Starlink cause Starlink is also contracted with DOD. Do you have any details to provide on how Russia is able to use that on the battlefield, and what the Pentagon and others are doing to try to prevent that from happening?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have anything specific on Russia using Starlink. As you know, our - our contract with Starlink is for the Ukrainians to use, but I don't have anything more specific on Russia using Starlink.\n\nAnri.\n\nQ: Yeah, thanks so much. My question is about the South China Sea. Recently, we have seen the Chinese dangerous options towards Philippines vessels, but recently, Chinese government argued that there was a temporary special agreement with the former Philippine President Duterte in 2016 and - about the restricted access by Philippine vessels, and China accused the Philippines side of the recent tensions. So can I ask for your comment on this Chinese claim?\n\nMS. SINGH: Are you talking about, like, the firing of water cannons, things like that towards Philippine vessels?\n\nQ: Yes, and China claims that there was a hidden agreement with the Philippines side.\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not exactly clear, maybe not understanding about an agreement that you're referring to, but of course we continue to monitor what's happening in the South China Sea, we continue to be alarmed when these incidents happen, whether it be with Philippine vessels or other vessels. We want to be able to see the - you know, the - the freedom of navigation to be upheld. So of course we're going to continue to monitor what's happening there with our partners and allies.\n\nYeah?\n\nQ: Thank you. My question is about another country in Africa, Chad. Could you give me the update on the situation in Chad? Has the withdrawal of the - has the withdrawal of - withdrawal been completed or are there any U.S. personnel remaining in the country?\n\nMS. SINGH: Thanks for the question. So I actually don't have much of an update other than what we provided last week, which is that there were some military personnel that did leave the country. Some of which were already scheduled to rotate out.\n\nWe do still have military personnel in the country at the embassy, but I don't have more of an update for you on that other than that's basically where we were last week.\n\nQ: So the situation hasn't been changed because there was a presidential election yesterday. Yeah.\n\nMS. SINGH: today? Yeah. We're continuing our conversations with the government, but I just don't have more to share at this time. I'll come back in a sec. Let me just go. I have two more on the phones and then happy to come back in the room.\n\nHeather, USNI.\n\nQ: Thanks so much. So the Houthis have said that they're going to stop all ships that enter their operation or zone of operation in the Red Sea. So I have -- and as well as target ships that they can reach with any of their weapons, including in the Med.\n\nSo I have two questions. The first is if there's been any talk of updating the presence in the Red Sea in order to combat this latest threat. And then the second one, is there any concerns about -- or I guess, how is the U.S. prepared to protect ships that are going to be bringing in aid in the Med to the temporary appear from any potential Houthi attacks, considering that the Houthis might not recognize those as age ships versus commercial ships going towards Israel?\n\nMS. SINGH: Hey, thanks, Heather, for the question. I will be candid. I missed a bit of the first part. But in terms of age ships getting into to the Eastern Med, and you're talking about aid being transported from the floating pier to the causeway. As we have said before, we have assurances from the IDF that they would be providing security around that transport, so whether it's any attacks from any group, the IDF, of course, will be providing that security.\n\nIn terms of -- and apologies, I did miss a little bit of the first part of your question. In terms of any posture changes in the Red Sea, no posture changes. Again, Operation Prosperity Guardian is something that continues to work every single day in a coalition to ensure the freedom of navigation through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. I don't have any posture changes to announce today from the podium.\n\nOK. And the last question from the phone. I'm happy to come back in the room. Jeff Schogol, Task & Purpose.\n\nQ: Thank you. I understand the Army has launched an administrative investigation into Staff Sergeant Black. I'm just curious, does DOD have any indications that he may have been lured to Russia as part of an effort by Russian intelligence to detain him?\n\nMS. SINGH: Jeff, appreciate the question. This is something that the Army is looking into, which is why they've been -- they've launched an investigation to determine the facts and the circumstances of his travel. And I just don't have anything more to add at this time.\n\nHappy to come back in the room. OK. We'll do two more. Three more.\n\nQ: Some media is showing pictures that General Kurilla is in Egypt.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: Can you tell us what he's doing there? And if he has any other schedule events?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd refer you to CENTCOM for more details. I don't have more on his travel. He does, you know, regularly travel to the region. I think he was there, if not last week, the week before. But I don't know his other schedule stops. But CENTCOM would be able to provide that information.\n\nQ: We know any part of Director Burns travel to the Egypt today?\n\nMS. SINGH: Not to my awareness. No. Fadi and then Erin.\n\nQ: Sabrina, my question about this Israeli invasion of Rafah, you said it's -- your understanding, this is a limited operation it aims to -- or at cutting off Hamas' capabilities or ability to smuggle weapons and money. However, the process of bringing humanitarian aid through Rafah is controlled by both Egypt and Israel. And Israelis do screen shipments before they get into Rafah.\n\nWere you presented by any information from Israel that proves that still Hamas has the ability to smuggle weapons and money to Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: So Fadi, as -- yeah.\n\nQ: And I just want to note that international organizations, including the U.N., and humanitarian, and NGOs have been complaining about Israel measures that are delaying the entry of humanitarian aid to Rafah through their screening and other steps.\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, I think we've also been very public in our --\n\nMS. SINGH: Let me just finish. So we've been very public and called from this podium from other podiums across, you know, the interagency that we want to see more humanitarian aid get into Gaza. It was directed by the President that we setup a maritime corridor to surge aid in because not enough is getting in. So we also are concerned with how much aid is getting in to Gaza. And that's also why you've seen CENTCOM take the measures that they have to do these airdrops. So I just -- I appreciate the question, but I think also you have to remember that this government has been calling for it repeatedly. We want to see more.\n\nTo your question on Hamas and being able to smuggle weapons, unfortunately, I just can't speak to the intelligence on that. But what I can tell you is that we're continuing to monitor the situation on the ground. We've been very clear about any type of large scale incursion into Rafah. And we know, we know how large that population is down there. And we know how dire the humanitarian situation is. So we do not want to see a large scale ground incursion into Rafah.\n\nAgain, we're continuing to monitor what's happening on the ground. It's just happened earlier, you know, early hours this morning. So I just don't have more to share this time. Sure.\n\nQ: So I understand. And your point of this is well-taken. I'm not talking about the U.S. government effort to bring in more aid or complaining about.\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure.\n\nQ: But this shows the contradiction, which is to say Israel is in control of what loads or does not flow into Gaza without controlling Rafah where they actually had that incursion or invasion. So are you taking what the Israelis are providing you at face value in terms of the aim of this operation is to cut off, the ability to smuggle weapons and money? Or are you going to actually look into those allegations?\n\nWe believe what they are saying that this was a limited operation, that it was to cut off the movement, the traffic of weapons into Gaza through the Rafah crossing. But again, it's something that we're going to continue to monitor. This just happened earlier, you know, a few hours ago, so let us continue to monitor what's happening on the ground.\n\nErin, last question.\n\nQ: Yes. With Israel, you keep using the word ironclad. But now, how is it such an ironclad relationship when we have -- we're expected to delay the shipments of munitions there? So what makes it so ironclad now that we're delaying shipments?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, what makes it ironclad, Erin, is since October 7th, you've seen this government surge humanitarian security assistance and humanitarian support to Israel. So let me just finish. So you've seen us continue to support Israel. I don't need to remind you of the attack that happened a few weeks ago on Israel from Iran where the U.S. partnered with Israel and other coalition forces to defeat that attack.\n\nAgain, I don't have a comment on specific cases or shipments. But what I can tell you is through our actions and through what you've seen since October 7th, that's what we mean when our commitment to Israel and other coalition forces to defeat that attack. Again, I don't have a comment on specific cases or shipments.\n\nBut what I can tell you is through our actions and through what you've seen since October 7th, that's what we mean when our commitment to Israel is ironclad because we continue to stand by our partner and ally in their fight against a terrorist organization who continues to use civilians as human shields. But we also have hard conversations with our friends. And that's what you continue to see the Secretary do at his level and others across this -- across the interagency do as well.\n\nQ: So yesterday morning with General Ryder, he stated that we had not seen a detailed plan about Rafah. Had we seen any plan prior to them entering Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, as I mentioned in a few weeks ago, there was a delegation that was here that, you know, briefed us broadly on their plans for Rafah. We have continued to engage the Israelis. And I think there was a readout at that time from the White House and some of those meetings. We're continuing to engage our Israeli counterparts. I just don't have more to share on their plans.\n\nQ: Not a delegation, but yesterday before they entered, did we know that they were going to go -- had they talked to Secretary Austin prior to entering a couple hours before?\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah, I think I answered that. I think Oren -- asked that question. Look, I'm just not going to get into private -- more details on the private conversations between Secretary Austin and Minister Gallant. Those conversations do happen often. They're frank. They're very direct. And I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: They're listening to Secretary Austin?\n\nMS. SINGH: I do. I do actually think that. And the reason why is because since the beginning, we have seen the Israelis, the IDF make decisions that have been influenced and impacted by conversations with the secretary and other people across this department and the agent -- the interagency. So yes, we do feel like they are listening.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Aid workers question its role", "body": "As early as this weekend, some 90 trucks will roll off a metal causeway onto a beach in Gaza.\n\nThen the United Nations will deliver the much-needed food and medicine to Palestinians, some of whom are already suffering famine conditions. The United Nations said half of Gaza's more than 2 million people are starving.\n\nBut questions remain about whether this will be a successful operation. Senior military officials say tens of thousands of desperate residents could cluster at the end of the causeway, snarling the trucks and denying much needed aid.\n\nThere are also security concerns. Recently two mortars landed in the marshaling area in Gaza that will receive the trucks, causing minor damage.\n\nOfficials say the effort will begin with 90 trucks per day and soon ramp up to 150. But that's not enough, humanitarian officials say, noting that 500 trucks per day rolled into Gaza from land crossings before the October 7th Hamas attack.\n\nU.S. officials say aid from the sea and causeway are meant to supplement the more efficient land crossings. But with the Rafah border crossing now closed, rimmed with Israeli tanks, and an Israeli military operation is imminent, the situation is now even more dire.\n\nThe U.S.-led initiative, which President Biden first touted in his March State of the Union as an important measure to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the region, was slated to begin operating by early May.\n\nAt a Department of Defense briefing Tuesday, officials said the pier itself is complete but that weather complications play a factor in delaying its operations. On Monday, National Security spokesman John Kirby said security arrangements for those delivering the aid are still being worked out.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have described the pier as a supplement -- not a replacement -- for existing aid distribution efforts, humanitarian aid groups say that the port is a \"performative\" aid operation that will make minimal headway in addressing the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe Department of Defense began work on the construction of the pier after Biden announced it in March, with the goal of starting initial operations 60 days later. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the federal agency for coordinating U.S. humanitarian assistance globally, is partnering with the Department of Defense to facilitate aid distribution.\n\nThe operation comes as the Biden administration continues to face pressure to provide greater humanitarian relief to the Palestinian people. In March, U.S.-led efforts to air-drop aid into Gaza began, and the president has admonished Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if Israel fails to do more to protect civilians, aid workers and address the growing humanitarian crisis, there could be a possible change to U.S. policy and security assistance.\n\nThe U.S. Army and U.S. Navy are working jointly to construct a floating platform, along with a temporary pier off the Gaza Strip. Biden made it clear, however, that \"no U.S. boots will be on the ground\" in Gaza.\n\nShipments of aid will first arrive in Cyprus, according to USAID. Before the shipments leave for Gaza from Cyprus, Israeli officials will inspect the deliveries. The ships will then deliver the aid to a floating platform further out from shore, and then smaller vessels will move the aid to the pier itself, which is located on the shore of the Gaza Strip. Trucks deployed by another group would then bring shipments to the rest of Gaza over land.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the World Food Program (WFP) will play a key role in delivering the aid. Security is a top concern, and questions remain about safety for any aid group working to deliver aid from the pier. More than 200 aid workers have died in the war, and the recent killing of seven foreign aid workers with World Central Kitchen, who died in targeted Israeli airstrikes, catapulted the issue into the global spotlight.\n\nBut Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the WFP, was unable to elaborate on its role in the operation.\n\n\"The details are still being worked out,\" Etefa said.\n\nUSAID did not respond with answers to NPR's questions about the the pier and how humanitarian aid would be delivered.\n\nDeepmala Mahla, chief humanitarian officer for CARE, which has not been approached about supporting the pier operation, was blunt in her appraisal.\n\n\"Generally there is a sense of frustration: Why are we not focusing on land borders and why are we bringing these distractions?\" she said of the pier.\n\nAid distribution efforts by land have faced significant delays because the Erez Crossing, the only border crossing between the northern part of the Gaza Strip and Israel, had been closed for months until it reopened this month. Israeli military also seized the Rafah border crossing earlier this week, which the U.N. warns could further restrict the distribution of aid to the Palestinian people. That, plus bottlenecks at the critical Kerem Shalom crossing, on the southeastern edge of Gaza, due to lengthy inspections, frustrates Mahla.\n\n\"I do not know of a situation where hundreds and hundreds of trucks laden with lifesaving aid are just a few miles away from the border, where over 95% of the people are in need,\" Mahla said. \"The only way -- the best way -- to save lives at this moment is to let the trucks in.\"\n\nKate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy with Mercy Corps, said the construction of a pier wouldn't mitigate ongoing challenges that humanitarian organizations, such as Mercy Corps, face.\n\n\"The sort of novel creation of a port and a floating pier does not necessarily address any of the real problems that we've been facing as humanitarian organizations in delivering that aid in a consistent and safe manner, at scale, to populations across Gaza,\" she said. \"We're facing these famine-like metrics right now across Gaza because what has been getting in through those low land crossings hasn't been coming in at the volume or the speed to the people who need it -- enough that now we have half of the population actively starving to death.\"\n\nPhillips-Barrasso said what Mercy Corps and other humanitarian organizations say would help most -- more so than a pier -- would be a ceasefire.\n\n\"Unless the fighting stops, we can't safely deliver aid at the level that is needed,\" Phillips-Barrasso said. \"We have been very clear that what's really driving the humanitarian situation -- it's the siege.\"", "source":

Try that again. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few things at the top, and then happy to jump in and take your question.\n\nSo earlier today, Secretary Austin spoke with Ukraine's Minister of Defense Umarov regarding Ukraine's most pressing security assistance needs. The Secretary and the Minister discussed the ongoing U.S. security assistance efforts following the passage of the National Security Supplemental, including the recent $1 billion presidential drawdown package and $6 billion in Ukraine security assistance initiative announcements. Minister Umerov provided an update of dynamics on the battlefield, as well as the impact of Russia's continued aerial attacks across Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, Secretary Austin also met today with His Majesty King Abdullah II today to discuss regional areas of mutual concern and opportunities for cooperation. A readout of their meeting will be available on defense.gov later today.\n\nNow, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts with USAID to surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability, or also known as JLOTS. As of today, the U.S. military has completed the offshore construction of the Trident Pier section, or the causeway, which is the component that will eventually be anchored to the Gaza Shore. And as I mentioned last week, construction of the floating pier section has also been completed. So as of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS, the floating pier and the Trident pier, are complete and awaiting final movement offshore.\n\nAs you know, late last week, CENTCOM temporarily paused moving the floating pier and Trident Pier toward the vicinity of Gaza due to sea state considerations. Today, there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be moved, so the pier sections and military vessels involved in its construction are still positioned at the Port of Ashdod. However, as CENTCOM stands by to move the pier into position in the near future, and again, in partnership with USAID, we're loading humanitarian aid onto the MV Sagamore, which is currently in Cyprus. The Sagamore is a cargo vessel that will use the JLOTS system and will make trips between Cyprus and the offshore floating pier as USAID and other partners collect aid from around the world. And as we've previously briefed, aid delivered to the floating pier will then be transloaded onto U.S. military logistics support vessels and subsequently transported to the Trident Pier, or the causeway, where it will be loaded onto trucks for onward delivery and distribution by humanitarian assistance NGOs.\n\nSwitching gears, I'd like to highlight the start of a new Exercise Astral Night, a U.S. European Command integrated air and missile defense capstone exercise, which is part of the Defense Department's large-scale Global Exercise 2024 Program. This two-week exercise, now in its sixth year, will feature live, flying and simulated combat scenarios focused in Poland and the Baltic states. Nearly 5,000 military members and more than 50 aircraft from six NATO nations, which include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States, will participate side-by-side, strengthening our ability to operate as one cohesive force.\n\nAstral Knight underscores the importance of integrated air and missile defense in protecting allied military forces and critical assets from aerial threats, such as missiles or drones, and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to the security and readiness of our allies in Europe.\n\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. I'll start off with Lita.\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina. Two things.\n\nOne, can you give us an update on the soldier who's being held in Russia? Do you have a sense - apparently there's, like, a July 2nd trial or some sort of date. Do you have some sort of sense of what's happening there? If you could just fill in the blanks?\n\nAnd do you know is it a violation of a regulation of some sort? Does he face disciplinary action because he did not seek or receive authorization for the international travel if that's clear?\n\nAnd then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nMS. SINGH: OK. I'll start with this and then happy to take your additional questions.\n\nSo for more information, I would refer you to the Army, but what I can tell you from here is that Staff Sergeant Gordon C. Black enlisted in the U.S. Army as an infantryman was was enlisted as an infantryman in 2008. He was most recently assigned to Eighth Army, U.S. Forces Korea, at Camp Humphreys in the Republic of South Korea.\n\nOn April 10th, Black out-processed from Eighth Army and signed out on permanent change of station to leave en route to Texas. However, instead of returning to the U.S., Black flew from Korea through China and then to Vladivostok, Russia for personal reasons.\n\nAs of right now, Black is currently in a pre-trial detention facility. It's my understanding he will remain there until his next hearing. And I'm not sure on that date. I'd refer you to State Department on that.\n\nThe Army has opened an administrative investigation to determine the facts and the circumstances surrounding his travel, but to your question on, you know, will there be consequences for his actions, that's something that the Army's going to look into through their investigation.\n\nBut official or any leave to Russia is strictly prohibited, and that's pursuant to the DOD foreign clearance guide, which of course is also informed by the State Department guidelines, which right now I believe it's Category 4, which is do not travel to Russia.\n\nSo that's the sort of overview of where things stand right now.\n\nQ: ... will the Sagamore wait in Cyprus until the pier is actually attached to this shoreline? And at - at a certain point, do you have sort of an - even an ETA on when the sea states might be calm enough to do it? Is the aid process ready so that once the sea state calms down, that can start?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I believe they will the Sagamore transiting to - to, you know, the floating pier will happen in conjunction when it's - when everything is sort of ready to fit into place. I don't think one would happen without the other.\n\nSo aid is continuing to get loaded on. Once the commander feels that, you know, the Sagamore is ready to leave and that the sea states have calmed, we will position the JLOTS into place. I don't have an exact date for you cause it is of course weather and environment depending, but we're hoping for later this week, but that does depend of course on the environmental conditions and if - and security conditions as well, but right now, we're focused on the environmental conditions surrounding the anchoring of that pier.\n\nLara?\n\nQ: Thanks, Sabrina. I have one follow-up and then a different question.\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure.\n\nQ: On the Sagamore, how much aid can that ship hold, in terms of truckloads? And is this the only ship that's taking advantage of the pier? I guess I'm wondering that - kind of - the throughput of aid and how that's going to work, how many trucks a day.\n\nMS. SINGH: You know, I don't have an exact estimate on how much - how many, like, pallets it can load. I'm happy to get back to you on that one. I think it will vary just on how much, you know, different things that are packed onto it.\n\nAnd then I'm sorry, in terms if - it - will this be the only one going back and forth from the floating pier?\n\nQ: What I am trying to get at is a senior defense official told us I think last week that it's - that it's going to - the JLOTS is going to be able to - to provide 150 trucks a day at full operational capability, but that just seems low to me considering that it's a maritime route. It seems like a ship would hold more than that. So I'm wondering ...\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, I mean, you have to remember this is a temporary pier, this is not the best way to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. The best way are through those land routes, and we do want to see those opened up, we do want to see aid continue to flow in through those land crossings.\n\nThis is just one. It's meant to help augment, to help compliment other ways that aid can get in, not just through land routes but of course we're also doing those airdrops that you continue to see us do on a regular basis.\n\nI mean, 150 trucks is at its - you know, when it's fully operational. I think you're - what you're going to see at the very beginning is a crawl, walk, run scenario, is we're going to start with, you know, an additional small amount of aid trucks to flow in to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase of course when we get to full operational capacity.\n\nBut that's something that the commander is continuing to work through. For more aid - like, for more aid questions on the Sagamore and what it's help - holding, I would refer you to USAID.\n\nQ: And then just on a separate topic, is the U.S. considering the use of private military companies to help distribute aid in Gaza?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not aware of that but that's something that - USAID would be able to speak more to the distribution of aid once it gets into Gaza. So I'd refer you to them.\n\nI also realize that you asked about the Sagamore being the only ship going back and forth. Just as a reminder, commercial ships can also go up to that floating pier. It's the military ships, the LCUs and LSVs that take the aid from the floating pier to the causeway. That is only military. But commercial ships can go up once they're - other ships can once they are - once aid is loaded in Cyprus, inspected, it goes to the floating pier.\n\nTom?\n\nQ: The U.S. has asked for a humanitarian plan for any Rafah operation. Have you guys received anything from the Israelis about how they're going to handle humanitarian effort, especially if Rafah gate closes?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, we've had conversations with the Israelis. There was a - a - a delegation here a few weeks ago that, you know, gave a general, broad overview of their plans. We are not supportive of a large ground incursion into Rafah. We are very concerned that - that, you know, there are over one million people sheltering there. We want to make sure that civilian casualties are limited, that there is no harm done. So we have made those concerns voiced both - both publicly and privately.\n\nQ: Can you give us a sense of what they said to you about their humanitarian plan?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm, as you can appreciate, just not going to get into closed door discussions, but as you know and as we regularly read out, the Secretary has regular calls with Minister Gallant, and other folks from this building with their counterparts as well, so we're certainly in touch with the Israelis.\n\nBut we certainly do not support and have expressed our views on a major ground operation within Rafah.\n\nQ: So are you satisfied with what you're hearing about their humanitarian plan?\n\nMS. SINGH: I mean, again, I'm not going to get into private conversations. We want to see a - we want to see a concrete plan that will take into account the over one million people that are there right now. We don't support a large ground operation into Rafah.\n\nQ: Ms. Singh, I think Pat mentioned the security situation as one of the factors that could impact the timing (multiple speakers) Gaza. Has -- have the Israel strikes and sort of limited operation in Rafah changed your view of the security situation? Are you now more concerned about it, given what happened yesterday in Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: We're certainly taking into account the security consideration but still nothing has changed. We're still moving forward with the implementation of JLOTS. We do need these sea state conditions to steady. And until they do we're just not able to move that into that -- into the -- into it's location at this time. But of course the security situation is something that we're going to monitor and if that does impact anything when it comes to the JLOTS mission we would -- we would let you know.\n\nQ: I realize your policy you don't send any weapons to Israel has not changed, saying some shipments have been paused. What are the -- what message are you trying to send to Israel with those pause in shipments?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I don't have a -- I've seen those reports. I don't have a comment and I certainly wouldn't comment on specific cases or shipments. What I can reiterate is that our commitment to Israel security remains iron clad. You've seen that since October 7th. You've seen a surge security assistance to Israel. You've seen us come to the defense of Israel as recently as a few weeks ago when Iran launched attacks towards Israel.\n\nWe also were able to pass an emergency supplemental that surged additional security assistance to Israel. So while I'm not going to comment any further I can tell you that our commitments to Israel security remains the same.\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina.\n\nWere you given any heads up from your Israeli counterparts about this latest operation into Rafah? What is your understanding? You said we will not support the major operation. Is this part for major operation or limited? What is the information available to you?\n\nMS. SINGH: Our understanding is that this was a very limited operation designed to cut off Hamas' ability to smuggle more weapons and funding into Gaza. That is our understanding right now.\n\nThis just happened, I think, very early morning hours here. So we're monitoring the situation, we're in touch with our Israeli counterparts. We're going to see how this unfolds but I just don't have more for you to offer on like what this operation is other than that.\n\nQ: Can you -- according to UNRWA, this operation and -- and prior Israeli steps basically cut off all humanitarian aid into Gaza. All crossings are shutdown.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: OK, according to the UNRWA, this operation and prior Israeli steps basically cut off all humanitarian aid into Gaza. All crossings are shut down. Sadly, this one area, Rafah, obviously. You've been insisting, and the Secretary, in every read out that there should be an urgent increase in humanitarian aid. Is this operation and the closing of the Rafah crossing, meet your objectives in terms of your humanitarian situation in Gaza?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, we don't support the closing of these land routes. We want to see humanitarian aid to continue to get in. And so I think that was something that the president spoke to in his call with Prime Minister Netanyahu is that we do want to see these crossings open. Kerem Shalom has been closed for, I think, a bit now.\n\nSo we do want to see more aid be able to get through these crossing. That is a commitment that the Israeli government has made that they will. Again, we are -- we are continuing to monitor the situation on the ground.\n\nTo Lara's question earlier, we know land routes are the best, most effective, efficient way to get humanitarian aid in and we know that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. And so people need the medical supplies, the food, the water. That is something that we want to see continue to get in and we have been told that these crossings will open back up. In the meantime, you know, we've also continued to conduct humanitarian airdrops within Gaza. And should we get to the time and point where we're able to position this temporary pier off the coast of Gaza that will also help with humanitarian aid getting in. Warren.\n\nQ: A question on Rafah to follow up on Fadi's question. And then a question on the soldier in Russia.\n\nMS. SINGH: OK.\n\nQ: In the discussions about what you call the general broad overview of Israel's Rafah plans, was there discussion about this limited operation or was there no discussion about this previously with you between America and Israel?\n\nMS. SINGH: So we don't have more to share in terms of the conversation between Minister Gallant and Secretary Austin. But as you can appreciate, they talk pretty regularly. Their conversations are already -- are very direct, very frank with each other. But I'm just not going to go into more details on that.\n\nQ: Is this how soon Rafah could function again as one of the most important crossings?\n\nMS. SINGH: That would be something for the Israeli government to speak to. I can't speak to that.\n\nQ: And then a follow up question on Staff Sergeant Gordon Black. Is there any suspicion or concern that in his relationship with his Russian girlfriend or while in Russia he compromised sensitive information? And is that part of the ongoing investigation?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd refer you to Army for more information on that. As I mentioned, there is an administrative investigation underway to determine the facts, to determine what exactly happened here, the -- surrounding his travel. But I just don't have more thing on that.\n\nYes, Joe.\n\nQ: Thanks. The Biden administration is required to notify Congress by tomorrow if Israel violated the national law without humanitarian aid since October. Is it the department -- what's the department's assessment in terms of either one of those? Have they violated or had they without humanitarian aid?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I believe you're referring to the NSM? And that's something that I would have to refer you to State to speak to.\n\nQ: And has the Pentagon assessed that Israel has violated the international law or withheld humanitarian?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have anything to add on to this one. This is something that the State Department is putting together. It's a report to Congress that is, you know, due every -- however many increments. But I just don't have more at this time to offer on the NSM in particular.\n\nQ: That being said, human rights watch came out with a report and said, there was a March 27th attack on emergency and relief workers. And several of them in Southern Lebanon by Israel. And they say that a U.S. made JDAM was used, as well as a 500-pound Israeli bomb. It killed, like I said, at least several individuals who were civilians. And there's been no evidence of a military target at the site. Are you guys aware of this, how close -- I mean, we've seen -- you've said before that there are no conditions on U.S. military weapons provided -- or weapons provided to Israel. Are you guys tracking these kinds of things at all? And are you aware of this attack?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I'm not going to get into specific incidents. And I can't confirm those reports that you're citing U.S. weapons being used. What I can tell you is that we have been very clear that we want to see Israel comply with humanitarian laws and the laws of armed conflict. This is something that it's an interagency process that between the State Department, other agencies, we are reviewing. Our findings will also go into the NSM. For more on that. I'm just not going to get ahead of that process as you can appreciate. I'd refer you to the State Department.\n\nQ: The IKE has returned to the Red Sea. We saw a statement a couple -- I guess a couple weeks ago now that it had gone into the Sixth Fleet, into Europe. Can you say anything about -- and then, you know, on April 23rd, CENTCOM released the -- or put out a tweet and said there were F-16s deployed to AOR but didn't specify where. Can you say anything about -- can you give us any updates on this, I guess, mission to counter and deter the Houthis. Is the IKE -- has it been deployed -- has the deployment extended?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I don't have anything for you on any changes to our force posture with the Ike or anything additional. You have the positioning of our assets there for the exact reason to help with deterrence and our efforts when it comes to Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is to ensure that commercial shipping through the Red Sea, the BAM, the Gulf of Aden, can continue freely without the harassment of Houthi attacks.\n\nYou've seen CENTCOM put out, you know, regular updates on when there are engagements. But I don't have anything more to read out at this time on the IKE.\n\nLiz.\n\nQ: Last week, Secretary Austin told lawmakers, he was concerned over a \"lack of execution\" in terms of Israel's plans to evacuate civilians from Gaza. Is that still the case? Is he still concerned about the lack of execution?\n\nMS. SINGH: I think we are concerned about any type of ground operation, large ground operation within Rafah that does not take into account that very large civilian population. So yes, the Secretary's words still absolutely stand until today .\n\nQ: Follow up from Joseph's question. So was the USS IKE brought back into the Red Sea to counter the Houthis because there were increased attacks in the eastern event?\n\nMS. SINGH: Again, I don't have the list of attacks that happened when she was not in the Red Sea. But, you know, we have other partner nations that are part of Operation Prosperity Guardian and others that are not, that were engaging when the Houthis did fire attacks unlawfully at commercial vessels. I think I read out, you know, when she -- I said that she would be back soon. She has returned. But I just don't have more for you on anything additional or any extension. I'm just going to go to the phones before I forget and then come back into the room here. Jared Szuba, Al-Monitor.\n\nQ: Hi, Sabrina. Thanks for doing this. I understand that the Israeli officials told White House counterparts that last night's Rafah -- Operation Rahaf was limited. But what preparations are you seeing the Israeli military make? Does it look like they're setting up for broader ground clearing, major ground operations, or does it look like they're preparing for something more precise, and targeted, and surgical? Thanks.\n\nMS. SINGH: Thanks, Jared, for the question. So in terms of what they're doing, their actual planning when it comes to any operation, I would refer you to the IDF to speak to that. What I can tell you. And I'm not trying to sound like a broken record here, what I can tell you is publicly and privately, we've been very clear that we do not support a large ground incursion into Rafah, given the incredibly large civilian population that is currently sheltered there. And so, you know, I just have to reiterate that point again.\n\nAll right. Next question. J.J. Green WTOP.\n\nQ: Hey. Sabrina, thank you. Two quick questions about the Staff Sergeant Black. First one, can you address the significance of an active duty service member? Being in Russian custody, given Russia's efforts to, I guess, essentially seek out and find and capture Americans and to use them for political purposes or geopolitical purposes. Can you address the significance first of an active duty U.S. service member being in Russian custody?\n\nThanks, J.J. So before I start going down this line, I would just remind you that the Army is looking into this. They have an administrative investigation underway to determine the facts and circumstances around this travel.\n\nYou have to remember that, yes, this is an active duty service member, but he was on leave at the time. And so, you know, all we know is that he went to Russia for personal reasons. I don't have more to share as that -- is that the Army is continuing to look into this incident. And for further questions on his condition or next steps, I'd refer you to the State Department for more on that.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, did you have a follow-up?\n\nQ: You know, actually, I'll skip that, but thank you for answering that question.\n\nMS. SINGH: Of course. All right, I'll come back in the room. Yes, right over here?\n\nQ: Thank you, Sabrina. The ceasefire - sorry - the ceasefire proposal that Hamas has said - said they will accept, is this same offer that's been on the table for a long time? And have you reviewed it with your partners?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I would refer you to the State Department. And as you are probably aware, Bill Burns is in the region and sort of leading these negotiations. So I - I don't want to speak from here about the ceasefire or hostage negotiations that are taking place, other than that they are underway and, you know, we have a representative at the table as well working to see - to ensure that some - that a ceasefire could be put into place.\n\nIf a sea side - if - if a ceasefire were to be put into place, that obviously would increase chances of more humanitarian aid to get in to Gaza and of course release more hostages, which is obviously something we want to see.\n\nQ: On Russia - Vladimir Putin order his forces to rehearse for a non-strategic nuclear weapon. How do you look at it? And have you seen any change in Russia's posture on nuclear terms.\n\nMS. SINGH: How do we look at what Russia announced? We look at that as completely irresponsible. We have not seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture. We haven't seen any indications that Russia plans to use a nuclear weapon. But it's deeply irresponsible and we're going to continue to monitor what's happening in the region.\n\nYeah?\n\nQ: Sabrina, you've been saying for months now, this administration, that you're against a major military operation of Rafah.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: ... and they told around 100,000 people to evacuate in eastern Rafah, and that sounds like a lot of people. So what's the definition of a major military operation? What makes a limited military operation? What's a major military operation? Is there an acceptable number of civilians that can be put at greater risk for the Pentagon? Like, how - how do we know what's major?\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure. Look, I'm, as you can appreciate, not going to get into more specifics on, like, their operations and some of the things that they brief us on. A major military operation would put at risk civilian lives. Anything that puts at risk civilian lives within Rafah is something that we do - are not supportive of.\n\nWe do not want to see a population with over one million people who were, you know, directed there when other operations were going on in the north and the west, were forced into Rafah - we don't want to see the civilian population put at risk, knowing that also there is tremendous hurdles of also getting humanitarian aid in, medical supplies in.\n\nAnd so any type of a military operation must take into account that large concentration of civilians, and right now, we haven't seen a - we - we need to see a credible plan that would protect those civilians. And so we're continuing to urge and - and speak to our Israeli counterparts about that plan, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: You know, over 100,000 people were told to leave the area. That sounds like an alarming development because they can be put at greater risk. So this line that's drawn in the sand, how do you make sure that Israel doesn't cross that?\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah, again, I'm not putting a specific number on it, on, like, how many people or - need to leave or how many, you know - what a large-scale operation looks like cause I'm not going to detail their own plans and what they share with us. That's something for them to speak to.\n\nWhat I can tell you is we have a large population of civilians that are sheltered in Rafah. They need to be protected if there is any type of operation or any type of major ground incursion into Rafah. And we want to see those civilians protected. And to move over one million people, that's going to take a lot of time.\n\nSo we're - we're continuing to work with our Israeli counterparts, and I'll just leave it at that.\n\nYeah, in the back? Carla?\n\nQ: Thanks. I - VOA was told by a U.S. military official that - in Niger that some of the diplomatic clearances for flights have been denied. That's forced extended deployments. The day-to-day life sustainment is continuing very - via commercial contact - contract transportation. These raise a lot of questions.\n\nAnd what's going on with the U.S. forces in Niger right now? Are they allowed to leave? Are they getting the medical supplies and equipment and ammunition, et cetera, everything that they need? And why is - what reason is Niger giving the Pentagon for why they're denying some of the diplomatic clearances?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd direct you to the CNSP to speak to why they're denying some of the diplomatic clearances. We are working with the CNSP on what our orderly withdrawal looks like. As of right now, our forces in Niger still continue to have access to necessary food, water, medical supplies that they need, but this is of course something that we are working towards on what that orderly withdrawal looks like. There have been some cases where some of our service members have - have left Niger for unforeseen circumstances.\n\nRight now, as a - I think we briefed a few weeks ago, we will have another delegation led by someone from the Department of Defense that will go to Niamey to continue these conversations about the orderly withdrawal. That visit hasn't happened yet. So until that does and until parameters are put around for these negotiations on what the orderly withdrawal looks like, we're still in a bit of this holding pattern until we can have those conversations. Great.\n\nQ: Real quickly if I may on Russia? There have been requests for the Pentagon to kind of detail how Russia is able to use Starlink cause Starlink is also contracted with DOD. Do you have any details to provide on how Russia is able to use that on the battlefield, and what the Pentagon and others are doing to try to prevent that from happening?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have anything specific on Russia using Starlink. As you know, our - our contract with Starlink is for the Ukrainians to use, but I don't have anything more specific on Russia using Starlink.\n\nAnri.\n\nQ: Yeah, thanks so much. My question is about the South China Sea. Recently, we have seen the Chinese dangerous options towards Philippines vessels, but recently, Chinese government argued that there was a temporary special agreement with the former Philippine President Duterte in 2016 and - about the restricted access by Philippine vessels, and China accused the Philippines side of the recent tensions. So can I ask for your comment on this Chinese claim?\n\nMS. SINGH: Are you talking about, like, the firing of water cannons, things like that towards Philippine vessels?\n\nQ: Yes, and China claims that there was a hidden agreement with the Philippines side.\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not exactly clear, maybe not understanding about an agreement that you're referring to, but of course we continue to monitor what's happening in the South China Sea, we continue to be alarmed when these incidents happen, whether it be with Philippine vessels or other vessels. We want to be able to see the - you know, the - the freedom of navigation to be upheld. So of course we're going to continue to monitor what's happening there with our partners and allies.\n\nYeah?\n\nQ: Thank you. My question is about another country in Africa, Chad. Could you give me the update on the situation in Chad? Has the withdrawal of the - has the withdrawal of - withdrawal been completed or are there any U.S. personnel remaining in the country?\n\nMS. SINGH: Thanks for the question. So I actually don't have much of an update other than what we provided last week, which is that there were some military personnel that did leave the country. Some of which were already scheduled to rotate out.\n\nWe do still have military personnel in the country at the embassy, but I don't have more of an update for you on that other than that's basically where we were last week.\n\nQ: So the situation hasn't been changed because there was a presidential election yesterday. Yeah.\n\nMS. SINGH: today? Yeah. We're continuing our conversations with the government, but I just don't have more to share at this time. I'll come back in a sec. Let me just go. I have two more on the phones and then happy to come back in the room.\n\nHeather, USNI.\n\nQ: Thanks so much. So the Houthis have said that they're going to stop all ships that enter their operation or zone of operation in the Red Sea. So I have -- and as well as target ships that they can reach with any of their weapons, including in the Med.\n\nSo I have two questions. The first is if there's been any talk of updating the presence in the Red Sea in order to combat this latest threat. And then the second one, is there any concerns about -- or I guess, how is the U.S. prepared to protect ships that are going to be bringing in aid in the Med to the temporary appear from any potential Houthi attacks, considering that the Houthis might not recognize those as age ships versus commercial ships going towards Israel?\n\nMS. SINGH: Hey, thanks, Heather, for the question. I will be candid. I missed a bit of the first part. But in terms of age ships getting into to the Eastern Med, and you're talking about aid being transported from the floating pier to the causeway. As we have said before, we have assurances from the IDF that they would be providing security around that transport, so whether it's any attacks from any group, the IDF, of course, will be providing that security.\n\nIn terms of -- and apologies, I did miss a little bit of the first part of your question. In terms of any posture changes in the Red Sea, no posture changes. Again, Operation Prosperity Guardian is something that continues to work every single day in a coalition to ensure the freedom of navigation through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. I don't have any posture changes to announce today from the podium.\n\nOK. And the last question from the phone. I'm happy to come back in the room. Jeff Schogol, Task & Purpose.\n\nQ: Thank you. I understand the Army has launched an administrative investigation into Staff Sergeant Black. I'm just curious, does DOD have any indications that he may have been lured to Russia as part of an effort by Russian intelligence to detain him?\n\nMS. SINGH: Jeff, appreciate the question. This is something that the Army is looking into, which is why they've been -- they've launched an investigation to determine the facts and the circumstances of his travel. And I just don't have anything more to add at this time.\n\nHappy to come back in the room. OK. We'll do two more. Three more.\n\nQ: Some media is showing pictures that General Kurilla is in Egypt.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: Can you tell us what he's doing there? And if he has any other schedule events?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'd refer you to CENTCOM for more details. I don't have more on his travel. He does, you know, regularly travel to the region. I think he was there, if not last week, the week before. But I don't know his other schedule stops. But CENTCOM would be able to provide that information.\n\nQ: We know any part of Director Burns travel to the Egypt today?\n\nMS. SINGH: Not to my awareness. No. Fadi and then Erin.\n\nQ: Sabrina, my question about this Israeli invasion of Rafah, you said it's -- your understanding, this is a limited operation it aims to -- or at cutting off Hamas' capabilities or ability to smuggle weapons and money. However, the process of bringing humanitarian aid through Rafah is controlled by both Egypt and Israel. And Israelis do screen shipments before they get into Rafah.\n\nWere you presented by any information from Israel that proves that still Hamas has the ability to smuggle weapons and money to Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: So Fadi, as -- yeah.\n\nQ: And I just want to note that international organizations, including the U.N., and humanitarian, and NGOs have been complaining about Israel measures that are delaying the entry of humanitarian aid to Rafah through their screening and other steps.\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, I think we've also been very public in our --\n\nMS. SINGH: Let me just finish. So we've been very public and called from this podium from other podiums across, you know, the interagency that we want to see more humanitarian aid get into Gaza. It was directed by the President that we setup a maritime corridor to surge aid in because not enough is getting in. So we also are concerned with how much aid is getting in to Gaza. And that's also why you've seen CENTCOM take the measures that they have to do these airdrops. So I just -- I appreciate the question, but I think also you have to remember that this government has been calling for it repeatedly. We want to see more.\n\nTo your question on Hamas and being able to smuggle weapons, unfortunately, I just can't speak to the intelligence on that. But what I can tell you is that we're continuing to monitor the situation on the ground. We've been very clear about any type of large scale incursion into Rafah. And we know, we know how large that population is down there. And we know how dire the humanitarian situation is. So we do not want to see a large scale ground incursion into Rafah.\n\nAgain, we're continuing to monitor what's happening on the ground. It's just happened earlier, you know, early hours this morning. So I just don't have more to share this time. Sure.\n\nQ: So I understand. And your point of this is well-taken. I'm not talking about the U.S. government effort to bring in more aid or complaining about.\n\nMS. SINGH: Sure.\n\nQ: But this shows the contradiction, which is to say Israel is in control of what loads or does not flow into Gaza without controlling Rafah where they actually had that incursion or invasion. So are you taking what the Israelis are providing you at face value in terms of the aim of this operation is to cut off, the ability to smuggle weapons and money? Or are you going to actually look into those allegations?\n\nWe believe what they are saying that this was a limited operation, that it was to cut off the movement, the traffic of weapons into Gaza through the Rafah crossing. But again, it's something that we're going to continue to monitor. This just happened earlier, you know, a few hours ago, so let us continue to monitor what's happening on the ground.\n\nErin, last question.\n\nQ: Yes. With Israel, you keep using the word ironclad. But now, how is it such an ironclad relationship when we have -- we're expected to delay the shipments of munitions there? So what makes it so ironclad now that we're delaying shipments?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, what makes it ironclad, Erin, is since October 7th, you've seen this government surge humanitarian security assistance and humanitarian support to Israel. So let me just finish. So you've seen us continue to support Israel. I don't need to remind you of the attack that happened a few weeks ago on Israel from Iran where the U.S. partnered with Israel and other coalition forces to defeat that attack.\n\nAgain, I don't have a comment on specific cases or shipments. But what I can tell you is through our actions and through what you've seen since October 7th, that's what we mean when our commitment to Israel and other coalition forces to defeat that attack. Again, I don't have a comment on specific cases or shipments.\n\nBut what I can tell you is through our actions and through what you've seen since October 7th, that's what we mean when our commitment to Israel is ironclad because we continue to stand by our partner and ally in their fight against a terrorist organization who continues to use civilians as human shields. But we also have hard conversations with our friends. And that's what you continue to see the Secretary do at his level and others across this -- across the interagency do as well.\n\nQ: So yesterday morning with General Ryder, he stated that we had not seen a detailed plan about Rafah. Had we seen any plan prior to them entering Rafah?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, as I mentioned in a few weeks ago, there was a delegation that was here that, you know, briefed us broadly on their plans for Rafah. We have continued to engage the Israelis. And I think there was a readout at that time from the White House and some of those meetings. We're continuing to engage our Israeli counterparts. I just don't have more to share on their plans.\n\nQ: Not a delegation, but yesterday before they entered, did we know that they were going to go -- had they talked to Secretary Austin prior to entering a couple hours before?\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah, I think I answered that. I think Oren -- asked that question. Look, I'm just not going to get into private -- more details on the private conversations between Secretary Austin and Minister Gallant. Those conversations do happen often. They're frank. They're very direct. And I'll just leave it at that.\n\nQ: They're listening to Secretary Austin?\n\nMS. SINGH: I do. I do actually think that. And the reason why is because since the beginning, we have seen the Israelis, the IDF make decisions that have been influenced and impacted by conversations with the secretary and other people across this department and the agent -- the interagency. So yes, we do feel like they are listening.", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of Defense"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One floating pier will be deployed several miles offshore outside Gaza, while the other, called the Trident pier, or \"causeway,\" will be pushed onto and attached to the Gazan shore. Together they will be used to move humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nBoth of the floating piers, along with the MV Roy P. Benavidez -- a large, medium-speed, roll-on, roll-off ship -- are off the coast of Israel near the Port of Ashdod, about 18 miles north of Gaza. Unfavorable sea conditions prevent movement of the piers to their final location.\n\nIn the meantime, the MV Sagamore -- a commercial cargo ship -- has been loaded with humanitarian aid in Cyprus and has made its way to Ashdod. Instead of waiting for the piers to be deployed, humanitarian aid on the Sagamore will be moved to the Benavidez so that the Sagamore can go back to Cyprus to get more aid supplies, said Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\n\"In this period of time that we have before the pier becomes operational, we're essentially using that time to get ahead,\" Ryder said during a briefing today. \"Since the Sagamore has been loaded with humanitarian assistance, by transloading that on to the Benavidez, the Benavidez is essentially in position to immediately start loading that onto the floating pier for subsequent shipment to the causeway and delivery to the shore.\"\n\nBecause the Benavidez will remain near Gaza when the humanitarian mission begins, Ryder said, the Sagamore is free to go back to Cyprus to get additional aid.\n\nOnce the two floating piers are deployed, ships loaded with humanitarian aid will dock at the floating pier off the coast of Gaza and have their cargo unloaded onto trucks that are onboard Army-owned landing craft utility ships, or LCUs, and logistic support vessels, or LSVs.\n\nThe Army ships will then travel toward Gaza where they will meet up with the Trident pier. There, the trucks onboard the LCUs and LSVs will drive onto the pier and onto the shore of Gaza where the humanitarian aid supplies can then be staged for delivery inside Gaza. Ryder said non-U.S. civilian contractors will be responsible for driving those vehicles.\n\nIt's expected that initially about 90 truckloads of supplies will transit the causeway each day and make their way into Gaza. When the operation reaches full capacity, as many as 150 trucks will make their way into Gaza daily.\n\n\"This is a complex operation which requires close coordination with many partners,\" said Ryder. \"The United States is joining an international community-backed effort, led by [U.S. Agency for International Development] with support from the United Nations, the World Food Programme, the Republic of Cyprus, other partner nations and the [Israeli Defense Forces] to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance via a maritime corridor to the people of Gaza.\"", "source": {"uri":

Daniel Hagari was asked at a news conference whether the army can conduct the operation without U.S. arms.\n\n\"The army has armaments for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah too -- we have what we need,\" Hagari said.\n\nHagari spoke after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah -- the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza -- over concerns for the civilians there.\n\nHagari said relations with the U.S. remain close, and that disagreements should be resolved behind closed doors.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nhe first aid ship bound for an American-built floating pier to be installed in Gaza departed early Thursday. But it's unclear when the corridor will be up and running, and humanitarian groups say there are still major obstacles to getting food to starving Palestinians in the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nCyprus announced the ship's departure even though the U.S. military has not yet installed the pier and questions remain as to how the aid will be distributed. Even when the route is up and running, it won't be able to handle as much aid as Gaza's two main land crossings, which are currently inaccessible.\n\nThe U.N. says most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians suffer from hunger and that northern Gaza is already experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nHumanitarian workers fear an even more dire situation if Israel launches a long-promised invasion of the southern city of Rafah, which is the main distribution point for aid and where some 1.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge, most having fled from fighting elsewhere.\n\nIsrael seized the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, and it's unclear when it will reopen. Israel reopened its side of the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing -- Gaza's main cargo terminal -- after a rocket attack over the weekend, but the U.N.'s main provider of humanitarian assistance says aid cannot be brought in on the Palestinian side because of the security situation.\n\nA recently reopened route in the north is still functioning, but only 60 trucks entered on Tuesday, far below the 500 that entered Gaza each day before the war.\n\nInternational aid groups warned this week that a distribution network is at risk of collapse across the territory because of the closure of Rafah, which was used to import fuel. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it only has enough stocks to maintain operations for a few days and has started rationing.\n\nThe threat of a full-scale invasion of Rafah, where many aid groups have warehouses and staff, is also disrupting distribution.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that the United States would not supply offensive weapons for an all-out invasion, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two close allies.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu brushed off the threat in a statement issued Thursday, saying \"If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone.\"\n\n\"If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote a post on the platform X with a heart between the words \"Hamas\" and \"Biden.\" He and other ultra-nationalist members of Netanyahu's coalition support a large-scale Rafah operation and have threatened to bring down his government if it doesn't happen.\n\nIsrael's limited military incursion into Rafah has meanwhile already complicated what had been months of efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt to broker a cease-fire and the release of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nCIA Director William Burns headed back to the United States as planned on Thursday after attending talks in Cairo and meeting with Netanyahu this week, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door international efforts.\n\nHamas also said its delegation had left Cairo and was returning to Qatar, where it maintains a political office.\n\nEgypt's state-owned Al-Qahera TV said that the Cairo negotiations were continuing. It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nThe war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with U.S.-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nBiden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMaj. Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favorable seas before being moved into position off Gaza.

But it's unclear when the corridor will be up and running, and humanitarian groups say there are still major obstacles to getting food to starving Palestinians in the war-ravaged enclave. Cyprus announced the ship's departure even though the U.S. military has not yet installed the pier and questions remain as to how the aid will be distributed. Even when the route is up and running, it won't be able to handle as much aid as Gaza's two main land crossings, which are currently inaccessible. The U.N. says most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians suffer from hunger and that northern Gaza is already experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\u009d Humanitarian workers fear an even more dire situation if Israel launches a long-promised invasion of the southern city of Rafah, which is the main distribution point for aid and where some 1.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge, most having fled from fighting elsewhere. Israel seized the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, and it's unclear when it will reopen. Israel reopened its side of the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing - Gaza's main cargo terminal - after a rocket attack over the weekend, but the U.N.'s main provider of humanitarian assistance says aid cannot be brought in on the Palestinian side because of the security situation. A recently reopened route in the north is still functioning, but only 60 trucks entered on Tuesday, far below the 500 that entered Gaza each day before the war. International aid groups warned this week that a distribution network is at risk of collapse across the territory because of the closure of Rafah, which was used to import fuel. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it only has enough stocks to maintain operations for a few days and has started rationing. The threat of a full-scale invasion of Rafah, where many aid groups have warehouses and staff, is also disrupting distribution. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the United States would not supply offensive weapons for an all-out invasion, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two close allies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu brushed off the threat in a statement issued Thursday, saying \"If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone.\" \"If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails,\"\u009d he added. Earlier, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote a post on the platform X with a heart between the words \"Hamas\"\u009d and \"Biden.\"\u009d He and other ultra-nationalist members of Netanyahu's coalition support a large-scale Rafah operation and have threatened to bring down his government if it doesn't happen. Israel's limited military incursion into Rafah has meanwhile already complicated what had been months of efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt to broker a cease-fire and the release of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. CIA Director William Burns headed back to the United States as planned on Thursday after attending talks in Cairo and meeting with Netanyahu this week, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door international efforts. Hamas also said its delegation had left Cairo and was returning to Qatar, where it maintains a political office. Egypt's state-owned Al-Qahera TV said that the Cairo negotiations were continuing. It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government. The war began with Hamas' surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with U.S.-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes. Biden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza. Maj. Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favorable seas before being moved into position off Gaza. He said the U.S. vessel Sagamore, which left Cyprus, would transport aid to another ship, the Roy P. Benavidez, which is off the coast of Gaza. \"In the coming days, the U.S. will commence an international community-backed effort to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza using a floating pier,\" he said. ___ Hadjicostis reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.

The best way[s] are through [...] land routes, and we do want to see those opened up,\" Singh said.\n\nThe Amalthea route is intended to augment ways that aid can get in, the US official noted, through land routes as well as regular airdrops.\n\nA slow beginning is expected which will gradually ramp up, she said.\n\n\"Initially a small amount of aid trucks [will be deployed] to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase [...] when we get to full operational capacity,\" she said.\n\nThe last humanitarian aid shipment from Cyprus to Gaza aboard the Jennifer, landed at the Israeli port of Ashdod on April 28.\n\nNews website Reuters reported that the jetty cost a total of $320 million (\u20ac298m) to construct, and that around 1,000 US army and navy servicepeople had been involved in its construction.\n\nIt's potential placement has also been a cause for concern among some quarters, with British newspaper The Guardian having reported that it may be too far south to help alleviate the famine in the northern Gaza.\n\nMore than 1.5 million people have been crowded into the narrow strip of land which has been effectively cut off from the rest of Gaza by a military road constructed by the Israeli Defence Force linking Israel to the coast, known as the Netzarim corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that the US paused shipment of 3,000 bombs to Israel in an attempt to head off a full-scale invasion of Rafah.\n\nIsraeli forces on Tuesday seized control of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt and tanks pushed into the southern Gazan city cutting of the vital aid route, as international mediators struggle to find agreement on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.", "source": {"uri":

Rough surface conditions forced the operation to temporarily relocate to sheltered water at the Port of Ashdod, but the water-side preparatory work is now complete.\n\nThe complex operation will draw on the Joint Logistics Over The Shore capability, an Army/Navy/civilian mariner system that marries sealift with temporary port infrastructure. By setting up and using the JLOTS system, the 1,000-person team will be able to transfer food aid from a commercial sealift vessel onto a moored receiving barge out at sea; transfer the cargo onto U.S. Army landing craft; ferry the goods to a mile-long floating causeway, or \"trident pier\"; and then truck the food to a nearby distribution hub. The shoreside elements of the operation will not involve American servicemembers at any point, according to the White House.\n\n\"As of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS -- the floating pier and the Trident pier -- are complete and awaiting final movement offshore,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Tuesday.\n\nA U.S.-flagged geared freighter, the Sagamore, is already in Cyprus loading food aid for the first shipment. Sagamore will unload her cargo directly onto Army trucks at the floating pier, and the trucks will carry it the rest of the way via the JLOTS infrastructure. It will not be a pure ro/ro operation, though JLOTS is capable of compatibility with ro/ro sealift.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the system will be capable of handling 150 truckloads of food a day - though it may take a while to get up to speed. \"I think what you're going to see at the very beginning is a 'crawl, walk, run' scenario,\" Singh said. \"We're going to start with an additional small amount of aid trucks to flow in to make sure that the system works, that the distribution works, and then you'll see that increase ... when we get to full operational capacity.\"\n\nSingh acknowledged a common criticism of the maritime aid corridor - that it does not have the capacity to handle Gaza's full needs. She said that cross-border trucking would be preferable, but that the maritime corridor would still help.\n\nThe territory used to get about 500 trucks a day of food aid, but the flow has been repeatedly interrupted by Israeli border controls over the past seven months. The UN says that northern Gaza is now in a state of \"full-blown famine.\" While flows temporarily increased after unprecedented pressure from the White House, the quantities remain below the level necessary to prevent mass starvation. On Tuesday, Israel's military forces seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, temporarily shutting down one of the most important routes for aid trucks.\n\nIsrael's military leadership described a policy of restricting food shipments to Gaza at the outset of the conflict, and the UN's human rights chief has suggested that this decision might be interpreted as an act of using food as a weapon of war. The International Criminal Court is widely believed to be weighing charges against both the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas and against Israeli leadership - prompting an outcry from Israel's political allies in the United States.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime Executive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealift", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sealift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Navy_Govt_CoastGuard/JLOTS-trident-pier-Gaza-Central-Command.8dffb7.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547153", "eventUri": "eng-9547153", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

But it's unclear when the corridor will be up and running, and humanitarian groups say there are still major obstacles to getting food to starving Palestinians in the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nCyprus announced the ship's departure even though the U.S. military has not yet installed the pier and questions remain as to how the aid will be distributed. Even when the route is up and running, it won't be able to handle as much aid as Gaza's two main land crossings, which are currently inaccessible.\n\nThe U.N. says most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians suffer from hunger and that northern Gaza is already experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nHumanitarian workers fear an even more dire situation if Israel launches a long-promised invasion of the southern city of Rafah, which is the main distribution point for aid and where some 1.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge, most having fled from fighting elsewhere.\n\nIsrael seized the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, and it's unclear when it will reopen. Israel reopened its side of the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing -- Gaza's main cargo terminal -- after a rocket attack over the weekend, but the U.N.'s main provider of humanitarian assistance says aid cannot be brought in on the Palestinian side because of the security situation.\n\nA recently reopened route in the north is still functioning, but only 60 trucks entered on Tuesday, far below the 500 that entered Gaza each day before the war.\n\nInternational aid groups warned this week that a distribution network is at risk of collapse across the territory because of the closure of Rafah, which was used to import fuel. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it only has enough stocks to maintain operations for a few days and has started rationing.\n\nThe threat of a full-scale invasion of Rafah, where many aid groups have warehouses and staff, is also disrupting distribution.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that the United States would not supply offensive weapons for an all-out invasion, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two close allies.\n\nThere was no official response to the move from Israel, but the country's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote a post on the platform X with a heart between the words \"Hamas\" and \"Biden.\" He and other ultra-nationalist members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition support a large-scale Rafah operation and have threatened to bring down his government if it doesn't happen.\n\nIsrael's limited military incursion into Rafah has meanwhile already complicated what had been months of efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt to broker a cease-fire and the release of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nCIA Director William Burns headed back to the United States as planned on Thursday after attending talks in Cairo and meeting with Netanyahu this week, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door international efforts.\n\nHamas also said its delegation had left Cairo and was returning to Qatar, where it maintains a political office.\n\nEgypt's state-owned Al-Qahera TV said that the Cairo negotiations were continuing. It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The group is still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nThe war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with U.S.-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nBiden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMaj.

It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas's surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a ceasefire last year.\n\nThe war has killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with US-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nMr Biden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMajor Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favourable seas before being moved into position off Gaza.

We have lots of fishing piers at the Jersey Shore, but this one is the longest I've seen here in the Garden State.\n\nThis fishing pier is the longest in New Jersey, spanning over a thousand feet, according to onlyinyourstate.com. When I checked it out, it was something I would expect to see in Florida or North Carolina.\n\nYou can take a walk on this pier all year long, it's open at all times and right now might be the perfect time to check it out. It's chilly, so maybe the pier will be empty, you could have it all to yourself.\n\nThe views are just amazing. The longest fishing pier in New Jersey is in Ventnor City.

But it's unclear when the corridor will be up and running, and humanitarian groups say there are still major obstacles to getting food to starving Palestinians in the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nCyprus announced the ship's departure even though the U.S. military has not yet installed the pier and questions remain as to how the aid will be distributed. Even when the route is up and running, it won't be able to handle as much aid as Gaza's two main land crossings, which are currently inaccessible.\n\nThe U.N. says most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians suffer from hunger and that northern Gaza is already experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nHumanitarian workers fear an even more dire situation if Israel launches a long-promised invasion of the southern city of Rafah, which is the main distribution point for aid and where some 1.3 million Palestinians have sought refuge, most having fled from fighting elsewhere.\n\nIsrael seized the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, and it's unclear when it will reopen. Israel reopened its side of the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing -- Gaza's main cargo terminal -- after a rocket attack over the weekend, but the U.N.'s main provider of humanitarian assistance says aid cannot be brought in on the Palestinian side because of the security situation.\n\nA recently reopened route in the north is still functioning, but only 60 trucks entered on Tuesday, far below the 500 that entered Gaza each day before the war.\n\nInternational aid groups warned this week that a distribution network is at risk of collapse across the territory because of the closure of Rafah, which was used to import fuel. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it only has enough stocks to maintain operations for a few days and has started rationing.\n\nThe threat of a full-scale invasion of Rafah, where many aid groups have warehouses and staff, is also disrupting distribution.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Wednesday that the United States would not supply offensive weapons for an all-out invasion, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two close allies.\n\nThere was no official response to the move from Israel, but the country's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote a post on the platform X with a heart between the words \"Hamas\" and \"Biden.\" He and other ultra-nationalist members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition support a large-scale Rafah operation and have threatened to bring down his government if it doesn't happen.\n\nIsrael's limited military incursion into Rafah has meanwhile already complicated what had been months of efforts by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt to broker a cease-fire and the release of hostages captured in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.\n\nCIA Director William Burns headed back to the United States as planned on Thursday after attending talks in Cairo and meeting with Netanyahu this week, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door international efforts.\n\nHamas also said its delegation had left Cairo and was returning to Qatar, where it maintains a political office.\n\nEgypt's state-owned Al-Qahera TV said that the Cairo negotiations were continuing. It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year.\n\nThe war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with U.S.-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nBiden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMaj. Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favorable seas before being moved into position off Gaza. He said the U.S. vessel Sagamore, which left Cyprus, would transport aid to another ship, the Roy P. Benavidez, which is off the coast of Gaza.\n\n\"In the coming days, the U.S. will commence an international community-backed effort to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza using a floating pier,\" he said.\n\nHadjicostis reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.

It did not say whether Israel's delegation was still there, and there was no comment from the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began with Hamas's surprise attack into southern Israel, in which it killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage. The militants are still holding some 100 captives and the remains of more than 30 after most of the rest were released during a ceasefire last year.\n\nThe war has killed more than 34,800 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's offensive, waged with US-supplied munitions, has caused widespread devastation and forced some 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes.\n\nMr Biden announced the construction of the floating pier two months ago as part of efforts to ramp up humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nMajor Pete Nguyen, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday that parts of the pier are still in the Israeli port of Ashdod awaiting more favourable seas before being moved into position off Gaza. He said the US vessel Sagamore, which left Cyprus, would transport aid to another ship, which is off the coast of Gaza.\n\n\"In the coming days, the US will commence an international community-backed effort to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza using a floating pier,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultranationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom_border_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom border crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rationing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

People run on the pier, they fish, and they take in the view.\n\nThe damaged portion of the pier, known as the 'hammerhead,' is where the old Ruby's Diner was located.\n\nOfficials expect the clean-up and rebuilding process will take quite a while.\n\n\"The visual I saw [the day of the fire] I was fearful we were going to lose 25-30 percent of the pier,\" said Deputy Fire Chief Jessamyn Specht. \"So to come out here less than three weeks later and see that we saved 93 percent of the pier and we're ready to reopen tomorrow morning, it gives me a pretty good sense of accomplishment and a lot of pride in my fire department for the work that we did.\"\n\nAccording to fire investigators, the cause is believed to be accidental. They suspect the fire may have started underneath the pier. City officials have been talking with officials in Seal Beach, where a similar fire happened at the end of that pier back in 2016, also in a vacant Ruby's Diner. The cause of that fire was electrical. Rebuilding the structure took three years.\n\nThursday several people stopped to take pictures of the Oceanside Pier. Dennis and Susan Smith, visiting from Vista, said they were surprised to find out the pier is reopening as quickly as it is.\n\n\"I come down and fish a lot, it'll be nice to bring my granddaughter down and fish,\" said Dennis Smith.\n\n\"It'll be good just to see people back on the pier again. It's funny walking down here and not seeing anybody on the pier,\" said Susan Smith.", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cbs8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanside_Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceanside Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanside,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceanside, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oceanside, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby's_Diner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruby's Diner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seal Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seal Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.cbs8.com/assets/KFMB/images/0da5820f-d9e3-4d60-a51a-35d39467f18d/20240509T194830/0da5820f-d9e3-4d60-a51a-35d39467f18d_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547153", "eventUri": "eng-9547153", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oceanside, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

But the system had to be moved to the Port of Ashdod last week due to heavy seas, and it still hasn't left.\n\nEven when JLOTS becomes operational, the weather and sea conditions may severely limit the ability to use the floating pier.\n\nIt can only be safely operated in conditions with a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour, according to a 2006 Naval War College paper on the systems limitations. A prediction of sea conditions from Israel's Marine Data Center shows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit in the area.\n\n\"JLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,\" the authors wrote.\n\nA defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on the pier system are accurate.\n\n\"The bottom line - heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,\" the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous.\n\nAnother potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported.\n\nThe US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation \"in the coming days,\" a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez.\n\nThe Benavidez, contracted by the US military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort.\n\nThe US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the Biden administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not \"currently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.\"\n\nAnother diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of \"a host of contingency plans\" that had been developed.\n\n\"But for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,\" the source added \"The most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.\"\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that \"non-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.\"\n\nOne plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF's history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF's control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A prediction of sea conditions from Israel's Marine Data Center shows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit in the area.\n\n\"JLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,\" the authors wrote.\n\nA defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on the pier system are accurate.\n\n\"The bottom line - heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,\" the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous.\n\nAnother potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported.\n\nThe US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation \"in the coming days,\" a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez.\n\nThe Benavidez, contracted by the US military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort.\n\nThe US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter.\n\nThe UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the Biden administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not \"currently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.\"\n\nAnother diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of \"a host of contingency plans\" that had been developed.\n\n\"But for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,\" the source added \"The most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.\"\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that \"non-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.\"\n\nOne plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF's history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF's control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Gen. Pat Ryder Holds a Press Briefing", "body": "MAJOR GENERAL PAT RYDER: All right, well, good afternoon, everyone. Just a few things -- thank you, sir -- just a few things at the top and then that'll get right to your questions.\n\nFirst, let me start with a brief update on the status of the Joint Logistics Over-The-Shore capability, or JLOTS, that we're establishing in support of humanitarian assistance efforts with USAID and other partners. As my colleague Sabrina Singh briefed on Tuesday, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS system, both the floating pier and the Trident pier, or causeway, have been completed and are currently positioned offshore at the Port of Ashdod awaiting final movement.\n\nWhile I'm not going to provide a specific date, we expect these temporary piers to be put into position in the very near future, pending suitable security and weather conditions. In the meantime, the motor vessel Sagamore departed Cyprus today loaded with humanitarian aid for transloading onto the motor vessel Roy P. Benavidez, which is currently off the coast of Ashdod, to begin the process of staging humanitarian aid.\n\nNow, once the floating pier and the Trident pier are in position, this will allow for the Benavidez to transload -- load the aid to logistics support vessels and delivery while the motor vessel Sagamore is back in Cyprus to enable loading of additional aid.\n\nAnd as you are aware, this is a complex operation which requires close coordination with many partners. The United States is joining an international community-backed effort led by USAID, with support from the United Nations, the World Food Program, the Republic of Cyprus, other partner nations, and the IDF to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance via a maritime corridor to the people of Gaza.\n\nWe're grateful for the continued partnership and cooperation of all involved in this important effort, and we'll be sure to keep you updated as the JLOTS system becomes operational.\n\nSwitching gears, Secretary Austin hosted German Federal Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius today here in the Pentagon for a bilateral meeting to discuss ongoing efforts to support Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression.\n\nThe two leaders also exchanged views on the upcoming 75th anniversary NATO Washington Summit in July and addressed broader security issues, to include challenges in the Indo-Pacific region and our nation's mutual commitment to global stability and NATO's strategic goals. A full readout from the meeting will be posted to the DOD website later today.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Minister Pistorius, Secretary Austin departed the Pentagon to travel to South Carolina, where he'll deliver the commencement address at South Carolina State university tomorrow. He'll also visit Fort Jackson to meet with troops, swear in some of our newest recruits joining the U.S. military, and see the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course.\n\nAnd finally, after joining NATO last year, Finland forged a new tie with the Department of Defense when they signed their formal state partnership agreement with the Virginia National Guard at a ceremony in Helsinki on May 2nd.\n\nWhile only recently formalized, the partnership between Finland and the Virginia Guard goes back to 2001, when the 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia Army Guard deployed with Finnish Defense Forces as part of Stabilization Force 10 in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nThe National Guard's state partnership program now includes 89 partnerships with 106 nations around the globe. And I would encourage you to reach out to National Guard Bureau for more information.\n\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions. We'll start off with Associated Press, Tara.\n\nQ: Thanks, General Ryder. First on Rafah and then a second topic. The President yesterday said that depending on what happens in Rafah, he may also pause potentially artillery and weapons shipments to Israel. And a senior administration official said earlier this week that JDAM kits were possibly under consideration as something else that might be paused.\n\nCan you give us an update on these shipments? The -- one, the 2,000 pound and 500 pound bombs that are already paused? And whether the Pentagon has received any request to pause additional weapons shipments?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. First, you know, let me -- let me just say up front, Tara, that, as you heard both Secretary Austin and the President say, our commitment to Israel's inherent right to self-defense remains ironclad. And as you know, we've provided billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel. We've supported their efforts to defend themselves, most recently Iran's unprecedented attack. So there should be no question that we will continue to stand by Israel when it comes to their defense.\n\nAlso, as Secretary Austin and the President highlighted yesterday, we're currently reviewing some near-term security assistance. Specifically, we paused one shipment of weapons consisting of 1,800 2,000 pound bombs and 1,700 500 pound bombs.\n\nWe've not made a final determination on how to proceed with this shipment, and, you know, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. Again, we've been very clear on our views as it relates to Rafah and any ground operations there, and I'll just leave it there.\n\nQ: What would, I guess, determine your final decision on whether to send weapons? What do you need from Israel in order to send them weapons or to determine that you're not sending weapons?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I'm not -- again, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. As I mentioned, we've -- we have paused one shipment. And of course, we're continuing to discuss with Israeli officials, you know, their plans as it relates to Rafah and addressing the Hamas threat.\n\nQ: OK. And then a separate topic. On Friday, a Florida sheriff's deputy shot and killed senior airman Roger Fortson. He was in his own off-base apartment. The -- the deputy entered the apartment and shot and killed him. Has Secretary Austin been following this? Is he concerned at all? Has he reached out to the family? And are there any kind of greater concerns about all of the military personnel that live in off-base housing when you have law enforcement coming, responding to a call?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Well, first of all, the -- the Secretary is following this closely. And -- and I would like to offer our thoughts and prayers to airman Fortson's family. We are of course saddened at the loss of one of our own.\n\nI know that his death is currently under investigation, so I'll -- I'll have to refer you to the Florida civil authorities for any questions about what happened, but we do know that his family is grieving and we offer our sincere condolences.\n\nQ: Pat, a little more detail on the pier. You said the Sagamore is underway, it'll load onto the Benavidez, and then the Benavidez will load onto smaller ships. Is that -- can you ...\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, so the way to think of this, Tom -- sure. The way to think of this is in this period of time that we have before the pier becomes operational, we're -- we're essentially using that time to get ahead. And since the Sagamore has been loaded with humanitarian assistance, by transloading that onto the Benavidez, the Benavidez is essentially in position to immediately start loading that onto the floating pier for subsequent shipment to the causeway and delivery to the shore.\n\nSince the Benavidez will be on the scene, so to speak, the day we pull the trigger and -- and start operations, that then frees up the Sagamore to go back to Cyprus to load up with additional aid. And then once this process gets going, the way to think of this is you'll have that floating pier several miles off-shore, ships will go directly from Cyprus to the floating pier to -- to unload.\n\nBut because we're, again, waiting for the appropriate security and weather conditions to kick this off, we're going to use that time to our advantage to move forward.\n\nQ: So the Benavidez will unload onto the pier itself?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Correct.\n\nQ: And then do we know who will be driving the trucks along the causeway to the beach?\n\nGEN. RYDER: So, there will be non-U.S. civilian contractors that will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.\n\nYeah. Bill?\n\nQ: Real quick on the Benavidez and all that. Is that going to be the regular rhythm for you all or is that just what you're going to do to prime the pump ...\n\nGEN. RYDER: That's just priming the pump, right? So, yeah. Yeah. So essentially after that, what will happen is the floating pier will be available for vessels to docket, to transload onto the logistic support field vessels. And so, you know, it could be the Benavidez, it could be the Sagamore, it could be other ships, again, that are picking up aid in Cyprus and bringing it to that floating pier.\n\nQ: And then, on the pause and some munitions, you know, could you explain a little bit about, you know, why those munitions were paused? And give us a sense, if you could, if Israel's trying to attack, you know, underground facilities used by Hamas, why those wouldn't be appropriate for that mission.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, again, you know, as we assess the situation in Rafah, we made the decision to pause this one shipment. Again, as I highlighted, a final determination has not been made on how to proceed with that shipment.\n\nBut specifically, we're focused on the end use, especially rather focused on the end use of the 2,000-pound bombs and the impact that they could have in a dense urban setting as we've seen in other parts of Gaza. So, that's something that we'll continue to look at.\n\nNow, again, looking at the broader context of the U.S.-Israel relationship, as I highlighted, we're going to continue to support Israel and its defensive needs in terms of the capabilities they need to defend himself. So again, we're talking about one shipment consisting of those 2,000 pounds and 500-pound bombs. Thanks.\n\nQ: Gen. Pat, just quickly on the 2,000-pound bombs, can you say the last time there was a shipment of the 2000-pound bombs to Israel?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I don't have that information to provide, Tom.\n\nQ: So, yesterday, the President acknowledged that Palestinian civilians have been killed by U.S.-provided weapons. Do you have a number of how many or assessment of how many civilians were killed by these weapons? And does the Secretary feel any moral obligation to kind of make that assessment?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I don't have a number, Fadi. Again, as we've said from the beginning, the loss of any innocent lives in this conflict are tragic. We've been very clear from the start with our Israeli partners that we expect that they will employ any capabilities we provide them in accordance with the law of armed conflict and international humanitarian law. And that has been a consistent and steady conversation that we've had from -- with them from the beginning, and it continues to now.\n\nSo again, as they contemplate how they will approach Hamas and Rafah, we certainly have provided our thoughts in how to best do that to take civilian safety and humanitarian assistance into account. And we'll continue to have those conversations.\n\nQ: You're talking about expectations. However, as you just mentioned before that one of the consideration about the 2,000-pound bombs is the density of the population in Rafah and how they were used before in other location by Israel. Why didn't you restrict before the use of these bombs knowing that Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world? And were you expecting something different? Was that a mistake not to restrict the use of these bombs in Gaza?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, you know, look, a couple of things. First of all, again, we've been very consistent from the beginning in terms of how we believe that Israel should approach addressing the threat of Hamas about the importance of precision in going after Hamas. And we've also been very clear that more needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of civilians, innocent civilians in Gaza.\n\nYou know, and I don't have to tell you again, the challenging environment here with an adversary that, again, embeds itself amongst the civilian population. That said, we absolutely do not want to see innocent lives lost in this tragic conflict. So again, we're going to continue to consult with Israel as they look at how to address Hamas in Rafah. And we will continue to do what we can to not only ensure that civilian safety is taken into account, but also look at how we can continue to get humanitarian assistance, whether it's by land, sea or air to help the - the people of Gaza.\n\nQ: ... one follow-up, and this is technical. Is there any interest in the Pentagon to look into how many civilians were killed by U.S.-provided bombs?\n\nGEN. RYDER: You know, look, Fadi, right now, there's an ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. And we understand the complex and dynamic nature of that conflict. So, our focus right now is on getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Also, continuing to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. And again, I'd highlight just several weeks ago when they were attacked by Iran in an unprecedented air attack. So, those threats are real.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, what we're all working toward alongside many partners in the international community is a situation where Israelis and Palestinians can live next to one another in peace. There can be security and stability in Gaza and the region. And again, we'll continue to work toward that.\n\nLet me go to Chris.\n\nQ: Thanks, Pat. Just quick clarification on the munitions. These are just purely the dump bombs themselves, not any associated guidance kit that may come along with it.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks. Chris, I appreciate the question. I'm just not going to be able to get into more specifics on the package itself.\n\nQ: Well, but I mean, presumably part of the issue is the nature of these weapons being unguided causing damage.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Again, I'm not going to get into the -- into more specifics. Yeah. I mean, you know how these systems work, right? You have bombs, which are essentially dumb bombs that you put JDAM kits on, but it relates to this particular shipment. I'm not going to get more specific on the details of that beyond what I've already provided.\n\nLet me just go to the phone here real quick. Washington Post, Missy Ryan.\n\nQ: Hey, Pat. Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First of all, could you speak to the DOD assessment of what impact, if any, the pause in these particular weapons will have on Israel's ability to continue its campaign or the -- anything about what you guys think the impact will be or maybe there will be no impact? And then, I have another question.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. So, I appreciate the question, Missy. I'm not going to get into assessing Israeli military operations and their readiness and potential impact on operations. Again, I think as we've highlighted, as we see the operations being conducted in Rafah and as we assess those, the decision has been made to pause this one shipment. So, I won't go beyond that. And your follow up?\n\nQ: Yeah. So, my other question is related to what Kirby said earlier at his gaggle about how, you know, the United States is hoping that Israel doesn't launch a full-fledged offensive into Rafah city, but that the U.S. will continue to work with Israel and other things, including sealing the border between Gaza and Egypt, and also helping Israel target leaders including Sinwar that, you know, the U.S. is doing on an ongoing basis, he said. And so, I'm just wondering if you could provide any more detail on those two activities since their military activity is like, what exactly is happening vis a vis trying to make the border more secure -- and then on the targeting front. Because it's a little bit confusing about the targeting set that the U.S. was not providing targeting assistance.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Thanks, Missy. So, to be unfortunately unsatisfying, I'm not going to have more details provide other than, again, broadly speaking. We understand and support Israel's right to defend itself. And, of course, as an important partner and ally, we're going to continue to consult with them as we have been from the beginning on how best to do that. But as it relates to those specifics, I don't have anything to provide beyond what Mr. Kirby already passed along.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Let me go to Jeff Schogol, Task & Purpose.\n\nQ: Thank you. You had mentioned that the incident in Florida is under investigation, but I'm just wondering, does the Defense Department have any advice or words for airmen at Hurlburt who may be feeling pretty angry right now over this incident?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. Again, you know, a tragic situation here. As I mentioned, you know, we're certainly, you know, saddened by the loss of our airmen. You know, we obviously need to allow the investigation to run its course. Don't want to get ahead of that. But you know, we certainly never want to see our airmen or any military member or any part of our DOD family be put into a situation like this. So again, we need to allow time for the investigation on this course. And you know, we'll certainly have more to say once we've had the opportunity to see that. Thanks. Lara.\n\nQ: Thank you. I was hoping you could give us DOD's assessment of Israel's campaign in Rafah right now. They've been doing airstrikes for weeks. My understanding is they evacuated hundred thousand people from a certain area. Now, they are bombing and on the ground in a certain part of Rafah. Can you say if that's generally correct? And does DOD assess that this is still a limited operation?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. So, we do assess at this stage that it is a limited operation. As I'm sure you can appreciate, I'm not in a position nor would I provide an operational briefing on behalf of Israel. But yes, it's -- all indications are at this time that it is a relatively limited operation meant to secure that area. And so, again, we'll continue to assess and monitor. That's all I've got at this point.\n\nQ: Have the Israelis briefed DOD on any additional plans to move further into Rafah or to expand the scope of the operation?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I don't have anything to pass along in that regard. Thank you. Sir.\n\nQ: Thank you, General. To what extent do you know that Hamas is on board with the JLOTS plan? Is there direct communication between U.S. military leadership and Hamas leaders to make sure that they're not going to try to scuttle this? And then, what happens if things go terribly wrong on the beachfront? Is it Israel responsibility or does the U.S. have contingency plans if Hamas were to attack the pier itself?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. So, to answer the question, no. No conversations between DOD and Hamas. And again, you know, I'm not going to get into its intelligence other than to say we have no intelligence at this point in time to indicate that Hamas is actively targeting JLOTS or the humanitarian assistance.\n\nThat said, look, this is a combat zone, it's a dangerous area. And -- and so we are going to continue to take security absolutely seriously. It's going to be a priority for this operation, it has been a priority for this operation. And we'll do what we need to ensure that our forces are protected and those that are supporting this -- this operation.\n\nAnd so, you know, to that point, I think as you see this go on, the commanders on the ground, the commander -- the U.S. commanders that are overseeing this out at -- at sea and from Israel, you know, they will have the authorities to make decisions as necessary, based on the conditions as it relates to any type of security situation.\n\nBut all that to say right now we would certainly hope that if Hamas truly does care about the Palestinian people, that they would not threaten humanitarian assistance being delivered to people in dire need. And for our part, we'll continue to work with the international community to rush that aid in.\n\nQ: And who's responsible for the security of these non-U.S. civilian contractors on the ground that are going to be on the pier and on the beach?\n\nGEN. RYDER: So as it relates to the -- the security at the assembly area where aid comes off, of course Israel will be providing security there and working and coordinating with World Food Program in order to -- and -- and others -- USAID and others to -- to provide that security on the ground. But again, I don't want to get into specific details on that for operation security reasons.\n\nLet me go to this gentleman.\n\nQ: Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the bombs. Do you have an assessment of how many of these heavy bombs that Israel already has? Like, do they already have a sustainable stockpile?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, I just -- I'm not going to get into the weapons inventory of a partner country. I'd -- I'd refer you to them to talk about their inventory.\n\nQ: ... quick follow on Rafah. You mentioned -- sorry -- on Rafah -- and I forgot what I was going to say.\n\nQ: Thank you, General. General, can you please tell us what's your definition of a large-scale operation in Rafah, or what would the Pentagon consider acceptable in terms of the number of casualties resulting of such operation?\n\nAnd I have another question.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah, thanks, Wafaa. So -- so look, you know, I -- I'm -- I'm not going to paint out hypothetical scenarios as it relates to Rafah. I think you -- you have to take a step back and -- and look at what we're talking about here.\n\nYou've got more than a million people condensed into a relatively small area. And doing any type of large-scale military operation within the confines of that area present significant risks to the civilian population there which has already been put in a very, very challenging situation.\n\nAnd -- and so our focus has been on communicating with our Israeli partners on the fact that we both agree that Hamas needs to be defeated and that we understand that Hamas has elements within Rafah, but to do it in a way that takes the safety of civilians into account as they conduct those operations.\n\nAnd so again, as we have observed the -- this limited operation so far and -- in a portion of Rafah, we're continuing to assess that, and in the meantime have paused that one shipment of weapons.\n\nAnd then I'm sorry, you had a follow-up?\n\nQ: Yes. So Mr. Kirby today talked about alternatives to defeat Hamas without the need for a -- the -- alternative that do not require large-scale invasion. Can you please talk a little bit about these alternatives?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm -- I'm sorry, Wafaa, you're coming in a little bit broken. Talk about what -- what ...\n\nQ: Alternatives to defeat Hamas that do not require large-scale invasion.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Gotcha. You know, so look, these are things that we've talked about in the past, in terms of sequencing, right? So the evacuation of civilians from the battle space to a degree where you don't have the large, you know, grouping of people that are -- could potentially be impacted by this. It's ensuring that when you have evacuated those -- those people, that they have access to food, water, sanitation, shelter. And then of course, approaching the Hamas threat in a precise manner, you know, counter-terrorism-style, as you've seen us and the Israelis do elsewhere in the past. So those are some examples.\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Two questions. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a press conference yesterday that he would not provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. Does the United States still want 155 millimeter artillery shells and offensive weapons supports from South Korea?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, look, I'll -- I'll let the Republic of Korea speak for itself when it comes to what they feel comfortable with providing to support Ukraine. As you know, the ROK are -- are an incredible ally and they certainly have provided assistance -- non-lethal assistance to Ukraine and support the broader effort to deter and prevent Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nBut again, it's for them to talk about. We're just grateful for any nation that can contribute in some way to help send a clear signal to authoritarian regimes that invading your democratic, peaceful neighbor is not acceptable behavior. Thank you.\n\nQ: ... Russia -- the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Russia will conduct [an] exercise on the use of tactical nuclear weapons. How can you predict possibility of cooperation between Russia and North Korea in the use of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, look, you know, I talked about this before. I've seen that reported in the press, and I would just say again it's irresponsible, reckless saber-rattling that is -- that is dangerous, given the current climate -- international security environment climate. And I'll just leave it at that.\n\nKonstantin?\n\nQ: Thanks, Pat. On senior airman Fortson, can you say whether -- it -- the Defense Department or the Air Force is assisting or -- with the investigation?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'd have to refer you to the Air Force. You know, again, the -- as I understand it, the Florida civil authorities are investigating, but I'd refer you to the Air Force for any more questions on that.\n\nYounis?\n\nQ: Thank you very much, General. The fact that the President said that U.S. bombs were used to kill civilians in Gaza is pretty striking. Does that mean that the -- the Israeli military campaign has somehow made the United States complicit in it -- in any of that? Is that why the Biden administration is now saying \"we don't want any part of that in Rafah\"? Is that -- is that ...\n\nGEN. RYDER: Well, look, I'm -- I'm not going to speak for the President. I think we -- again, we've been very clear from the beginning that after Israel was attacked by Hamas on October 7th, and again, I think it's important to remember that 1,200 people killed, over 250 hostages taken. Half of whom are still being held. And it's important that no one forget that fact that Hamas is still holding these individuals hostage.\n\nOur focus has been on supporting Israel to defend itself from attacks by Hamas and so that they can defend their people and prevent another October 7th from happening. At the same time, as this conflict has progressed, we've seen the unfortunate impact that it's had on the civilian population in Gaza.\n\nAnd again, we've been very clear that we do not want to see innocent civilians killed, whether they'd be Palestinian or Israeli. And so we've been working very closely with the international community to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We've been working to ensure that Israel has the ability to defend itself, but we also recognize the fact that more needs to be done to safeguard civilians in the battle space. And so, again, we'll continue to work toward that.\n\nQ: I have one follow-up. If the President makes that determination that U.S. bombs are killing civilians anywhere, you know, any country that you've supplied those weapons to, does that determination come from the Department of Defense to the White House? And if so, what's the standard procedure with that said country?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Again, I appreciate the question. I'm just not going to get into hypotheticals. As you know, we have a process by which we employ when it comes to evaluating the use of security assistance. And that process is currently ongoing. It's led by the State Department, so I'd refer you to them in that regard.\n\nYes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. Two quick question on -- in Syria, especially in northeast Syria. You know, according to some local reports on local people, Iran is endeavoring to expand its influence, you know, in Syria. And this is by using the local tribes, especially the Arak tribes, to establish some proxy groups with -- which they established in Iraq -- no, in Syria. So is that something that concerns you? Or have you ever noticed this? And is there -- this is concerns you or has any rise eyebrows in Washington?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. I mean, look, this is not new behavior from Iran. It's how they do business, right? So essentially, by trying to train and influence proxy groups to essentially project their foreign policy of trying to expel the U.S. and other partners from the region in order to be able to do whatever it is they want to do unchecked. And so, of course, that's something that we continue to keep an eye on, you know?\n\nAnd I think it's important that from a U.S. perspective, you know, when it comes to the Middle East region, we respect the sovereignty of the countries that we work with, unlike some of these proxy groups, which have embedded themselves into the region. And when it comes to uncovered spaces like Syria, we're going to continue to stay focused, number one, on the defeat ISIS mission, but we're also going to maintain awareness of broader regional threats as we work with allies and partners to keep an eye on it. And again, to prevent potential, you know, future situations whereby our forces are citizens or, you know, importantly, our allies and partners are threatened.\n\nQ: Last question. As you spoke of the ISIS, according to the security officials in northern Syria, the ISIS activities in increasing the past five months. And one of the security officials said that the ISIS is slowly but surely growing stronger. And in the recent day, they killed a member of the SDF. So what's your assessment on that, especially on the ISIS activities? And how do you - going to help the - the SDF to prevent the resurgence of the ISIS?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Well, again, the international coalition to defeat ISIS still exists today. And we continue to work closely with the international community to address the ISIS threat. As it relates to Iraq and Syria, ISIS is by no means what it was 10 years ago. And that's a good thing.\n\nThat said, to your point, we can't rest on our laurels and we need to continue to work together to prevent a resurgence of ISIS in that that region. You still have places like Al-Hawl, which contains, you know, several thousand ISIS prisoners that need to be repatriated back to their countries of origin. And so we continue to work with the international community on that front.\n\nWhen you look more broadly in terms of ISIS around the world in places like Africa or Afghanistan, you do see ISIS starting to gain some traction. And so this will continue to be something that's very important from a counterterrorism standpoint and a threat we need to continue to take seriously.\n\nThank you. Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Thank you, General. So two questions. One on Syria. Recently, U.S. expatriates like some prisoners from the Al-Hawl camps. And there are 11, I think, 11 people. And one is a non-U. S. citizen. So how does count?\n\nGEN. RYDER: I'm sorry, the 11 prisoners that..\n\nQ: ... from the Al-Hawl camps that -- like ISIS members, but U.S. expatriated them to the country. One is a non-U.S. citizen.\n\nGEN. RYDER: If I understand your correct question correctly. So essentially, yes. I mean, that is the goal is to essentially repatriate those individuals back to their countries of origin so that they can be -- it can be addressed in their own domestic legal systems on how best to, you know, address that threat.\n\nAgain, what you don't want is essentially a terrorist breeding ground where it essentially becomes a tinderbox waiting to explode. And so I know U.S. Central Command, U.S. State Department, has been working very closely with partners throughout the region, throughout the world to address this, and, of course, working with the SDF from a -- the forces that are actually running and maintaining that facility.\n\nQ: One question on Rafah. Well, you are working on building piers to provide humanitarian aid into Gaza. And as you know, the Israel has controlled border gates into Rafah. How has that made it difficult to get aid into Gaza, into Rafah?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. So, you know, broadly speaking again, what you're seeing here and, you know, another way to look at this pier is essentially as another gate into Rafah to get aid into. So in addition to working to make sure that there's an increase in flow of aid via land, it's also -- we also have the opportunity via sea. And as you know, we've also been providing aid via air. So that's the way that we look at it. Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Hey, Pat. I just want -- Israel, I think, has done as much or more to secure noncombatants in Rafah as the U.S. has done in its own urban -- difficult urban battles in the past, going from Fallujah, all the way back to the Battle of Manila in the Second World War. Is the U.S. holding Israel to a standard, an unreasonable standard that it has never really bothered to secure for itself?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So, yeah. So look, I'm going to look at every situation based on its merits, based on the current operating environment. And the fact is, we are where we are today. And I think we've been very clear, both publicly and privately that as Israel contemplates its operations in Rafah, that we would expect to see it be done in a way that takes civilian safety into account.\n\nAnd, you know, again, the President and Secretary Austin have both said that as we assess what's happening in Rafah right now, we put a pause on this one shipment of weapons. Again, taking a step back to be clear, our commitment to Israel's defense will remain iron clad. And we will continue to ensure and take all necessary steps to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself from threats in the region to include Hamas.\n\nQ: Yeah, October 7th, the President said that he was behind Israel's plan to destroy Hamas. Is that still the case anymore or is he sort of winding that back?\n\nGEN. RYDER: We believe that Hamas needs to be defeated. Absolutely. Thank you. Sure.\n\nQ: Just a quick point of clarification. On the Israeli military's relatively limited incursion vicinity of Rafah, I believe Israeli officials have said that it's intended to cut off the weapons to Hamas in that area.\n\nTo what extent does this resemble -- the initial move -- the IDF made here? To what extent does that resemble that, you know, the tailored operational plans, U.S. officials have discussed with their Israeli counterparts or does this appear to be more consistent with shaping operations for larger scale ground clearing?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Again, I'm not going to get into trying to characterize from the podium here detailed Israeli operations other than, again, what we've observed and what they've told us in terms of it being a limited operation. So last question. Yes, sir?\n\nQ: Sir, two questions, please. One, conflicts around the globe still going on, one after another, and they are connected with military. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi still influenced among global leaders. Do you think he has any power, any influence to stop and end these conflicts and wars going on?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Are you asking me if Prime Minister Modi has influence to stop conflicts?\n\nQ: Some of the leaders where these wars are going on, like, Russia, in Ukraine, and in the Middle East, and all that influences more than ever today.\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. I appreciate the question, (inaudible). As I'm sure you can appreciate, I'm not going to make a judgment regarding the leader of India, other than to say that, look, India is an important and strategic nation, and a very important part of the world. And from a U.S. standpoint, we, of course, very much appreciate the relationship that we have with India and from a defense department standpoint. Look forward to continuing to bolster our security cooperation relationship. Thank you.\n\nQ: Secretaries of State and Treasury were in China recently, and both of them warned China in their own ways and different that not to influence elections or not to interfere in the U.S. interference in many ways, including cyber and all that.\n\nMy question is, is this building, DOD or Pentagon, affected about or about those warning to China in any way as far as the U.S. and national security is concerned?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Yeah. Look, when it comes to election security, the Department of Defense, of course, plays a role in that as you know. I won't get into the specifics of that other than it's something that we take very seriously to ensure the integrity of our own elections to include on the cyber side.

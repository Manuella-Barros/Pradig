Another time we were awakened by him chipping golf balls into pots outside of our bedroom to wake us up in time for a golf tournament.\n\n\"Anything that would make plenty of noise so that we'd be on the road in time. And in this case five in the morning.\"\n\nAn audio clip of \u00d3 Muircheartaigh reflecting on his upbringing and his love of Co Kerry was then played to mourners.\n\nAt the start of the mass, \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's grandchildren brought symbols of his talents and interests to the altar.\n\nDescribed by his daughter Eadaoin, they represented his love of all types of sports- Gaelic games and golf particularly. A children's book he wrote about the history of Croke Park was also brought up.\n\nA dictionary and a piece of art was brought up to represent his love for the Irish language.\n\nHis teaching degree that he achieved in 1951 and family photos were also brought to the altar as symbols.\n\nA Sam McGuire cup brought from Malawi in Africa was also presented.\n\nHis daughter explained the significance of that item: \"Dad spent a while there doing charity work, so we have this as a symbol of his volunteering work and travel that he did.\"\n\nFollowing his death, President of Ireland Mr Higgins said \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's commentaries captured \"like no other the sense of occasion, the atmosphere in the stadium and on the terraces, the ebb and flow of the play and of every movement\".\n\nSince his passing, people have been reminiscing on the one-liners that made his commentary so unique.\n\nMany have cited his description of Cork hurler and footballer Se\u00e1n \u00d3g \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn, about whom \u00d3 Muircheartaigh once remarked: \"His father's from Fermanagh, his mother's from Fiji - neither a hurling stronghold.\"\n\nAnother is: \"The stopwatch has stopped.

One of the best known was about Cork gaelic footballer Anthony Lynch whom he described as 'the last person to let you down - his people are undertakers'.\n\nThe commentator's son Aonghus told his funeral that, unknown to the family, his father had arranged several years ago to have his casket made by the Lynch family undertakers.\n\n'A little bit of his humour maybe and completing the story properly,' his son said.\n\nA teacher before he joined RT\u00c9 full-time in the 1980s, Mr O Muircheartaigh commentated in both the Irish and English languages.\n\nHis life as a sports commentator began many years before taking on the job full time, describing his first match in 1949.\n\nM\u00edche\u00e1l is survived by his wife Helena, his children Eamonn, Niamh, Aonghus, Cormac, Neasa, Nuala, Eadaoin and Doireann, and his grandchildren.\n\nFormer Kerry footballer and fellow broadcaster M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 S\u00e9 delivered a tribute in Irish during the service.\n\nHe said the greatest compliment you can give to any Irish person is to say they are a good storyteller.\n\n'M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was an extraordinary storyteller,' he said. 'A microphone in Michael's hand was like a brush in the hand of an artist.'\n\nMr \u00d3 S\u00e9 said M\u00edche\u00e1l loved the big sporting occasions, which would give extra energy to his commentaries, and he put thousands under a spell with his words.\n\n'He was the voice of the nation,' he added.\n\nHe said that commentary changed a lot between 1949 when Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh started and when he retired in 2010. But he said he did not need to change anything, as he had his own style.\n\n'All he needed was a copy book, the two teams written out himself, and biros of every colour suiting the colour of the hurlers' helmets,' he added.\n\nThe commentator's son Aonghus delivered a family tribute near the close of the service.\n\n'He had great energy and enthusiasm for action and didn't believe in tiredness,' he recalled.\n\n'Some parents might be awakened by their children jumping up and down on a bed. We experienced the opposite.\n\n'Dad would literally jump up and down early mornings, he often woke his children and grandchildren banging pots and pans together. Another time we were awakened by him chipping golf balls into pots outside of our bedroom to wake us up in time for a golf tournament.\n\n'Anything that would make plenty of noise so that we'd be on the road in time. And in this case five in the morning.'\n\nAn audio clip of Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh reflecting on his upbringing and his love of Co Kerry was then played to mourners.\n\nAt the start of the mass, Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's grandchildren brought symbols of his talents and interests to the altar.\n\nDescribed by his daughter Eadaoin, they represented his love of all types of sports - Gaelic games and golf particularly. A children's book he wrote about the history of Croke Park was also brought up.\n\nA dictionary and a piece of art was brought up to represent his love for the Irish language.\n\nHis teaching degree that he achieved in 1951 and family photos were also brought to the altar as symbols.\n\nA Sam McGuire cup brought from Malawi in Africa was also presented.\n\nHis daughter explained the significance of that item: 'Dad spent a while there doing charity work, so we have this as a symbol of his volunteering work and travel that he did.'\n\nFollowing his death, President of Ireland Mr Higgins said Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's ommentaries captured 'like no other the sense of occasion, the atmosphere in the stadium and on the terraces, the ebb and flow of the play and of every movement'.\n\nSince his passing, people have been reminiscing on the one-liners that made his commentary so unique.\n\nMany have cited his description of Cork hurler and footballer Se\u00e1n \u00d3g \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn about whom Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh once remarked: 'His father's from Fermanagh, his mother's from Fiji - neither a hurling stronghold.'\n\nAnother is: 'The stopwatch has stopped.

The coffin was draped in a Kerry flag.\n\nHomily\n\nIn his homily, Fr Michael Moynihan said \u00d3 Muircheartaigh had lived a \"remarkable\" life. He said news of his death was met with sadness across Ireland.\n\n\"It felt like the end of an era,\" he said.\n\n\"It is evident people across the country had a great fondness for Micheal - he was like a grandfather figure to our nation for over 60 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He was part of the life in our kitchens and sitting rooms as we gathered to follow football and hurling matches. Even though he was retired since 2010, we felt that a chapter in our lives had closed (when he died), never to be reopened again.\"\n\nHe added: \"We were blessed with his presence for 93 years. As we reflect on his life's journey, we recognise a life filled with passion, dedication and an enduring love for the Irish language, for education, for sport and for culture. He brought that passion to all he did.\n\nKerry held a special place in Micheal's heart, his love for this beautiful county was very evident, from its landscape to its people, from its history to its culture. Kerry was a source of joy and pride which was both genuine and inspiring.\n\nFamous one liners\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh was famous for his one-liners during commentaries. One of the best-known was about Cork Gaelic footballer Anthony Lynch whom he described as \"the last person to let you down - his people are undertakers\".\n\nThe commentator's son Aonghus told his funeral that, unknown to the family, his father had arranged several years ago to have his casket made by the Lynch family undertakers.\n\n\"A little bit of his humour maybe and completing the story properly,\" his son said.\n\nA teacher before he joined RT\u00c9 full-time in the 1980s, \u00d3 Muircheartaigh commentated in both the Irish and English languages.\n\nHis life as a sports commentator began many years before taking on the job full-time, describing his first match in 1949.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh is survived by his wife Helena, his children Eamonn, Niamh, Aonghus, Cormac, Neasa, Nuala, Eadaoin and Doireann, and his grandchildren.\n\nFormer Kerry footballer and fellow broadcaster Micheal O Se delivered a tribute in Irish during the service.\n\nHe said the greatest compliment you can give to any Irish person is to say they are a good storyteller.\n\n\"Micheal \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was an extraordinary storyteller,\" he said. \"A microphone in Michael's hand was like a brush in the hand of an artist.\"\n\n\u00d3 Se said \u00d3 Muircheartaigh loved the big sporting occasions, which would give extra energy to his commentaries, and he put thousands under a spell with his words.\n\n\"He was the voice of the nation,\" he added.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh's body lay in repose in O'Connor's Funeral Home in Dingle yesterday, where crowds gathered to pay their respects. Among those who paid their respects was Taoiseach Simon Harris.\n\nWith reporting from Press Association\n\nWritten by Cormac Fitzgerald and posted on TheJournal.ie", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "view_all_articles@the42.ie", "name": "View All Articles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00edche\u00e1l_\u00d3_Muircheartaigh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kerry GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moynihan_(Kerry_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Moynihan (Kerry politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milltown_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milltown Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_Misericordiae_University_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mater Misericordiae University Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Lynch_(Gaelic_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Lynch (Gaelic footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheJournal.ie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TheJournal.ie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6422539/listing?version=6422476&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693108", "eventUri": "eng-9693108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Muircheartaigh told those gathered how he and his family had heard stories this week from friends, colleagues and past pupils about the impact his father had on them.\n\nHe also explained that the wit

might be awakened by their children jumping up and down in a bed.\n\n\"We experienced the opposite, Dad would literally jump up and down early mornings.\n\n\"He often woke his children and grandchildren, banging pots and pans together.\n\n\"Another time, we were awakened by him chipping golf balls into pots outside of our bedroom to wake us up in time for a golf tournament.\n\n\"Anything that could make plenty of noise so that we'd be on the road in time, and in this case, five in the morning.\"\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh was laid to rest at the nearby St

Never was this truer than with M\u00edche\u00e1l", "body": "Among the many legendary quotes M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh treated us to over the years, one of the standouts was: 'Anthony Lynch, the Cork corner back, will be the last person to let you down - his people are undertakers.'\n\nIt was, therefore, a slyly humorous piece of symmetry that, some years ago, and unknown to his family, M\u00edche\u00e1l instructed Dingle funeral director D\u00f3nal O'Connor to make sure his coffin was made in Baile Bhuirne, in Co. Cork, by the very same Lynch family.\n\nIt also connected him to a piece of his past, as it was in Ballyvourney that M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh began his training as a teacher, before leaving the profession in 1985 to become a full-time commentator.\n\nYesterday's Requiem Mass in St Mary's Church in the Co. Kerry town was filled with warmth and humour and, like so many legendary commentaries, conducted in both Irish and English, with many speakers seamlessly switching between the two.\n\nThe symbols to represent M\u00edche\u00e1l's life were carried to the altar by his grandchildren.\n\nThey included a microphone and a typewriter to reflect his professional life; a football, a hurl, a golf club, and a book he wrote on the history of Croke Park, for his sporting passions; and a copy of Dinneen's Irish-English Dictionary ('faigh Dinneen', or 'get Dinneen', was a common call in the family home).\n\nThere was also a photograph taken of M\u00edche\u00e1l on his graduation day; a photo of him and his wife Helena with their eight children - \u00c9adaoin, Niamh, Eamonn, Doireann, Aonghus, Cormac, Nuala and Neasa; a wooden copy of the Sam Maguire cup he had made in Malawi, representing both his love of travel and his charity work; and, finally and fittingly, a Kerry flag for the native county he loved so much.\n\nAmong early arrivals were T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin and Minister for Education Norma Foley, herself a Kerry woman.\n\nMr Martin said he believed we never would see the like of M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh again and noted the commentator was often the first to bring talent in the minor championships to public attention, with many of those name-checked going on to hero status in the Seniors. President Michael D.\n\nHiggins was represented by his aide de camp Captain Tomas Bell, while Commandant Claire Mortimer represented Taoiseach Simon Harris, who himself flew directly from Brussels to Kerry Airport in Farranfore on Thursday, and by car to Dingle, to pay his respects.\n\nGAA President Jarlath Burns read a Prayer of the Faithful, which included thanks to the staff of the Mater Hospital, who looked after M\u00edche\u00e1l in his final illness - his son Aonghus said he had a list of maybe 50 names of nurses, doctors, porters and other staff whose kindness and care the family never would forget.\n\nAnother prayer paid tribute to D\u00fan S\u00edon, the village three kilometres from Dingle from which he hailed. 'M\u00edche\u00e1l's home place was very important to him,' it read.\n\n'We pray for those worldwide who have to flee their home place - may they find shelter and understanding.'\n\nFr Michael Moynihan reflected the affection for the late broadcaster expressed by so many since his death on Tuesday.'He was like a grandfather figure to our nation,' he said.\n\n'It felt like the end of an era. He was part of the life in our kitchens and sitting rooms, as we gathered to follow football and hurling matches. Even though he was retired since 2010, we felt that a chapter in our lives was closed, never to be reopened again. '\n\n'There is an African saying which says, \"When an older person dies, a library burns.\"\n\nHow true that saying is as we gather today to celebrate the life of a remarkable man. We were blessed with his presence for 93 years.\n\nAs we reflect on his life's journey, we recognise a life filled with passion, dedication, and an enduring love for the Irish language, for education, for sport and for culture. He brought that passion to all he did.\n\n'His ability to switch seamlessly between Irish and English was poetic. M\u00edche\u00e1l's love for the Irish language was a testament to his deep love for our culture and history, making him a true custodian of our linguistic heritage.'\n\nFr Moynihan also spoke of M\u00edche\u00e1l's professional life. 'His love for Gaelic games was profound,' he said.\n\n'He painted so many wonderful pictures with his bilingual commentary and turn of phrase. His enthusiasm was infectious. His commentaries, assisted by family members, were passionate and energetic. The added details from his wealth of research His passion for the games was a reflection of his love for community and tradition, values he held dear throughout his life.'\n\nFormer Kerry footballer and broadcaster M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 S\u00e9 said Mr \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was 'an extraordinary storyteller'.\n\n'A microphone in [his] hand was like a brush in the hand of an artist.' In his eulogy, son Aonghus spoke of his father's life as a teacher and noted former pupils often approached him to tell how he changed their lives.\n\nOne reminded him how when his own father died, M\u00edche\u00e1l saw the death notice in the paper, and not only sent a Mass card, but kept a special eye on the boy in the weeks and months afterwards.\n\nThat is the sort of man M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was - involved, empathetic and kind. The last words at his funeral were his own, as a clip of him talking about his childhood was played.\n\nThe entire church hushed at the sound of that wonderful, mellifluous voice. Just after he was born, he said, he contracted pneumonia, so he was brought by horse and cart to this very church and baptised at just six days old.

It's over the bar. This man shouldn't be playing football. He's made an almost Lazarus-like recovery from a heart condition. Lazarus was a great man but he couldn't kick points like Colin Corkery'.\n\nHe style was unique and unconsciously beautiful, like a young child out in the back garden describing a match in his mind's eye.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh's commentaries were always decorated by an instinctive and authentic style, never forced, with that relaxed and natural wit and charm always appealing to his listeners.\n\nAlthough he did Irish commentaries on the All-Ireland minor semi-finals and finals for years, \u00d3 Muircheartaigh never embraced television commentary.\n\nIn so many ways, it was easy to see why -- it was the wrong medium for his talents.\n\nOn a TV screen, the viewer can see what's happening. On radio, the listener's needs are dependent on the commentator to paint the picture. And \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was one of the great painters.\n\nGrowing up in the small village of D\u00fan S\u00edon, three miles from Dingle, there were eight families in the area and all the houses were reasonably close to each other. People went without invitation into any house they liked. Nobody locked their door.\n\nEveryone was welcome.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh once recalled how, from an early age, a man used to visit their house every night for discussions with his father about different aspects of life.\n\n\"There was a lot of wordage to be collected from that generation,\" \u00d3 Muircheartaigh once said.\n\nHe honed that craft and put that experience to great use on the airwaves but \u00d3 Muircheartaigh wasn't always an observer or a storyteller.\n\nWhen Mick O'Dwyer took over as Kerry manager after the 1974 championship the Kerry county board asked \u00d3 Muircheartaigh to train the Kerry players that were based in Dublin. He ended up doing it for the next 17 years. Over time players from other counties exiled in Dublin joined them and swelled their ranks.\n\nENDURING BONDS\n\nSome of the bonds he forged back then created lifelong friendships.\n\nThe first time Jack O'Shea met \u00d3 Muircheartaigh was in 1975 when he was still only 17. He was playing with the Kerry minors but was in Dublin to start a plumbing course and the manager Seamus Fitzgerald had asked \u00d3 Muircheartaigh to take O'Shea for training.\n\nO'Shea was in his bedroom in Phibsborough getting settled when he heard \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's voice booming up the stairs.\n\n\"His brief was to get us fit, but he didn't follow Micko's template,\" wrote O'Shea once in his Sunday Times column. \"Where O'Dwyer's training sessions in Kerry were brutal, Miche\u00e1l injected some humanity into his.\"\n\nMuch like the great players, part of \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's performance was natural and spontaneous.\n\nHis signature lines were brilliantly innate and inherent but his detail was always embellished by the research. That legwork and breadth of knowledge also strengthened his connection with the players.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh always made it his business to get to know those he was telling everyone else about on air. He didn't regard it as a chore and he didn't do it to be their friend.\n\nHis commentaries depended on a knowledge of players that couldn't all be acquired from a distance.\n\nThe former Dublin player and current Louth manager Ger Brennan told a story during the week of his first time meeting \u00d3 Muircheartaigh. Brennan was fresh on the Dublin team for a match in Parnell Park against Kerry.\n\nAs Brennan was walking the pitch beforehand, he came across \u00d3 Muircheartaigh. Brennan didn't think he knew him but he came over, shook his hand and began speaking about his uncles Tom and Fran Brennan.\n\nFran played soccer for Dundalk and won an International cap for Ireland while Tom ran cross-country for Ireland. Brennan was taken aback by how much \u00d3 Muircheartaigh knew about his background.\n\nHis memory was so prodigious and vast that \u00d3 Muircheartaigh always had a treasure trove to dip into. And the glitter from that gold enhanced his descriptions of what was playing out in front of him.\n\nHe once said that his job was to tell the listener what was happening with as much clarity as possible. \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's brilliance enriched the GAA beyond words.\n\nFOREVER\n\nHis most evocative lines will endure forever in the affectionate memories of his audience. It was always about the story.\n\nAnd the GAA were lucky that they had one of the greatest storytellers ever in \u00d3 Muircheartaigh.\n\nIn the mind's eye of so many, Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh will always be the sound of Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00edche\u00e1l_\u00d3_Muircheartaigh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerry GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Corkery", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colin Corkery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Shea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Shea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_O'Shea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack O'Shea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_O'Dwyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick O'Dwyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ger Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parnell_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parnell Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Dwyers_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O'Dwyers GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louth_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louth GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phibsborough", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phibsborough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phibsborough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dundalk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8363/4181728_4_seoimageog_2003_073_1_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693108", "eventUri": "eng-9693108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Such was his \u00adfollowing many viewers would mute the television to listen to \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's radio commentary. His wry, deadpan observations became famous and were repeated last week in \u00adtributes that filled airwaves and column inches.\n\n\"Se\u00e1n \u00d3g \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn: his father's from Fermanagh, his mother's from Fiji. Neither a hurling stronghold,\" was a favourite. So too was: \"Teddy looks at the ball, the ball looks at Teddy.\"\n\nAnd also: \"Here's Sylvie Linnane, who drives a digger on a Monday and turns into one on a Sunday.\" Plus: \"Anthony Lynch, the Cork corner-back, will be the last person to let you down - his people are undertakers.\"\n\nAnd: \"Teddy McCarthy to Mick McCarthy, no relation. Mick McCarthy back to Teddy McCarthy, still no relation.\"\n\nIt wasn't just one-liners, \u00d3 Muircheartaigh wove slice-of-life tales into the commentary. \"I saw a few Sligo people at Mass in Gardiner Street this morning and the omens seem to be good for them,\" he told listeners during a Sligo-Dublin game. \"The priest was wearing the same colours as the Sligo jersey! 40 yards out on the Hogan Stand side of the field, Ciar\u00e1n Whelan goes on a rampage ... it's a goal! So much for religion.\"\n\nAnother one: \"Brian Dooher is down injured. And while he is, I'll tell ye a little story, I was in Times Square in New York last week, and I was missing the championship back home. So I approached a newsstand and I said, 'I suppose ye wouldn't have the Kerryman, would you?' To which, the Egyptian behind the counter turned to me and he said, 'Do you want the North Kerry edition, or the South Kerry edition?' He had both - so I bought both. And Dooher is back on his feet.\"\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh was born in D\u00fan S\u00edon near Dingle, County Kerry, and upon attending an Irish language school changed his name from Michael Moriarty to the Irish version. In 1949, RT\u00c9 used a hurling game at Croke park to audition him, and 10 fellow trainee teachers, for a commentating job.\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh had never seen a hurling game before - Kerry favours football - but by fluke knew one of the goalkeepers who made a spectacular save and scored a penalty during \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's five-minute slot, gifting an opportunity for dramatic, knowledgeable commentary.\n\nThe father of eight went on to become RT\u00c9's premier radio commentator, or as some put it a \"bard of the ballgames\" who laced matches with humour and whimsy.\n\n\"The stopwatch has stopped. It's up to God and the referee now. The referee is Pat Horan. God is God,\" he once said.\n\n\"Pat Fox has it on his hurl and is motoring well now, but here comes Joe Rabbitte hot on his tail ... I've seen it all now, a Rabbitte chasing a Fox around Croke Park!\"\n\n\u00d3 Muircheartaigh could seemingly braid any anecdote with on-field action. \"Pat Fox out to the 40 and grabs the sliothar. I bought a dog from his father last week. Fox turns and sprints for goal. The dog ran a great race last Tuesday in Limerick. Fox to the 21 fires a shot, it goes to the left and wide ... and the dog lost as well.\"\n\nGAA clubs provided guards of honour as \u00d3 Muircheartaigh's funeral cortege wound through Kerry. The funeral was in Dingle on Saturday.\n\nThe taoiseach, Simon Harris, said the broadcaster was a link to a diaspora that tuned into him from around the world. \"His voice, his colour, his excitement, his love of sport, his turn of phrase were often as exhilarating as the action he was describing on the pitch as the audience held its breath for what M\u00edche\u00e1l would say next.\"", "source":

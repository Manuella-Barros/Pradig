Hashtag weird.\"\n\nIt was Stanton's third hardest-hit home run since Statcast tracking began in 2015. He launched a 121.7 mph drive off the bat against Texas in August 2018 -- the big league record in the Statcast era -- and a 121.3 mph shot at Washington in July 2020 that ranks second.\n\nThe home run was also the fifth hardest-hit homer tracked by Statcast. Atlanta star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. hit a 121.2 mph shot last September at Dodger Stadium, and Yankees teammate Aaron Judge crushed a 121.1 mph drive in June 2017 against Baltimore.\n\nStanton's solo shot gave New York a 5-1 lead, two batters after Judge opened the inning with his eighth home run.\n\nIt was the third time this season the duo went deep in the same game. The Yankees are 34-4 when Judge and Stanton homer in the same game, including the postseason.\n\n\"I feel like the night before he had the hardest hit in baseball,\" Judge said. \"Then he outdid himself again tonight. Just impressive. He's staying through the baseball well, using the whole field. When he's using the whole field, that's when I know he's locked in.\n\n\"It's been fun to watch him do his thing this year for sure, especially trying to bounce back after last year.\"\n\nStanton is hitting .228 with eight homers and 20 RBIs. Last season, he missed two months with a hamstring injury and batted a career-low .191 with 24 homers and 60 RBIs as the Yankees finished 82-80 and barely avoided their first losing season since 1992.\n\nJudge and Stanton homered after Juan Soto hit a two-run shot on the first pitch he saw in the first inning. It was the first time the power trio all went deep in the same game for the Yankees.\n\n\"G, it's just how hard he hit the ball is amazing,\" Soto said. \"You don't see guys hitting balls 120 (mph) every day.\"\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@reformer.com",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nNew York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton is back pummeling baseballs, and this time against the Houston Astros, he hit the hardest ball in the 2024 MLB season.\n\nIt was the third inning when Stanton caught every single stitch of a 1-2 curveball from Astros rookie starter Spencer Arrighetti, and it sped like a rocket off his bat toward left field. It was not a matter of whether this ball would get out, but rather if it would stay fair.\n\nThe ball stayed in fair territory and Stanton started trotting around the bases, as Stanton's solo homer made it a 5-1 game. Stanton went back-to-back with Aaron Judge, who hit one to right center one at-bat prior, and Juan Soto put one out in the first inning to take an early lead as well.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nAfter Statcast ran its measurements on Stanton's blast, the exit velocity measured at 119.9 mph - the fastest hit ball in the league this season.\n\nThis comes after Stanton smashed a 447-foot home run off Justin Verlander on Tuesday night, which hit 118.8 mph off his bat in the 10-3 victory.\n\nVIEW THE POST ON X\n\nTHE ASTROS ARE LOADED BUT THEY KEEP LOSING. COULD THEY BECOME SELLERS?\n\nStanton is no stranger to breaking the radar gun when he makes contact with baseballs. In fact, this solo shot is just the third hardest-hit home run he has had in the Statcast era, which began in 2015.\n\nThe highest exit velocity on a home run came from Stanton in 2018, when he blasted a 121.7 mph homer against the Texas Rangers. He also has a 121.3 mph home run against the Washington Nationals, which ranks second in July 2020.\n\nThe Yankees want nothing more than Stanton to remain healthy throughout the 2024 season because pitchers fear his ability to break open a game with his power.\n\nHe has had trouble with injuries in recent seasons, and even when he is playing, fans have complained about his lack of hustle around the bases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, Stanton is just trying to remain available so he can do what he did Wednesday night, which is his greatest asset.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(ball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball (ball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/Giancarlo-Stanton.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551773", "eventUri": "eng-9551773", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 1681, "textEnd": 1690}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Although Stanton is now in his age-34 season and made noticeable changes to his physique and swing during the offseason, his incredible power and bat speed are still present and were on full display on both Tuesday and Wednesday night.\n\nEntering Tuesday, Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers had the hardest-hit ball in the majors when he hit a single with a 119.2 mph exit velocity on April 27. Stanton, facing Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander, nearly matched Ohtani's mark when he hit a frozen rope with a 118.8 mph exit velocity; although it had a launch angle of just 15 degrees, it traveled 421 feet and landed into the visitor's bullpen in left-center field for a home run. It was, at the time, the hardest-hit homer of the year.\n\nThe next night, Stanton one-upped himself - and Ohtani.\n\nIn the bottom of the third inning on Wednesday night, Stanton faced struggling Astros starter Spencer Arrighetti and on a 1-2 count, got a hanging curveball that was center-cut. He got every stitch of the ball and sent a laser that landed into the left field second deck in the blink of an eye. Stanton hit the ball just shy of 120 mph - with an unfathomable 119.9 mph exit velocity; in comparison to the home run the previous night, this one had a bit more elevation, with a 20 degree launch angle.\n\nBatting either cleanup or fifth in the lineup, Stanton has eight home runs on the year, tied with Aaron Judge (who also homered on Wednesday) for the second-most on the team (Juan Soto, who also hit a homer on Wednesday, has nine). Although he only has a .228 batting average, his .472 slugging percentage has given the Yankees a fearsome heart of the order that finally appears to be clicking.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4898,h_2755,x_0,y_44/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_pinstripes/01hxddvz4az7m1z94b97.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551773", "eventUri": "eng-9551773", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 750, "textEnd": 758}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Not surprisingly, he has the other two.\n\nAnd like most of the rest of the Yankees, he has feasted on the Astros this year, with three homers in five games.\n\nHe also has six home runs in his last 11 games versus Houston.\n\n\"It's impressive,\" Judge said of Stanton's recent outburst. \"He's staying through the baseball well and using the whole field. That's when you know he's locked in. It's been fun to watch him do his thing this year, especially trying to bounce back from last year.\"\n\nLast year, of course, was ugly, with Stanton hitting just .191 with an unsightly OPS of .695, as he struggled again to stay healthy.\n\nStanton's OPS is now a more respectable .758, which has allowed Boone to keep him in the middle of the lineup.\n\nAnd Stanton is also still the active home run leader in the majors, with 410.\n\nBefore Mike Trout got hurt again, it seemed the Angels' slugger might have a chance at closing in on Stanton's mark this season, since Trout is second on the list, with 378. But a torn meniscus that will require surgery on Trout's knee will keep him at that number for the foreseeable future.\n\nJoey Votto, third on the list at 356, is still rehabbing an ankle injury suffered during the spring, shortly after he signed with the Blue Jays.\n\nSo it will be a while before anyone catches Stanton.\n\nAsked what the mark means to him, Stanton said, \"It's pretty cool. Why wouldn't it be cool to have something like that? But it makes me feel a little old at the same time.\"\n\nAnd the longer he holds onto his home run milestone, the better.\n\n\"It's bound to happen someday, that somebody gets it, but it's a good thing to try to keep,\" Stanton said. \"It doesn't just show how many years you've played, but that you've been productive. And if I can add to it, hopefully that means I'm still being productive.\"\n\nStanton's average exit velocity has decreased each of the past three seasons, but remains among the best in the league.\n\nHis power numbers are also lessening and he's walking at a lower rate this year than at any other point in his career.

The ball was just fair and went 447 feet. It was Stanton's second home run in as many nights, as he hit a 118.8 mph home run off of Justin Verlander in the Yankees' 10-3 win over the Astros.\n\nWhile Stanton is not playing to his peak performance from earlier in his career, he is still pretty productive offensively this season, especially in comparison to 2023 when he struggled mightily.\n\nThe Yankees have a 33-4 record when Stanton and Aaron Judge hit home runs in the same game, including the postseason, according to the Associated Press. New Yankees slugger, Juan Soto, got the scoring started in the first inning with a 440-foot shot to left-center. This was the first time that the trio of sluggers hit home runs in the same game.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone previously had a clever comment when Aaron Judge and Juan Soto hit home runs in the same game in late April, saying that it was like \"hot chocolate on a cold say\", but he had no sly comment this time around.\n\n\"I don't have anything clever tonight. It was such a nice night out,\" Aaron Boone said, via Gary Phillips of the New York Daily News. \"I didn't need the hot cocoa tonight. It was perfect weather out. But that certainly puts a smile on your face when those three guys do that.\"\n\nJudge and Stanton have been paired up since 2018, but Soto was brought in to supplement and give a boost to a Yankees lineup that struggled in 2023. He has been everything that the team and fans have hoped for and more. Soto commented on the trio's performance and incidated that they believe this will be more of a common occurrence.\n\n\"I know it's not gonna be easy to do that every night, but we're really capable of doing that and more,\" Juan Soto said, via David Adler of MLB.com. \"Judge has been locked in the last couple of days. I'm really excited for that -- I can't wait to see him going crazy. It's gonna be great. And G, how hard he hits the ball, it's just amazing. You don't see guys hitting balls 120 every day.\"\n\nSoto has been great from the start, while Stanton has been solid overall as well. Judge started the season with a bit of a slump for his standard, but since last weekend's series against the Detroit Tigers has been more like his normal self, bringing his OPS on the season up to .844, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe Yankees moved to 25-13 overall with the win, and will try to get to 26-13 with a win in the final game of the series against the Astros on Thursday. New York could also drop the hated rival Astros to 12-25 overall, which would be an incredibly hard hole to climb out of.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Yankees-news-Giancarlo-Stanton-takes-MLB-lead-for-hardest-hit-ball-on-special-night-with-Aaron-Judge-Juan-Soto.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551773", "eventUri": "eng-9551773", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

What Boone didn't expect, however, was the solo homer's flight path.\n\nA rising rocket, the ball's distance didn't turn any heads. But Stanton's 118.8-mph exit velocity gave him the hardest-hit homer of the season.\n\n\"I didn't know it was going to be of the two-iron variety where it's base hit to left, 'Oops, into the bullpen,'\" Boone said after a series-opening win over the Astros. \"He's a unicorn in that way. He's weird. It's just absolutely remarkable to hit a ball at that trajectory the way he did. It's a special, special talent.\"\n\nBoone has made a habit of calling Stanton \"weird\" over the years, and he did so again on Wednesday when the designated hitter's eighth dinger of the season topped his seventh.\n\nWith Juan Soto and Aaron Judge having already homered in another win over Houston, Stanton launched a heat-seeking missile off Spencer Arrighetti in the third inning. With a 119.9-mph exit velo, Stanton recorded the hardest-hit knock of any kind this season, surpassing a 119.2-mph single that Shohei Ohtani hit in late April.\n\nThis time, the solo homer traveled 447 feet before landing in the second deck in left.\n\n\"If you hit one 120, you win,\" Boone said when asked who had the most impressive home run on Wednesday.\n\nAdded Judge: \"The night before he had the hardest hit in baseball, and then he outdid himself again tonight. Just impressive.\"\n\nJudge's homer, also a third-inning solo shot, traveled 404 feet at 106.4 mph. Meanwhile, Soto went the other way in the first inning, shooting a two-run blast 440 feet at 113.4 mph.\n\nSoto's overall performance -- he recorded five RBI -- proved to be the most spectacular in Wednesday's win, but he nonetheless found himself stunned by Stanton's latest rocket.\n\n\"How hard he hits the ball, it's just amazing,\" Soto said. \"You don't see guys hitting balls 120 every day.\"\n\nEven after some down years, Stanton still has the ability to amaze when his barrel meets the ball.\n\nThat's not to say that he's back to being an MVP-caliber player after two down years in 2022 and 2023, a stretch that saw Stanton hit .200/.277/.433 while battling injuries. The 34-year-old, as of Thursday morning, was only hitting .228 with a .286 on-base percentage this season.\n\nThose aren't good numbers, but Stanton, who didn't speak following Tuesday and Wednesday's games, has stayed healthy thus far. And his eight homers were tied with Judge for second on the Yankees. His 20 RBI were tied with Anthony Rizzo for third on the team.\n\nWhile Stanton has been far from perfect, he has provided more than just a few Statcast highlights in the season's early going. Those contributions have certainly been welcomed by one of baseball's best offenses.\n\n\"It's been fun to watch him do his thing this year for sure,\" Judge said, \"especially trying to bounce back after last year.\"\n\nBoone said Thursday that Nick Burdi is expected to rejoin the Yankees' bullpen in Tampa on Friday.\n\nThe reliever hasn't pitched in a big league game since April 16 thanks to hip inflammation. Burdi threw in a Triple-A rehab game on Tuesday, striking out the side in his lone inning of work.\n\nThe Yankees claimed Colby White off waivers from the Rays on Thursday, but the right-handed pitcher won't impact the upcoming series in Tampa. The Yankees assigned White to Double-A Somerset.\n\nThe 25-year-old hasn't pitched above Triple-A yet. White had a 17.61 ERA over nine games there this season, but he owns a 2.83 ERA over his pro career, which began in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Stanton all homer in Yankees'...", "body": "By now, the Yankees have become accustomed to Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton crushing home runs in the same game, and it has almost always led to a win.\n\nWhen Judge and Juan Soto first homered in the same game last month, Aaron Boone said it made him feel \"warm and fuzzy.\"\n\nWednesday, Judge, Soto and Stanton all went deep in the same game for the first time and, not surprisingly, good things happened for the Yankees.\n\nOn a warm night in The Bronx, in what the Yankees can only hope was a preview of the summer to come, the trio combined for 1,291 feet of home runs to power a fifth straight win, 9-4 over the Astros.\n\nSoto clobbered a two-run, opposite-field, 440-foot home run in the first inning -- part of his three-hit, five-RBI night -- before Judge and Stanton both belted solo shots in the third, all off Astros right-hander Spencer Arrighetti.\n\nJudge's came as part of his own three-hit, three-RBI night as he continues to break out of a slow start while Stanton's came off the bat at 119.9 mph, good for the hardest-hit ball in MLB this season.\n\nIt was more than enough support for Carlos Rodon, who bounced back from his worst start of the season by giving up just two runs across 6 \u00b9/\u2083 innings while striking out seven and walking none.\n\nIn the process, the Yankees (25-13) improved to 6-0 against the Astros (12-24) this season and have now won nine straight games against them dating back to last year.\n\nBefore Wednesday, Judge and Stanton had homered in the same game twice this season, both wins, and 37 games all time in which the Yankees were 33-4.\n\nJudge and Soto had homered in the same game once and Soto and Stanton had homered in the same game once, both wins.\n\nFor Judge, it marked the latest encouraging sign that he is leaving his early-season slump behind him.\n\nBesides his second home run in his last three games and fifth in his last 14, Judge added a pair of doubles, the second driving in a pair of runs to break the game open at 8-1 in the sixth inning.\n\nA night after drilling a home run that came off the bat at 118.8 mph -- which marked the hardest-hit home run in the majors this season -- Stanton one-upped himself.\n\nOn a 1-2 count, he got a 79 mph curveball over the middle of the plate and obliterated it at 119.9 mph off the bat, surpassing Shohei Ohtani (119.2) for the hardest-hit ball in the majors this season.\n\nAnd Soto followed his first-inning home run by adding a pair of RBI singles and an RBI groundout.", "source":

The numbers prove it and the home runs that Stanton has delivered in this series against the Astros at Yankee Stadium serve as an excuse to highlight the way he stands alone throughout the Statcast Era.\n\nStanton's 119.9-mph missile into the second deck in left field in Wednesday night's win over Houston was the fifth-hardest hit home run in baseball since 2015, the home run with the highest exit velocity in the league this season.\n\nNobody has hit a home run at a higher exit velocity than Stanton in the Statcast Era. His 121.7-mph blast against the Rangers at Yankee Stadium on August 9, 2018 is still the hardest-hit homer tracked by Statcast. The 121.3-mph rocket that Stanton crushed to left at Nationals Park in Game 2 of the COVID-shortened season (July 25, 2020) is second on that blazing list. Braves star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. (121.2 mph on Sept. 2, 2023) and Stanton's bash brother Aaron Judge (June 10, 2017) account for the rest of that exclusive leaderboard.\n\nFor reference, there have only been 18 batted balls in play hit harder than 120 mph in the Statcast Era and 14 of them came off Stanton's bat. Stanton has swatted two of the three batted balls over 122 mph.\n\n\"You don't see guys hitting balls 120 [mph] everyday!\" Juan Soto said after watching Stanton's sizzler on Wednesday night.\n\n\"He's staying through the baseball well, using the whole field,\" Judge added. \"When he's using the whole field, that's when I know that he's locked in. So it's been fun to watch him do his thing this year for sure, especially trying to bounce back after last year.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Stanton lined a 118.8-mph home run into the visiting bullpen in left. It was his 11th home run tracked by Statcast that had a launch angle below 16 degrees.\n\n\"I actually walked over to [bench coach Brad] Ausmus right before that pitch and I said he's going deep right here,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said that evening. \"I didn't know it was going to be of the two-iron variety where it's a base hit to left and oops, into the bullpen. He's a unicorn in that way. He's weird. It's just absolutely remarkable to hit a ball at that trajectory the way he did.\"\n\nAsked on Wednesday what Stanton's latest stinger would be characterized as, Boone smiled.\n\n\"I don't know, just weird,\" he said. \"Hashtag weird.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Acu\u00f1a_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XBWABPLVN5BITOMPJRRON2SKEU.jpg?auth=2f9ebe1ca63c8a090a143a1eed7a03294ff510db6c91f1b0791ce1e4ba569078&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551773", "eventUri": "eng-9551773", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-08-09", "textStart": 1461, "textEnd": 1475}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-25", "textStart": 1637, "textEnd": 1650}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-10", "textStart": 1783, "textEnd": 1796}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

From Aaron Judge to Gunnar Henderson, 22 players are averaging more than 93 miles per hour on their batted balls. When they hit it hard, good things happen. Sometimes, those good things are home runs that, thanks to that exit velocity, leave the yard in a hurry.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Shohei Ohtani finds himself on this list. He is in rare company when it comes to exit velocity; he is currently ranked third among all MLB hitters in average exit velocity.\n\nHis 118.7-mile-per-hour blast is the 14th-hardest hit home run of all time and the third-hardest this season. Swings like that are what the Los Angeles Dodgers were looking for when they signed him for $700 million. He's not pitching this year, but he is making a huge impact on the ball from the plate.\n\n2) Giancarlo Stanton - 118.8 mph\n\nGiancarlo Stanton's drilled a home run on May 7 against Justin Verlander. It was briefly the hardest-hit home run of the season by just a hair. His 118.8-mile-per-hour blast sent Yankee Stadium into a frenzy as the Yanks poured it on Verlander and got a blowout win over their heated rivals.\n\nHe wasn't the only Yankee to blast Verlander (Alex Verdugo started the party), but he hit him harder than anyone had been hit for a home run this season. It just didn't stay that way for long.\n\n1) Giancarlo Stanton - 119.9 mph\n\nGiancarlo Stanton helped the Yankees obliterate the Houston Astros for a second-straight game by obliterating a baseball. He hit the hardest ball of the entire season.\n\nHis home run came off the bat at a sizzling 119.9 miles per hour and traveled out of the park (447 feet) in a hurry. It put a major dent in Houston's comeback plans and probably a dent in the stands as well.\n\nHe topped himself for the hardest-hit homer and, in the process, set the bar for all batted balls in 2024.

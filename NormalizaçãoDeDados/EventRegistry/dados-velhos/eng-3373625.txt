The city of Sisters and Black Butte Ranch are not affected by the evacuation orders.\n\nA Red Cross evacuation shelter is set up at Sisters Middle School, and a pet evacuation team is housing pets and livestock at the Sisters Rodeo grounds.\n\nAt 6 p.m. Saturday, a community meeting is scheduled at Sisters High School to update residents on the fire, and answers questions.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters are working Saturday to cut new containment lines between the edge of the fire and the threatened communities. Fire crews with the Oregon Department of Forestry and Deschutes National Forest are being assisted by task forces from the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office, which is helping to protect and evacuate neighborhoods.\n\nFire officials warned that drones flying in the area could ground aircraft that are helping fight the fire. A temporary flight restriction is in place barring drone flights. Three heavy air tankers and one very large air tanker have made repeated drops of fire retardant in inaccessible areas of the fire. In addition, three helicopters are deployed for the fire and two National Guard helicopters on standby.\n\nMcKenzie Pass Highway -- state Highway 242 -- east of Cascade Crest to the junction of Forest Road 15 is closed.\n\nAs the Milli Fire continues to burn near Sisters, fire crews are making progress on the 66,003-acre Nena Springs Fire that gained more than 19,000 acres in two days.\n\nEvacuation orders have been lifted in the area. However, the residents in Charley Canyon, Webster Flat Road, South Junction, Culpus Bridge and Wolf Point Subdivision, are being told to be ready for another evacuation on a moment's notice.\n\nThe Kah-Nee-Ta Resort & Spa is also being warned about a potential evacuation.\n\nFire crews are focused Saturday on keeping the fire west of the Deschutes River, south of Highway 216, east of Highway 26 and north of BIA Road 3, according to Warms Springs Wildland Fire Management.\n\nThe Deschutes River is open to rafters, but Bureau of Land Management river rangers will stop rafters if a helicopter flies in to gather water from the river. Smoke from the fire may become visible Saturday over the river.\n\nAll roads in the area are open, expect Webster Flat Road.\n\n-- Reporter: 541-617-7820,\n\nkspurr@bendbulletin.com\n\n17999845", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373625", "time": "19:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373625", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233801", "label": {"eng": "Black Butte Ranch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Butte_Ranch,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Black Butte Ranch"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "234247", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "score": 1}, {"id": "305238", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Aerial firefighting"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_firefighting", "score": 2}, {"id": "305466", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "River"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "score": 1}, {"id": "324545", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fire retardant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_retardant", "score": 2}, {"id": "327768", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Land Management"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management", "score": 1}, {"id": "349211", "label": {"eng": "Deschutes River (Oregon)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschutes_River_(Oregon)", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "361355", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Deschutes National Forest"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschutes_National_Forest", "score": 3}, {"id": "381629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oregon Department of Forestry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Department_of_Forestry", "score": 3}, {"id": "812068", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Temporary flight restriction"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Regulations#Temporary_flight_restrictions", "score": 2}, {"id": "977548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kah-Nee-Ta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kah-Nee-Ta", "score": 2}, {"id": "1012096", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cascades (ecoregion)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascades_(ecoregion)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1122562", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "McKenzie Pass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Pass", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.bendbulletin.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=VyI5li6TG0ku4IkrceUw6c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuOEB4jFFc76pYg_NSZdh86WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "timeCrawl": "19:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Evacuations continue as Milli Fire grows", "originalArticle": null}

This area includes the Crossroads Subdivision and homes off of Edgington Rd and Remuda Rd. These areas were previously Level 1.\n\nLevel 2: Means \"BE SET\" to evacuate. You must prepare to leave at a moment's notice. This level indicates there is significant danger to your area, and residents should either voluntary relocate to a shelter or with family and friends outside of the affected area, or if choosing to remain, to be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice. Residents MAY have time to gather necessary items, but doing so is at their own risk. This may be the only notice you receive. Emergency services cannot guarantee that they will be able to notify you if conditions rapidly deteriorate. Area media services will be asked to broadcast periodic updates.\n\nA Level 1 (BE READY) Pre-Evacuation notice is issued for the following areas:\n\nAll areas between Highway 242 and Highway 20 from the Cold Springs Campground to the city of Sisters, which includes the Tollgate Subdivision. This notification does not include the city of Sisters or Black Butte Ranch.\n\nLevel 1: Means \"BE READY\" for potential evacuation. Residents should be aware of the danger that exists in their area, monitor emergency services websites and local media outlets for information. This is the time for preparation and precautionary movements of persons with special needs, mobile property and (under certain circumstances) pets and livestock. If conditions worsen, emergency services personnel may contact you via an emergency notification system.\n\nThis decision was made after consultation with fire managers. We will continue to work with fire managers to ensure public safety and prevent conflicts between citizens and fire operations. We appreciate the cooperation and understanding of residents.\n\nThe Red Cross will be opening a shelter at the Sisters Middle School for residents that have been affected by the Milli Fire.

The Oregon Department of Transportation has closed Oregon 242 because of the fire, and one additional subdivision remained under a Level 1 (get ready) evacuation notice Saturday afternoon.\n\nBecause of the fire's threat to people and property, firefighting officials have ranked it the nation's top priority for resources and crews. A map showing evacuation zones can be found on Deschutes County's website.\n\nThe blaze is moving east and producing a large column of smoke, fire information officer Susie Heisey said Saturday afternoon. Officials are using a lot of aviation resources in an effort to stop its advance, she said.\n\nSisters-area resident Jim Monroe, 69, and his wife moved to the Crossroads subdivision two years ago, choosing the community as retirement community after both held jobs in Kenya. Anticipating Friday's evacuation order, they left their home on Thursday.\n\n\"We love central Oregon,\" Monroe said, while driving to Portland to visit children and grandchildren. \"When we lived in an area with abject poverty (Kenya) and with people who have nothing, losing belongings in a forest fire is a real First World issue.\n\n\"We don't want to lose anything...but we're trying to keep this thing in balance.\"\n\nThe couple left their house with important papers and their dogs. They expect to spend most of their time away from Sisters with releatives in Salem. That is also where they will view the eclipse on Monday, dropping plans to have family gather and viewing at their Sisters home.\n\nShortly before noon Saturday, authorities closed Forest Road 16 leading from Sisters to popular outdoor recreation areas south. As a result, the Three Creeks Campground, which was not threatened by the fire, was evacuated of what a spokesperson called a \"minimal\" number of campers.\n\nThere is a community meeting at 6 p.m. Saturday at Sisters High School. Representatives of the incident management team and local agencies will be there to provide the latest information on the fire and answer questions.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nUmpqua North Complex: The Douglas County Sheriff's Office on Saturday afternoon issued a Level 1 (Get Ready) evacuation notice for the Susan Creek residential area the BLM Susan Creek Campground. This covers the area on HWY 138 East from Mile Marker 28 to the Forest Service/BLM Boundary. Residents living on Moore Hill Lane already were under a Level 2 \" Be Set\" evacuation notice due to significant wildfire danger in the area. The fire started Friday, Aug. 11, 50 miles east of Roseburg and covers 3,532 acres.\n\nNena Springs Fire: Warm Springs Law Enforcement officers reduced the Kah-Nee-Ta Resort evacuation notice from Level 3 to Level 1, allowing resort visitors to use Highway 3. The resort remains open.\n\nCharley Canyon, Webster Flat Road, South Junction, Culpus Bridge, and Wolf Point Subdivision were also reduced to a Level 2. All roads except Webster Flat are open.\n\nLighter wind Saturday is expected to slow fire growth. High temperatures will create dryer conditions. In the last two days, the fire has gained just over 19,000 acres, bringing the fire's total to 66,003 acres.\n\nFirefighters are now working to keep the fire west of the Deschutes River; south of Highway 216; east of Highway 26, and north of BIA Road 3. They are also working to keep it out of Beaver Creek Canyon.\n\nChetco Bar Fire: The Curry County Sheriff's Office has issue a Level 3 (Go) evacuation order for the Alfred Loeb State Park on the south coast near the Oregon-California border, Gardiner Ridge Road up to Hazel Camp area, Cate Road, and the Wilson Creek area.

The total number of displaced people is most likely 10 times as many, but most opt to stay with nearby family or friends instead of sleeping on cots in a school gym, said Alaina Mayfield, Red Cross disaster program manager for Central and Eastern Oregon.\n\n\"We were shooting to be prepared for at least 40 people,\" Mayfield said.\n\nA group of 10 people and three dogs driving from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Lincoln City for Monday's solar eclipse pulled into the Sisters Middle School parking lot shortly after 7 p.m.\n\nThe group had made a camping reservation two months ago at the only open lot on a campground just outside of Sisters along state Highway 242, only to find the road closed and blocked by law enforcement officers with flashing lights, Salt Lake City resident Michelle Lener said.\n\n\"Now we're trying to find somewhere to stay,\" she said.\n\nOne of the eclipse travelers, Jason Smurthwaite, said he checked on fires and road closures about a week before the trip and was watching updates on the Milli Fire during the day Friday.\n\n\"I could see it growing and growing,\" he said.\n\nThe fire, burning 6 miles west of Sisters and about 1\u00bd miles southwest of Black Crater Lake since Aug. 11, grew dramatically overnight Wednesday from 260 to 4,565 acres in the Three Sisters Wilderness. By Friday night, officials estimated it had burned 7,000 acres. About 600 people have been evacuated.\n\nPaul Tinsley, 42, who lives with his wife and their four boxers in a tent near Elm Street, said he learned how bad the fire was late Friday evening when a police officer told him he had to leave immediately.\n\n\"I told him, 'You're asking me to leave everything I have, which other people might come by and pillage,'\" Tinsley said. \"He said, 'It's your stuff or your life.'\"\n\nThis is the second time Tinsley has had to evacuate for a fire -- he lost everything he owned several years ago in a wildfire near Spokane, Washington. The Missouri native relocated to California briefly after that, but has been living in Sisters for more than a year. Fire danger is a small price to pay for the town's proximity to the Pacific Crest Trail, he said.\n\nSisters resident Ryan Seeley sat in his pickup truck in the middle school parking lot, with Tinsley's four dogs -- Joker, Violet and their puppies Junior and Molly -- licking at his face and a flat trailer behind the truck ready to help whoever else he could.\n\n\"It's scary,\" he said. \"All I can think about are the people in the rural areas.\"\n\nSeeley said he's come across plenty of fires while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, but none has been quite as large or uncontained as the Milli Fire. People he knows are starting to leave, and he said his wife, who works at the city's parks and recreation department, told him parents had been taking their kids from summer camp and leaving town.\n\n\"I've done a lot of hikes near wildfires,\" Seeley said. \"I've seen a lot of fires, but I've never seen a fire like this. Seeing it up in flames right now and threatening our little town, it's scary.\"\n\nTinsley and his wife could stay at the middle school, which was set up with cots, showers, a 24/7 snack table and meals provided by the Salvation Army, but their four dogs had to sleep several miles away, at the Sisters rodeo grounds.\n\nSix dogs, two cats, two horses and a box turtle had been checked into the pet and animal evacuation center by Friday night, said Jamie Kanski, regional coordinator for Pet Evacuation Team. She anticipates more livestock arriving and has spots ready for them as well.\n\nPets come in with their owners and pose for pictures as part of their intake. Then they're separated into their own areas, with dogs in individual kennels, cats and the box turtle's aquarium in a trailer and horses and livestock in corrals. An audible keening came from one dog kennel as Pet Evacuation Team volunteers took down information about Tinsley's dogs.\n\n\"It's very stressful for them being away from their owners and with all the smoke, so we just try to get them settled,\" Kanski said. \"It's very hard on the owners, too. They're under so much stress being evacuated and away from their homes.\"\n\nBack at Sisters Middle School, the Utah crew received permission to set up their tents and campers in the grass near the gym before heading on toward the Oregon Coast on Saturday morning. They had just finished putting up tents when the school's sprinklers turned on, drenching their makeshift camp with water desperately needed a few miles west.\n\n-- \u2009Reporter: 541-633-2160;

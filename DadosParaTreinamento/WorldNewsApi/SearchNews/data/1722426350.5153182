In a recent contribution about displaying the Ten Commandments in schools, David Herlich states, \u201cLouisiana enthusiastically passed a law designed to convert every schoolchild in the state to Christianity.\u201d He then built on that wobbly foundation by asking, \u201cI wonder how people would feel if the Quran was required to be posted in large font in every classroom?\u201d That\u2019s clearly apples to oranges. If I were in a country where the Quran was a major cornerstone of its very existence, I would certainly expect and accept references to it in public places. I would not see it as trying to convert me to anything at all. California\u2019s state education code says, \u201cNothing in this code shall prevent, or exclude from public schools, references to religion, or to literature or displays having religious significance.\u201d Why not more, not less, displays of our national heritage?

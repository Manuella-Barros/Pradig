We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement.\"\n\nThe USDA said it is also injecting a \"virus surrogate\" into ground beef and then cooking it at different temperatures, to see how much virus is killed under each heat setting.\n\nAs well, \"we recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature,\" which kills germs in meat, the agency added.\n\nNo live virus in dairy products\n\nThe U.S Food and Drug Administration also announced Wednesday that it had found no sign of live H5N1 virus in a wide variety of dairy products, such as cottage cheese and sour cream. A total of 297 pasteurized retail dairy products were tested.\n\nU.S. health officials have already been testing retail milk samples for live bird flu virus, and none has been found in any of the first batch of samples tested, federal health officials said Friday.\n\nThose early findings should reassure the public that the milk sold in stores remains safe, officials added.\n\nIn the online update, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the initial test findings likely mean the pasteurization process is killing the virus.\n\n\"These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the agency wrote, but testing efforts are continuing.\n\n\"The FDA is further assessing retail samples from its study of 297 samples of retail dairy products from 38 states,\" the agency added. \"All samples with a PCR-positive result are going through egg inoculation tests, a gold standard for determining if infectious virus is present.\"\n\n\"These important efforts are ongoing, and we are committed to sharing additional testing results as soon as possible,\" the FDA added.\n\nFDA officials also tested infant and toddler formulas, which used powdered milk, and did not find any evidence of the virus, the agency noted.\n\nTough to control\n\nThe story is different when it comes to viral fragments of bird flu: genetic bits of the virus have been discovered in roughly 20% of retail milk samples tested in a national survey, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week.\n\nThat earlier finding suggests bird flu has spread far more widely among dairy cows than officials first thought.\n\nSamples from parts of the country that have infected dairy herds were more likely to test positive, the agency noted, and regulators stressed there is no evidence yet that cow milk poses a danger to consumers.\n\nStill, 36 herds across nine states have been confirmed to have been infected with bird flu, also known as H5N1.\n\n\"It suggests that there is a whole lot of this virus out there,\" Richard Webby, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told the New York Times.\n\nWhile it is still possible to eradicate bird flu from the nation's dairy farms, Webby noted it is hard to control the outbreak without knowing its full scope.\n\nTo that end, the USDA announced last week that it is now requiring mandatory testing of dairy cows moving across state lines. Before that, testing of cows had been voluntary and focused on cows with obvious symptoms of illness.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 23 people had been tested for the virus, while 44 people were being monitored after exposure to H5N1, the Times reported. Just one human infection has been reported so far, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nStill, sustained spread among cows would give the virus more chances to become more transmissible among humans.\n\nExperts believe pasteurization, in which milk is briefly heated, should kill the virus.\n\n\"And when you destroy the virus, it's going to release genetic material,\" Samuel Alcaine, a microbiologist and food scientist at Cornell University in New York, told the Times.\n\n\"It's not surprising\" to find them in milk, he added. \"It doesn't mean that the milk is not safe.\"\n\nDisclaimer: Statistical data in medical articles provide general trends and do not pertain to individuals.

We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement.\"\n\nThe USDA said it is also injecting a \"virus surrogate\" into ground beef and then cooking it at different temperatures, to see how much virus is killed under each heat setting.\n\nAs well, \"we recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature,\" which kills germs in meat, the agency added.\n\nNo live virus in dairy products\n\nThe U.S Food and Drug Administration also announced Wednesday that it had found no sign of live H5N1 virus in a wide variety of dairy products, such as cottage cheese and sour cream. A total of 297 pasteurized retail dairy products were tested.\n\nU.S. health officials have already been testing retail milk samples for live bird flu virus, and none has been found in any of the first batch of samples tested, federal health officials said Friday.\n\nThose early findings should reassure the public that the milk sold in stores remains safe, officials added.\n\nIn the online update, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the initial test findings likely mean the pasteurization process is killing the virus.\n\n\"These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the agency wrote, but testing efforts are continuing.\n\n\"The FDA is further assessing retail samples from its study of 297 samples of retail dairy products from 38 states,\" the agency added. \"All samples with a PCR-positive result are going through egg inoculation tests, a gold standard for determining if infectious virus is present.\"\n\n\"These important efforts are ongoing, and we are committed to sharing additional testing results as soon as possible,\" the FDA added.\n\nFDA officials also tested infant and toddler formulas, which used powdered milk, and did not find any evidence of the virus, the agency noted.\n\nMore from this section Santa Cruz County Health News: Frequent Vaping in Teens Linked to Increased Metal Exposure.

Doctor Explains\n\nTough to control\n\nThe story is different when it comes to viral fragments of bird flu: genetic bits of the virus have been discovered in roughly 20% of retail milk samples tested in a national survey, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week.\n\nThat earlier finding suggests bird flu has spread far more widely among dairy cows than officials first thought.\n\nSamples from parts of the country that have infected dairy herds were more likely to test positive, the agency noted, and regulators stressed there is no evidence yet that cow milk poses a danger to consumers.\n\nStill, 36 herds across nine states have been confirmed to have been infected with bird flu, also known as H5N1.\n\n\"It suggests that there is a whole lot of this virus out there,\" Richard Webby, a virologist and influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told the New York Times.\n\nWhile it is still possible to eradicate bird flu from the nation's dairy farms, Webby noted it is hard to control the outbreak without knowing its full scope.\n\nTo that end, the USDA announced last week that it is now requiring mandatory testing of dairy cows moving across state lines. Before that, testing of cows had been voluntary and focused on cows with obvious symptoms of illness.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 23 people had been tested for the virus, while 44 people were being monitored after exposure to H5N1, the Times reported. Just one human infection has been reported so far, in a dairy worker in Texas who had direct contact with sick cows. The case was mild.\n\nStill, sustained spread among cows would give the virus more chances to become more transmissible among humans.\n\nExperts believe pasteurization, in which milk is briefly heated, should kill the virus.\n\n\"And when you destroy the virus, it's going to release genetic material,\" Samuel Alcaine, a microbiologist and food scientist at Cornell University in New York, told the Times.\n\n\"It's not surprising\" to find them in milk, he added. \"It doesn't mean that the milk is not safe.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on bird flu.\n\nSOURCES: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, updates, May 1, April 25/26, 2024; CNN; New York Times\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nConsumers can rest assured that the H5N1 bird flu

The agency said at the time it had \"confirmed one human HPAI A(H5N1) infection that had exposure to dairy cattle in Texas that were presumed to be infected with the virus,\" adding that it was \"working with state health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms.\"\n\nEarly last week, initial testing results from the national retail milk study, which sampled 96 pasteurized milk products, showed through PCR testing that about 1 in 5 retail milk samples had tested positive for HPAI viral fragments.\n\nThis week, the agencies announced they had not detected \"any viable virus\" in a second group of test samples.\n\nSecond round of dairy product testing did not detect any viable bird flu virus, per FDA\n\n\"Today we're announcing an additional set of results from our national study of 297 total retail dairy samples. The second group represents an additional 201 samples of pasteurized retail dairy products, including cottage cheese and sour cream in addition to fluid milk,\" Prater said. \"These samples underwent acute qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) testing, as well as the same egg inoculation test, and we're encouraged that this preliminary testing also did not detect any viable virus.\"\n\nTo further ensure the safety of other milk-derived products for the youngest population, the FDA said it \"tested samples of retail powdered infant formula and powdered milk products marketed as toddler formula,\" all of which came back negative, \"indicating no detection of viral fragments or virus.\"\n\nThese additional preliminary results \"further affirm the safety of the US commercial milk supply\" as well as the efficacy of pasteurization in inactivating HPAI, the agency explained.\n\nThe FDA is continuing to test samples of pooled raw milk routed to pasteurization and processing for commercial use in order to help characterize potential virus levels that pasteurization may encounter, which will also be used to inform studies to further validate pasteurization.\n\nThe FDA, with the CDC, USDA and local health partners, is continuing surveillance of milk production, processing and pasteurization to manage the emerging disease.\n\nThe FDA also reiterated this week that it strongly advises against the consumption of raw milk and recommends that the industry not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products.\n\nFSIS ground beef inspection process amid bird flu in cattle\n\n\"We are very confident that the meat supply is safe,\" a representative from the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service said Wednesday.\n\nThe meat inspection process includes each animal being inspected before slaughter, and all cattle carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter before they go into the food supply.\n\nThe FSIS has initiated three separate sampling efforts. The first was a collection of retail ground beef from the affected state, the second tested beef muscle samples from culled dairy cows, and a third study is looking at cooking ground beef at various temperatures.\n\nHow the CDC is monitoring H5N1 bird flu, local testing of those exposed\n\nIn the course of this investigation, the CDC said Wednesday local public health partners had monitored over 100 people, and if anyone presents with symptoms, the next step is to conduct local testing.\n\nThe CDC said it is monitoring flu surveillance data, \"especially in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle or other animals for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu or conjunctivitis,\" Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said in his update Wednesday.\n\nAt this time, the CDC said it has found \"no indicators of unusual flu activity in people, which includes avian influenza.\"\n\nWhile the number of tests conducted on people locally varies day by day, Daskalakis said \"it's around 25\" currently.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to infected birds, poultry or other animals are monitored for 10 days after exposure.\n\n\"We are looking to grow H5N1 virus stock from the one human case in Texas to use for additional laboratory experiments to learn how the virus reproduces in both human and cows,\" he said, which will ultimately help the CDC \"assess the severity of illness and transmissibility of the virus under different scenarios.\"\n\nIn addition to laboratory testing, the CDC is continuing with outreach and education through public health partner organizations \"to ensure preparedness for any potential human infections or exposures.\"\n\n\"CDC is conducting broad outreach to the public to raise awareness about the current situation and and remind everyone that the current risk to the general public health is low,\" Daskalakis said.\n\nUSDA says bird flu outbreak in dairy cows likely stemmed from single spillover event\n\n\"We currently have 36 affected hers across nine states,\" said Dr. Rosemary Sifford, deputy administrator of Veterinary Services and Chief Veterinary Officer for the USDA. \"It appears that there was a single spillover event in the Texas panhandle geographic region from wild birds and to dairy cattle. The wild birds are believed to be the initial source of the infection in dairy cattle and then cattle movements spread the virus into other dairy cattle herds and then subsequently into poultry flocks.\"\n\nSifford added that of the affected herds, 10% have displayed symptoms, and the \"cattle that display symptoms generally returned to near their previous production levels after they recover from the virus, which is taking around two weeks.\"\n\nMost cows have recovered with palliative treatment with little or no associated mortality, according to the USDA.\n\nThe USDA did not provide a specific number of tests conducted on dairy cattle to date, but Sifford said she expects \"an increase in the number of tests.\"\n\n\"We're requiring any herds that are moving animals inner state to test up to 30 animals in the lot that they expect to move. Once we reach 30 that's a statistically significant number to be able to determine the status of the lot,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraloregon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralOregon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Safety_and_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food Safety and Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sour cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cottage cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2024/05/02105000/GETTYRF_3123_ShoppingCartGroceries2028129986991.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The presence of genetic fragments of the virus in milk was not unexpected, since the pasteurization process generally does not remove genetic material.\n\nLast week's findings prompted researchers to perform a more sensitive test to validate that pasteurization kills H5N1 in milk samples. In those tests, they extracted the viral fragments and tried to grow the virus in fertilized eggs -- which is known as the gold-standard method for detecting active, infectious viruses. The virus did not grow, confirming that it was not active.\n\nFor weeks, key federal agencies have expressed confidence in the safety of the commercial milk supply. The FDA has pointed to data showing that pasteurization inactivates other viruses and that the pasteurization process for eggs -- which occurs at a lower temperature than what is used for milk -- deactivates the highly pathogenic avian influenza. But experts had called on the agency to back up that claim with new data.\n\nThe effort to reassure the public that the milk supply is safe underscores the vast unanswered questions about the virus, which has never before been seen in U.S. dairy cattle. A highly virulent bird flu was first detected in cows in Texas and Kansas in late March, and is known to have spread to 36 total herds and seven other states. On April 1, federal officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas was being treated for H5N1, marking only the second human case in the United States. The worker has recovered.\n\nSince then, federal agencies and experts have been racing to learn more about how the virus is spreading, when it first jumped to dairy cows and how prevalent H5N1 is in herds. Until this week, testing for the bird flu in dairy herds was voluntary, hindering the country's ability to assess the virus's spread.\n\n\"In some ways, we're going to have to catch a break and invest a lot of effort and money if we want to drive H5N1 out of the cattle population now that it's had these months to become established,\" said Michael Worobey, a University of Arizona virologist who led a team of scientists who analyzed 239 genetic sequences of the virus. He estimated the bird flu began circulating in dairy cattle some time between November and mid-January.\n\nTo date, no H5N1 infections have been reported in beef cattle,and the Agriculture Department has received no reports of symptoms in beef herds, Marissa Perry, spokeswoman for the agency, wrote in an email Tuesday. At a scientific symposium on H5N1 hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) last week, a top USDA official said beef cattle are at lower risk because they are not kept in as close quarters as dairy cows, which are often kept in more confined spaces and share food and water sources.\n\nThe USDA has expressed confidence that the meat supply is safe but is seeking to verify this through additional studies that include sampling ground beef at retail stores in the states where dairy cattle have tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu.\n\nSo far, the outbreak has had minimal impact on international trade. Colombia is the only country known to have put import restrictions on U.S. beef.\n\nEpidemiologists and industry experts worry about the virus potentially spreading to more animals. On some of the earliest affected dairy farms in Texas and Kansas, cats also became sick and died after being fed colostrum and milk from affected cows. The USDA began surveillance of wild pigs several months ago; ongoing testing of domestic swine for influenza would also pick up this bird flu strain, chief veterinary officer Rosemary Sifford said at a symposium last week.", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sour cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cottage cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/nwa_redesign/graphics/adgog.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 2200, "textEnd": 2207}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

But the agency's scientists ran into roadblocks investigating a human case of this \"pandemic potential\" virus this year, they said in a new report.\n\nEpidemiologists from the agency were ultimately unable to access a Texas dairy farm where a human was infected with the virus in March, they disclosed in attachments to the report published Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine. That prevented investigators from being able to investigate how workers might have been exposed to the virus on the farm.\n\nThat is because the dairy worker who came to a Texas field office for testing \"did not disclose the name of their workplace,\" said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThey also were unable to collect follow-up samples from the dairy farm worker or their contacts, which could have revealed missed cases as well as tracking the virus and antibodies against it in the body after an infection.\n\nThe worker did not wear protective eye goggles or a face mask that could have protected them from the virus, the report said. The virus was likely transmitted through their contaminated hands or droplets of the virus from sick cows.\n\nH5N1 was likely spreading through dairy farms via the high concentrations of the virus found in the raw milk of infected cows, authorities said previously.\n\nThe virus had been circulating in cows for an estimated four months before it was confirmed by labs on March 25, according to a draft report from U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists released Thursday.\n\nA mutation to the virus in wild birds, a specific \"clade\" of the virus that scientists call 2.3.4.4b, appears to have enabled bird flu to jump into cows. Multiple herds were likely infected during that initial spillover before the birds migrated north, officials have said.\n\nSince then, at least nine states have detected cow infections from the virus. Cows largely recover from H5N1, unlike the mass die-offs seen in other species. Some herds with infected cows have also remained asymptomatic and are continuing to produce milk.\n\nExperiments run by the Food and Drug Administration show that pasteurized milk remains safe to drink, despite traces of the virus found in samples from grocery stores. The outbreak has also prompted a renewed warning not to drink raw milk, which has been linked to deaths of other animals like cats.\n\nThe ongoing outbreak is also in stark contrast to how the virus has spread in other mammals infected by the virus, which have generally resulted in what USDA scientists called \"dead end hosts.\"\n\nA handful of variants with potentially worrying mutations have also since been spotted in cows, the USDA analysis found. If those variants become dominant, it could change the disease caused by H5N1 or make spread to other animals or humans more likely.\n\nThe virus from cows has also been spotted spreading out of dairy farms into nearby wild birds and poultry, likely ferried by contaminated milk droplets and surfaces.\n\nQuestions also remain about the exact origins of the virus that infected the Texas dairy worker. While the H5N1 sequence from the human case is closely related to those found in dairy herds, the agency's analysis found it also differs in some key ways.\n\nThose genetic differences suggest the human was infected by \"an early, slightly different virus\" that was circulating in cows before the current cases, or that multiple spillovers may have actually occurred.\n\nWhile sequences collected from sick cows on the worker's dairy farm could have helped CDC scientists answer those questions, samples were \"not available for analysis.\"\n\nThe human worker has since recovered after their bird flu infection. They only developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye, without fever or other common flu symptoms. The worker and their contacts were given oseltamivir, an antiviral treatment for bird flu that could also head off infections.\n\n\"While acute conjunctivitis is a clinically mild illness, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses, including those belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in infected humans worldwide,\" the report co-authored by CDC scientists said.\n\nReports by a local veterinarian that other workers on Texas dairy farms had symptoms of flu or conjunctivitis are true, said Anton on April 30.\n\nBut at least some of those workers with symptoms were tested and turned out to be negative for H5N1, health officials in Texas as well as neighboring New Mexico told CBS News.\n\n\"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure that there were people sick with other respiratory viruses working on dairy farms,\" Anton said in a statement..\n\nWith health authorities and experts dependent on dairy workers and their contacts volunteering for monitoring their symptoms and getting tested, those tracking the virus have turned to other data sources to look for signs of undetected spread.\n\nOne draft study of wastewater samples in a northwest Texas town found that signs of H5N1 have surged in sewers, but also that emergency room trends in the area were declining at the same time. They hypothesized dumping of waste from dairy farms with sick cows are to blame, not sick humans.\n\nThe CDC has also pointed to emergency room data for reassuring worries about undetected H5N1 cases.\n\n\"We continue to monitor flu surveillance data, especially in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle or other animals, for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu, or conjunctivitis. CDC flu surveillance systems at this time show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people,\" Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/03/31/f1ca414a-bcbb-4baf-8bc5-7385bebd1aab/thumbnail/1200x630g4/f1368b81c99c41e416f2206c864d3afd/ap17023711999843.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1572, "textEnd": 1580}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 4454, "textEnd": 4462}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

On April 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported that the agency had detected genetic material from the bird flu virus -- a form of H5N1 -- in the commercial milk supply.\n\nPasteurization has been effective at inactivating the H5N1 bird flu virus, and the viral material found in the milk has not proven to be infectious. According to the FDA, \"these results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nHowever, widespread appearance of the viral genetic material in grocery store milk indicates that the virus is likely more prevalent in cows than cow testing data indicate. The virus has been detected in dairy milking cattle in 36 herds in nine states, according to the USDA, and has been spreading among cows, both within herds and between herds as cows are transported.\n\nSince the beginning of the cow outbreak, only one person in the U.S., a dairy worker in Texas, has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The virus, found in wild birds around the world, has not shown the ability to spread among humans in a sustained way.\n\nThe World Health Organization currently evaluates the overall public health risk from H5N1 bird flu as low, adding that the risk is low to moderate for people exposed to \"infected birds or animals or contaminated environments.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also currently rates the risk to public health as low.\n\nStill, the situation with cows has renewed concerns among infectious disease experts that H5N1 bird flu -- long regarded as a threat to humans -- has the potential to cause a pandemic.\n\n\"This is a virus that we are concerned that could cause human infection or could lead to an epidemic-type outbreak,\" Dr. Jonathan Runstadler, chair of the department of infectious disease and global health at Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, told us. \"The fact that it's getting into an agricultural animal and seems to be spreading, and that has potential implications for contamination of the food supply -- all of those are reasons to be concerned about influenza and the possibility of spillover of influenza into humans.\"\n\nBut \"right now really it's more of an animal health issue,\" Dr. Andrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, told us. \"Certainly, keeping an eye towards public health, but with only one reported case in humans, and there's been a growing number of animal detections and we haven't seen the uptick in human detections, I think that's probably a good sign for public health.\"\n\nBelow, we've assembled answers to some basic questions about H5N1 bird flu.\n\nThe H5N1 bird flu virus likely passed to dairy cows from wild birds -- perhaps via contaminated food or water -- and subsequently began to spread between cows. USDA analyses, described in a May 1 preprint, indicate there was just one introduction of the virus to the cows.\n\nThe virus spreading in cows belongs to a group of H5N1 bird flu viruses that has been causing substantial disease and death in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2020.\n\nThe difference now is that it \"seems to be maintained amongst the cattle, which is a first from what we've seen in mammalian spillovers,\" Bowman said. \"The rest of them seem to have been dead-end hosts.\"\n\nWhen cows get sick with H5N1 bird flu, their milk production and appetite may decline; the milk may become thicker; and the cows may become lethargic and feverish, among other possible symptoms. Unlike birds, for which the virus can be widely lethal, the cows appear to recover from their illness. There is also evidence that some cows can carry the virus without having any symptoms.\n\nH5N1 bird flu has been detected in cats that were fed raw milk from infected cows. And cows appear to have spread the virus to poultry, wild birds and a raccoon.\n\nThe movement of cattle from herd to herd has been linked to the spread of the virus. However, it is unclear exactly how H5N1 bird flu is spreading between dairy cows, Bowman and Runstadler both said.\n\nThe learning curve has been complicated by the fact that cow influenza isn't exactly a research specialty. \"Why cows?\" Bowman said. \"Because if you'd asked probably any flu expert seven weeks ago, bovine was not a primary host of influenza.\"\n\nThe virus has been primarily found in milk and mammary tissue, according to the USDA, and milk is likely implicated in its spread. The virus has not been found in significant amounts in respiratory samples. In a presentation at an event hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials on April 25, Dr. Rosemary Sifford of the USDA said that no significant viral shedding had been found from the gastrointestinal tracts of cattle, based on limited samples.\n\nBowman called the high levels of virus in the cows' udders unprecedented. \"As we think about influenza, for the most part we think about it as an upper respiratory pathogen in most mammalian species,\" he said. However, he added that H5N1 bird flu has been more of a systemic disease than other flu types.\n\nOne theory on transmission is that contaminated milking or other dairy equipment is spreading the virus from cow to cow. Or perhaps the virus is getting aerosolized in milk and spreading between adjacent cows, or getting into the animals' feed, Runstadler said. \"There's a lot of different possibilities in a farm situation for transmission to occur through different routes,\" he said.\n\nIt is also uncertain when the virus spread to cows and how widespread it is, Bowman and Runstadler said.\n\nThere have been reports of symptoms in dairy cows dating to late January. USDA scientists estimate that the virus spread in cows for about four months before being detected in March.\n\nBowman said that the lack of a precedent for significant influenza in cattle may have contributed to the illness flying under the radar at first. \"As a veterinarian, if I had a cow with illness, I would have never requested an influenza test,\" he said.\n\nSifford said during her April 25 presentation that USDA has flu surveillance systems set up in domestic pigs and poultry, as well as feral swine. But similar systems don't exist in cows.\n\n\"This virus seems to have spilled over into dairy cattle from birds, and one of the potential reasons why we didn't notice it until now or haven't noticed it is that there isn't enough public funding that's put into surveillance for potential zoonotic disease like this,\" Runstadler said, referring to the potential for animals to spread a virus to humans.\n\nAs of May 2, the USDA has reported cases in 36 herds in nine states. But when the FDA sampled commercial milk being sold in stores, it found that 1 in 5 samples contained genetic material from H5N1. Some researchers, including Bowman, have also found genetic material from the virus in milk they bought in retail settings across various states.\n\nFarmers are supposed to discard milk from sick cows, but the findings of viral genetic material in the milk supply indicate that this isn't happening in all cases, perhaps because some cows are asymptomatic.\n\nIt's hard to tell based on commercial milk testing data exactly how many cows or even farms are affected, Bowman said. However, \"it gives us the indication that it's more widespread in the cattle herd than the reported cases so far,\" he said.\n\nAs of April 29, the USDA ordered that state veterinarians and laboratories report any positive test for influenza A -- which would include H5N1 cases -- in livestock, and that farmers get some dairy cows tested if they are going to be transported across state lines. This should likely increase testing in dairy cattle, which is otherwise left up to the discretion of the farmers.\n\nThe vast majority of milk products sold in the U.S. and all milk sold via interstate commerce is pasteurized. The available evidence shows that this family of heat treatments inactivates any H5N1 that is present.\n\n\"At this point every indication is that milk is safe to drink,\" Bowman said. \"We're just picking up viral genetic material. We're not picking up viable virus.\"\n\nThe FDA strongly recommends against consuming raw milk, which isn't pasteurized, under ordinary circumstances and has affirmed this recommendation. Researchers told STAT that this would be a particularly bad time to drink raw milk, citing the high levels of virus found in udders of infected cows, and the high levels of inactivated viral material found in commercial pasteurized milk. The FDA bans interstate raw milk sales and reports that \"20 states explicitly prohibit intrastate raw milk sales in some form and 30 allow it.\"\n\nThe FDA is looking at the effects of pasteurization on H5N1 using various methods and in various dairy products, Dr. Donald Prater of the FDA said during the April 25 presentation. FDA testing has since shown, for instance, that viral fragments in cottage cheese and sour cream are inactive. Prater also said that the FDA is evaluating H5N1 risk in aged cheese made with raw milk, which can be sold in interstate commerce.\n\nSo far, there's no evidence the virus has affected beef cattle, according to the USDA. In her April 25 presentation, USDA's Sifford said the virus likely originally spilled over from wild birds into dairy cattle due to \"the management of dairy cattle being in much more confined spaces.\" The access to feed and water in a confined space may have attracted wild birds.\n\nTherefore, when looking to see whether the virus might spread into beef cattle, it would make sense to look at a more confined setting where the birds could access food and water, such a feedlot, she said.\n\nThe USDA reported no evidence of H5N1 in 30 samples of ground beef bought in retail settings in areas where H5N1 has been reported in dairy cows. The agency has said it will also do experiments to see how different cooking temperatures might affect the virus in ground beef.\n\nWhile most beef comes from dedicated beef cattle, a small portion comes from dairy cattle. The USDA has said it will test muscle from some dairy cows that are being slaughtered.\n\nAs we have written, WHO and the CDC say the current risk to public health is low. The virus would need to undergo various changes to easily infect and replicate in humans, and to spread between them. But the circulation of H5N1 bird flu in dairy cows raises a few concerns.\n\nOne is that the cows put a new population of workers and animals in contact with H5N1 bird flu. Flu viruses trade sequences with each other, in a process called reassortment, and they also mutate over time. Contact with humans and livestock, such as pigs, may give the virus more chances to mix with other flu viruses or develop mutations that would allow it to better spread between humans.\n\n\"It's one thing to have a virus circulating out in wild birds that might be a risk,\" Runstadler said. \"It's another thing to have it in a domestic agricultural animal population if it might be a risk.\"\n\n\"Not only is this in a new host species, but then this is a different set of farm workers,\" Bowman said, explaining that pig and poultry farmers are well versed in flu protection measures but that occupational health recommendations for dairy workers have not historically included such measures.\n\nGiven that it's uncertain exactly how the cows are transmitting H5N1, it's unclear what precautions dairy workers need to take, Bowman said. But the CDC has recommended new procedures for people working in the cattle industry, particularly those exposed to infected cows.\n\nAnother concern is that H5N1 bird flu may become better adapted to mammals as it circulates in cows, which could in turn help the virus gain a foothold in people or other mammals. Researchers are monitoring H5N1 from cows to better understand if it has developed mutations \"that would suggest that it's better adapted to causing disease in a mammalian host,\" Runstadler said.\n\nVivien Dugan, director of the influenza division at the CDC, told STAT that \"we've not seen anything that would be concerning to us for mammalian adaptation, at this point.\"\n\nSo far, there aren't any signs that the virus is spreading widely among humans. The CDC has flu surveillance systems that detect influenza A, the general family of flu that H5N1 bird flu is a part of. The rate of influenza A in health care settings is decreasing as flu season ends. CDC also does surveillance for unusual subtypes of flu, and routine testing for flu should also detect if an unusual type of flu is circulating.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to know how many other cases there are beyond just the single one detected in the Texas dairy worker, Bowman said. \"I think we generally accept the idea that there are more cases than reported cases, always,\" he said.\n\n\"The H5N1 viruses that were historically responsible for that 50% case fatality rate -- this is a different version,\" Bowman said.\n\nThus far, the one American known to be infected by cows only suffered from pinkeye and recovered. The other American who got H5N1 bird flu since it began spreading among wild birds in the U.S. in late 2021 also had mild disease and recovered.\n\nCase fatality rates simply show what percentage of people known to be infected died. They don't show the percentage of the total number of infected people who die. People who are asymptomatic or only mildly ill may not get testing.\n\nFinally, it's unknown what other changes H5N1 might undergo if it did develop the ability to spread well in humans. It could become more lethal, or it could become less lethal.\n\nIf H5N1 did begin spreading between humans, some treatments and vaccines would likely be available. The CDC has confirmed that the version of H5N1 bird flu that infected the Texas dairy worker should be susceptible to available antiviral flu medications and recommends treating people who are exposed or infected with oseltamivir, otherwise known as Tamiflu.\n\nThe U.S. has a stockpile of vaccines previously developed to protect against H5 influenza viruses. The CDC says these are expected to provide some protection against the version of the virus currently spreading in cattle, should they become necessary. However, there would likely be challenges in scaling up vaccine production to vaccinate people around the world.\n\nPeople also may have some immunity to part of the virus from the H1N1 swine flu pandemic virus, as well as some vaccines, but the degree to which this would be helpful is unclear.\n\nAs we've said, the CDC recommends specific precautions for people working with livestock, including people with backyard birds, such as chickens. These include wearing appropriate gear when dealing with potentially infected animals or materials.\n\nThe CDC also recommends a few general precautions. These include keeping one's distance from wild birds and avoiding contact with substances like bird poop that could be contaminated. People should also avoid contact with sick or dead animals, whether domestic or wild, and look into policies for reporting dead birds in their area. Researchers suggest keeping pets away from animals that could be infected, including in urban areas.\n\nThe CDC also recommends following normal food safety practices, such as properly cooking poultry, eggs and beef, and avoiding raw milk and raw milk products.\n\nFinally, the agency says that it's important to get annual seasonal flu shots.

Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said researchers are not seeing changes in the virus that would indicate it might spread more easily between people. The dairy worker reported with bird flu on April 1 is the second human case of the virus reported in the U.S. The worker had conjunctivitis, a mild eye infection, and recovered.\n\nQ: What is the CDC doing to respond to the bird flu outbreak?\n\nA: Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency is looking for unusual trends in flu-like illnesses around the country and conjunctivitis -- especially in areas where H5N1 virus has been found in dairy cattle or other animals. CDC's flu surveillance systems are not showing any signs of unusual flu activity, which might indicate avian influenza.\n\nThe CDC is also supporting the monitoring of exposed workers, Daskalakis said. People who have been exposed to infected cows, poultry or other animals are monitored for 10 days and if they show symptoms of illness, they are then tested. So far over 100 farm workers have been monitored.\n\nHe said the CDC is also providing guidance for farm worker protection, which includes a graphic for recommending personal protective equipment for those who work with farm animals and that is available in English and Spanish.\n\nHe said the agency is also conducting ongoing lab work, which includes genetic sequencing. Because viruses are constantly changing, he said the CDC is continually analyzing the virus to identify any genetic changes that suggest these viruses might spread more easily to and between people or might change in a way that makes antivirals and vaccines less effective.\n\nQ: How is the virus spreading among dairy cows?\n\nA: Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said studies indicate the recent infections of dairy cattle in the U.S. was the result of one \"spillover event\" from wild birds, and that they are not finding more than that single event.\n\nThat first spillover from birds to cows occurred in Texas and took place among a number of herds, she said. Once infected cows from those herds were moved to other states, the infection spread. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds in nine states had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nSifford said the movement of cattle spreads the virus, but she also noted it can also spread through farming equipment. She said farmers with affected herds have reported about 10% of their herds displayed symptoms.\n\nShe said these cattle with symptoms \"generally\" returned to near their previous milk production levels after recovering from the virus, which is taking about two weeks. She said most cows are recovering with \"little or no associated mortality.\"\n\nQ: What dairy products have been tested for bird flu and where they purchased?\n\nLast week, the FDA announced it had done testing on 96 commercially available milk products and found genetic traces in one of five samples, but that early data showed no live virus. Donald A. Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, said Wednesday the agency had done testing of an additional 201 products, which include cottage cheese and sour cream in addition to milk, and early data found none of the samples had \"viable virus.\"\n\nSeveral samples of powdered infant formula were also tested and the results from these tests were also negative.\n\nFederal agencies expressed more concern about the possible dangers of drinking raw milk, and they once again urged people to not drink raw milk or eat raw cheese.\n\nQ: What treatments are available?\n\nThere are four commercially available FDA-approved prescription antiviral treatment drugs recommended for influenza that are effective against H5N1, according to the CDC.\n\nWhen reporters pressed CDC's Daskalakis about farm workers being given the antiviral medication Tamiflu \"prophylactically,\" to protect them from illness, he said for the workers being offered this, it's a clinical decision made on a case-by-case basis.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The statement did not provide details on how they would do so.\n\nEarlier this week, in a notice to the Canadian dairy industry, the agency said that lactating cows could no longer be imported from the U.S. without proof of negative flu tests. That change took affect April 29.\n\nH5N1 has not yet been found in cows in Canada, but some doctors and scientists worry cases may have been missed because officials have been waiting for farmers and field veterinarians to report symptoms in cattle, rather than actively hunting for the virus.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on March 25 that it had confirmed for the first time cases of highly pathogenic avian flu in cows in Texas and Kansas. The virus has since been found in 36 herds of dairy cattle in nine states, including in the border state of Michigan.\n\nFinding avian flu in cows set off alarm bells because of the threat the virus could pose to livestock, and because wider transmission in mammals could provide the virus more opportunities to evolve into a pathogen that spreads from human to human.\n\nFor now, however, public health officials say the risk to people is very low, unless they work directly with farmed or wild birds. USDA testing of retail samples of milk and milk products, such as sour cream and cottage cheese, found them to be safe because of pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill pathogens.\n\nHowever, USDA testing did turn up harmless viral fragments in one in five retail milk samples tested in April - a clue that the bird flu may be more widespread among cows than currently known. Testing retail milk in Canada could serve the same surveillance purpose.\n\nThe USDA also said this week that testing of ground beef from states with infected herds found no trace of the virus.\n\nSince 2003, nearly 900 human cases of avian flu have been confirmed in 23 countries. Just more than half were fatal, but the true fatality rate is believed to be lower because only the sickest patients come to the attention of authorities.\n\n\"We obviously have been paying very close attention to H5N1 since it was first identified in 1996 and it has not acquired a suite of mutations and mechanisms that would allow it to replicate easily in the human respiratory tract and spread from one person to another,\" said Greg Rose, an infectious disease and infection control consultant at the Queensway-Carleton Hospital in Ottawa.\n\nHowever, Dr. Rose said the risk of that happening is becoming less remote as a highly pathogenic version of the virus known as H5N1 2.3.4.4b traverses the globe, wipes out poultry and wild bird populations, and infects more types of mammals, including raccoons, skunks, red foxes, cats, dogs, sea lions and dolphins.\n\nMore than 11 million farmed birds have died or been culled since the virus was first detected in Canada in December of 2021.\n\nSo far, H5N1 2.3.4.4b is causing relatively mild illness in cows, marked by loss of appetite, a precipitous drop in milk production, lethargy and fever. No cows are known to have died of the virus.\n\nThe lone confirmed human case linked to the outbreaks was found in a Texas farmworker whose only symptom was pink eye.\n\nA new report published in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday suggested the worker may be the first detected example of avian flu transmitting from a mammal to a human. People infected with the virus in the past have had direct contact with sick birds. The Texas worker didn't, according to the report, written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Department of State Health Services.", "source": {"uri":

The statement did not provide details on how they would do so.\n\nEarlier this week, in a notice to the Canadian dairy industry, the agency said that lactating cows could no longer be imported from the U.S. without proof of negative flu tests. That change took affect April 29.\n\nH5N1 has not yet been found in cows in Canada, but some doctors and scientists worry cases may have been missed because officials have been waiting for farmers and field veterinarians to report symptoms in cattle, rather than actively hunting for the virus.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on March 25 that it had confirmed for the first time cases of highly pathogenic avian flu in cows in Texas and Kansas. The virus has since been found in 36 herds of dairy cattle in nine states, including in the border state of Michigan.\n\nFinding avian flu in cows set off alarm bells because of the threat the virus could pose to livestock, and because wider transmission in mammals could provide the virus more opportunities to evolve into a pathogen that spreads from human to human.\n\nFor now, however, public health officials say the risk to people is very low, unless they work directly with farmed or wild birds. USDA testing of retail samples of milk and milk products, such as sour cream and cottage cheese, found them to be safe because of pasteurization, the process of heating milk to kill pathogens.\n\nHowever, USDA testing did turn up harmless viral fragments in one in five retail milk samples tested in April - a clue that the bird flu may be more widespread among cows than currently known. Testing retail milk in Canada could serve the same surveillance purpose.\n\nThe USDA also said this week that testing of ground beef from states with infected herds found no trace of the virus.\n\nSince 2003, nearly 900 human cases of avian flu have been confirmed in 23 countries. Just more than half were fatal, but the true fatality rate is believed to be lower because only the sickest patients come to the attention of authorities.\n\n\"We obviously have been paying very close attention to H5N1 since it was first identified in 1996 and it has not acquired a suite of mutations and mechanisms that would allow it to replicate easily in the human respiratory tract and spread from one person to another,\" said Greg Rose, an infectious disease and infection control consultant at the Queensway-Carleton Hospital in Ottawa.\n\nHowever, Dr. Rose said the risk of that happening is becoming less remote as a highly pathogenic version of the virus known as H5N1 2.3.4.4b traverses the globe, wipes out poultry and wild bird populations, and infects more types of mammals, including raccoons, skunks, red foxes, cats, dogs, sea lions and dolphins.\n\nMore than 11 million farmed birds have died or been culled since the virus was first detected in Canada in December of 2021.\n\nSo far, H5N1 2.3.4.4b is causing relatively mild illness in cows, marked by loss of appetite, a precipitous drop in milk production, lethargy and fever. No cows are known to have died of the virus.\n\nThe lone confirmed human case linked to the outbreaks was found in a Texas farmworker whose only symptom was pink eye.\n\nA new report published in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday suggested the worker may be the first detected example of avian flu transmitting from a mammal to a human. People infected with the virus in the past have had direct contact with sick birds. The Texas worker didn't, according to the report, written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Department of State Health Services.", "source": {"uri":

Why the risk to humans remains low", "body": "A national outbreak of bird flu is spreading among dairy cows in at least nine states, but Arizona farms haven't yet detected any cases.\n\nH5N1, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, is the first to make a jump from infected birds to cattle, an event evolutionary and epidemiology experts say is \"unprecedented\" and worrisome.\n\n\"Ideally, you don't want H5N1 starting to infect whole new mammalian species that we are in contact with,\" as this could increase the risk of a mutation that also affects humans, said Michael Worobey, a genomic epidemiology expert and head of the ecology and evolutionary biology department at the University of Arizona.\n\n\"I'm not alarmed by it but it certainly has opened up a new front for these viruses that, until now, had just been bird viruses.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a national order last week to limit the spread of the virus after a farm worker in Texas was exposed to a sick cow and developed conjunctivitis, and after researchers found inactive traces of the virus in milk, USA Today reported.\n\nUnder the USDA order, all dairy cattle must be tested for avian influenza before they are moved across state lines, and labs and state veterinarians must now report all positive results in livestock.\n\nThe Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Arizona started testing last week. So far they've only received one sample, which turned out negative, said director Yan Zhang. They could perform these tests before but there weren't requests, he said. There's now funding to process the samples for free.\n\nMore data is needed to limit the virus from spreading.\n\n\"We'd like to know exactly when, where and how this jumped into cattle, so that we might be able to prevent that from happening again,\" said Worobey, one of a handful of scientists worldwide analyzing genomic data from the new strain.\n\nUSDA said it has found no changes to the virus \"that would make it more transmissible to humans\" and the current risk to the public remains low.\n\nPublic health:Four reasons to be concerned (but not freak out) about the bird flu\n\nNo known cases of avian flu in Arizona cows\n\nThe dairy cow infections began in the western Texas panhandle, where dairy farms noticed a drop in milk production after some cows stopped eating.\n\nArizona dairy farmers have been alert for two months but haven't detected sick cows, according to one dairy farmer.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Agriculture confirmed \"no reports of compatible symptomology have been reported for any Arizona livestock.\"\n\nCasa Grande Dairy Co. Farm owner Jim Boyle said his calls with dairy associations across the West became more frequent in early March: \"We went from making a call every two weeks to actually calling every week,\" and included state veterinarians across the West and government officials.\n\nIt wasn't until mid-March that they knew it was bird flu, a novel disease.\n\nArizona might have escaped infections because of the lack of imports, Boyle said. \"Our dairies generally don't have animals raised in Texas. We raise our animals here, sometimes in California.\"\n\nArizona's arid environment and lack of wetlands, where potentially infected birds could congregate, might have prevented cases too, said Robert Smook, AZDA's public information officer.\n\nThe agency tightened restrictions on imports of dairy cattle starting April 3, establishing that all dairy cows must be inspected by an accredited veterinarian and have a valid certificate not within 30 days but 10 before they move across state lines. The assessment did not require an avian influenza test, only an expert evaluation.\n\nA non-deadly 'inconvenience' for dairies\n\nCows cough and wheeze. But avian influenza is not causing any respiratory issues in dairy cattle, which is probably why it went undetected, several sources said.\n\nA cow infected with bird flu would probably lose its appetite, might be kind of constipated, and two or three days after would stop producing milk, or produce a very thick milk, Boyle explained.\n\n\"They certainly don't die,\" he said, and recover within two to three weeks, rarely needing medication. \"If you go back to the area where this started in west Texas, New Mexico and Kansas, those herds are all back. All the animals are healthy again, and they're back to normal production, and it seems to not be spreading in those areas anymore.\"\n\nIn affected states, the virus hasn't spread to the whole herd but only affected 10 to 20% of cows, he added. That means a loss in milk production overall but colleagues said it's not \"super disruptive.\"\n\n\"The concern is the human health side,\" the fact that the virus is in the cows blood, mucus and milk, he said.\n\nThat concern so far is low. Store-bought milk is safe to drink since pasteurization is effective in destroying the virus, according to consistent testing by the Food and Drug Administration. The exposed farm worker had a minor symptom, and the Centers for Disease and Control is now testing workers on dairies where cows tested positive to avian flu.\n\nAvian flu 'flying under the radar'\n\nOn April 21, USDA made public the genome sequence of the H5N1 strain, raw data that Worobey and some 25 other colleagues pulled together so they could start analyzing it.\n\n\"This was actually just a single jump into cattle in the U.S.,\" said Worobey, whose expertise, genomic epidemiology, is aimed at understanding \"the origins, emergence and control of pandemics\" like HIV and influenza.\n\nResults suggest that jump, from one bird to one cow, probably between November or January, went under the radar for months, he added. There hasn't been widespread testing and the virus has infected herds since, so the tally could be greater.\n\nBirds using dairy ponds likely transmitted the virus to dairy cows. Dead blackbirds and grackles on the farms, as well as barn cats, have tested positive.\n\nThe virus hasn't been detected in beef cattle.\n\n\"I'm hoping that it's because this really is related to milk and high loads of virus in the udders, but we don't know that yet,\" Worobey said.\n\nThe other concern is that this novel bird flu in dairy cows could become endemic, like swine flu, he added.\n\n\"We should hope for the best, plan for the worst,\" he said, \"and keep a close watch on what mutations are arising in cattle.\"\n\n2023 outbreak:Avian flu kills 10 northern Arizona condors and officials fear the virus could spread\n\nVirus was devastating to some wild birds\n\nBird flu is not uncommon but this particular strain, which emerged in Europe in 2020, was very aggressive and spread to an \"unprecedented number of countries,\" according to a scientific analysis in Nature. Birds' continental migration made it worse.\n\nBackyard birds and big poultry and egg farms were hit hard in the U.S. About 90 million chickens died or were sacrificed to stop the spread since the start of the outbreak in 2022.\n\nIn Arizona, the avian influenza outbreak had \"minimal direct impact\" on commercial poultry and egg farms, which have \"the strictest biosecurity protocols\" and really \"stepped up their game,\" said Smook with AZDA.\n\nFor some wild bird species it was \"pretty devastating,\" said Tice Supplee, director of bird conservation with Audubon Southwest.\n\nDozens of California condors died in northern Arizona from the flu in 2023. USDA approved the emergency use of a vaccine last year to protect the endangered species, which number fewer than 300 birds in the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\"The good news is that so far this year we're not seeing any outbreaks,\" Supplee said.\n\nRehabilitation centers have detected some cases in hawks and owls. In Arizona, there have only been 65 recorded cases of H5N1 in wild birds, according to USDA.\n\n\"The virus is most frequently detected in and potentially spread by waterfowl, raptors and gulls,\" said Anne Justice-Allen, Arizona Game and Fish Department wildlife veterinarian.\n\n\"Other wild birds living around these species may be affected but for the most part, the disease has not been found in songbirds and backyard birds.\"\n\nThe agency tests dead birds for the virus and has a statewide surveillance project with researchers at ASU.\n\nThe H5N1 strain is now widespread in North and South America, and \"there isn't much that can be done to contain the disease in wild birds,\" Justice-Allen said, but infection of dairy cattle can be prevented by keeping waterfowl away and restricting cattle access to wetlands.\n\n\"We don't know how the dairy cattle were infected at this time but we think it was an uncommon event or it would have happened before now. This same strain has been circulating in Europe for years.\"\n\nClara Migoya covers agriculture and water issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said researchers are not seeing changes in the virus that would indicate it might spread more easily between people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dairy worker reported with bird flu on April 1 is the second human case of the virus reported in the U.S. The worker had conjunctivitis, a mild eye infection, and recovered.\n\nWhat is the CDC doing to respond to the bird flu outbreak?\n\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency is looking for unusual trends in flu-like illnesses around the country and conjunctivitis -- especially in areas where H5N1 virus has been found in dairy cattle or other animals. CDC's flu surveillance systems are not showing any signs of unusual flu activity, which might indicate avian influenza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CDC is also supporting the monitoring of exposed workers, Daskalakis said. People who have been exposed to infected cows, poultry or other animals are monitored for 10 days and if they show symptoms of illness, they are then tested. So far over 100 farm workers have been monitored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the CDC is also providing guidance for farm worker protection, which includes a graphic for recommending personal protective equipment for those who work with farm animals and that is available in English and Spanish.\n\nHe said the agency is also conducting ongoing lab work, which includes genetic sequencing. Because viruses are constantly changing, he said the CDC is continually analyzing the virus to identify any genetic changes that suggest these viruses might spread more easily to and between people or might change in a way that makes antivirals and vaccines less effective.\n\nAdvertisementHow is the virus spreading among dairy cows?\n\nDr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said studies indicate the recent infections of dairy cattle in the U.S. was the result of one \"spillover event\" from wild birds, and that they are not finding more than that single event.\n\nThat first spillover from birds to cows occurred in Texas and took place among a number of herds, she said. Once infected cows from those herds were moved to other states, the infection spread. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds in nine states had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSifford said the movement of cattle spreads the virus, but she also noted it can also spread through farming equipment. She said farmers with affected herds have reported about 10% of their herds displayed symptoms.\n\nShe said these cattle with symptoms \"generally\" returned to near their previous milk production levels after recovering from the virus, which is taking about two weeks. She said most cows are recovering with \"little or no associated mortality.\"\n\nWhat dairy products have been tested for bird flu and where they purchased?\n\nLast week, the Food and Drug Administration announced it had done testing on 96 commercially available milk products and found genetic traces in one of five samples, but that early data showed no live virus. Donald A. Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, said Wednesday the agency had done testing of an additional 201 products, which include cottage cheese and sour cream in addition to milk, and early data found none of the samples had \"viable virus.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral samples of powdered infant formula were also tested and the results from these tests were also negative.\n\nFederal agencies expressed more concern about the possible dangers of drinking raw milk, and they once again urged people to not drink raw milk or eat raw cheese.\n\nWhat treatments are available?\n\nThere are four commercially available FDA-approved prescription antiviral treatment drugs recommended for influenza that are effective against H5N1, according to the CDC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen reporters pressed CDC's Daskalakis about farm workers being given the antiviral medication Tamiflu \"prophylactically,\" to protect them from illness, he said for the workers being offered this, it's a clinical decision made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas

Colorado was only confirmed to have H5N1 in a dairy cow after USDA had collected the samples. The spokesperson did not comment on whether beef from stores in additional states would be sampled.\n\nMore results from the department related to bird flu in beef are expected soon. Samples collected from the beef muscle of dairy cows condemned by inspectors at slaughter facilities are still being tested for the virus. The department is also testing how cooking beef patties to different temperatures will kill off the virus.\n\n\"I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement,\" Dr. Jose Emilio Esteban, USDA under secretary for food safety, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe studies come after the USDA ramped up testing requirements on dairy cattle moving across state lines last month in response to the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that was in part because it had detected a mutated version of H5N1 in the lung tissue of an asymptomatic cow that had been sent to slaughter. While the cow was blocked from entering the food supply by FSIS, officials suggested the \"isolated\" incident raised questions about how the virus was spreading.\n\nSigns of bird flu have also made its way into the retail dairy supply, with as many as one in five samples of milk coming back positive in a nationwide Food and Drug Administration survey.\n\nThe FDA has chalked those up to harmless fragments of the virus left over after pasteurization, pointing to experiments showing that there was no live infectious virus in the samples of products like milk and sour cream that had initially tested positive.\n\nBut the discovery has worried health authorities and experts that cows could be flying under the radar without symptoms, given farms are supposed to be throwing away milk from sick cows.\n\nOne herd that tested positive in North Carolina remains asymptomatic and is still actively producing milk, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services told CBS News.\n\nIt remains unclear how H5N1 has ended up in the milk supply. Don Prater, the FDA's top food safety official, said Wednesday that milk processors \"can receive milk from hundreds of different farms, which may cross state lines,\" complicating efforts to trace back the virus.\n\n\"This would take extensive testing to trace it that far,\" Bailee Woolstenhulme, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, told CBS News.\n\nWoolstenhulme said health authorities are only able to easily trace back milk to so-called \"bulk tanks\" that bottlers get.\n\n\"These bulk tanks include milk from multiple dairies, so we would have to test cows from all of the dairies whose milk was in the bulk tank,\" Woolstenhulme said.", "source": {"uri": "wtop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTOP"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's not a dire threat for most of us  --  yet", "body": "The H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows in nine states, including Texas and New Mexico, sparking questions about its threat to people. Though at least one person has contracted it, the virus has not spread from person to person.\n\nHeadlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, here's what you need to know now.\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases -- except for the sea lion infections -- appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. \"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\nAlthough at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can't lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won't happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze and breathe. As we learned in the depths of COVID-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop.\n\nThat hasn't happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus's survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds'.\n\nThe evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned.\n\nNot yet. Cow's milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless.\n\nUnpasteurized \"raw\" milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus -- in its current form -- does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does.\n\nA lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported.\n\nBut just as restricting COVID tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases.\n\nSuch limited testing won't reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle -- information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them.\n\nTo boost testing, Fred Gingrich, executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss.\n\n\"These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,\" Gingrich said. \"Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can't be sold.\"\n\nThe government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven't budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples and file paperwork. \"Tests are the least expensive part,\" he said.\n\nIf testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA's slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said.\n\nThe government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis.\n\nWaterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals or temporarily ushering them into barns. \"We should be spending on prevention,\" Pitesky said.\n\nNo one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it's positive, they send a person's sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. \"Thus far we have received 23,\" Shah said. \"All but one of those was negative.\"\n\nState health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They're checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they'll be tested.\n\nAnother way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work.\n\n\"The fact that we're four months in and haven't done this isn't a good sign,\" Worobey said. \"I'm not super worried about a pandemic at the moment, but we should start acting like we don't want it to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There are 12 infected herds in Texas. The scientists said on the preprint site bioRxiv that interstate shipment of asymptomatic cattle \"has likely played a role in the spread of HPAI within the U.S. dairy herd.\" Infected cows may shed the HPAI virus for two to three weeks, they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA said it had found no bird flu virus in 30 samples of ground beef purchased in states with infected herds. \"These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe,\" said the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The FDA says its tests show that pasteurization kills the H5N1 virus and that the milk supply is safe. The CDC says the risk to human health from the virus is low.\n\n\"Our analysis of transmission chains within the cattle B3.13 clade [virus] using a phylogenomic approach suggested unsampled transmission in late 2023 and early 2024,\" said the researchers, which would be earlier than previously known. Animal health officials identified bird flu in dairy cattle following reports of a mysterious illness among dairy herds in the Texas Panhandle in February.\n\nThe team of researchers said surveillance was essential to make sure the virus does not adapt to increase its transmissibility. There have been \"as many as five cattle-to-poultry, one cattle-to-raccoon, two cattle-to-domestic cats, and three cattle-to-wild bird transmission events\" on dairy farms, they said.\n\n\"Monitoring of cattle for HPAI will inform epidemiological risk and provide an early warning for whether this interspecies transmission event and dissemination of the viruses through the U.S. dairy cattle herd represents a future threat to human health,\" they said.\n\nDuring a teleconference on Wednesday, the USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. Rosemary Sifford, said the department's focus was on identifying infected herds and eradicating the H5N1 virus on the farm.\n\n\"We have not seen any evidence of the virus in the beef herd at this time,\" she said.\n\nTexas is both the No. 1 cattle state and a leading dairy state.\n\nSome 27 scientists, many of them USDA animal disease researchers, collaborated on the study appearing on bioRxiv.

The outbreak has grown to include 36 herds of cattle.\n\nBelow are some recent developments in the ongoing H5N1 outbreak.\n\nA dairy farm worker in Texas has also been infected -- only the second time a person in the United States has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza.\n\nAccording to new details published Friday by Timothy M. Uyeki, MD, chief medical officer in the CDC's Influenza Division, and other scientists in The New England Journal of Medicine, the worker had contact with cows showing signs of illness consistent with H5N1 infection, and testing showed a close genetic similarity between the worker's infection and viruses detected in dairy cattle in Texas.\n\nUyeki and colleagues said virus samples collected from the worker and from cattle \"maintained primarily avian genetic characteristics\" and lacked genetic changes that would affect the risk for transmission to humans.\n\nThe virus exhibited no evidence of reduced susceptibility to influenza antivirals, and its hemagglutinin -- the surface protein that binds influenza viruses to human cells -- was a good fit with viruses found in H5N1 candidate vaccines, Uyeki and colleagues reported.\n\nThe worker's only symptom was conjunctivitis. Uyeki and colleagues provided some hypotheses about the case in an appendix published with their report, including that the worker's conjunctivae could have been infected through direct contact with contaminated hands or through respiratory droplets or aerosols that contained virus from sick cows, or even through contact with a contaminated surface.\n\n\"If cow-to-human transmission occurred,\" they wrote, \"to our knowledge, this would be the first reported case of mammal-to-human HPAI A(H5N1) virus transmission reported worldwide.\"\n\nThe FDA announced last week that testing identified genetic traces of H5N1 in pasteurized cow milk samples collected from grocery stores in the U.S.\n\nThe particles were identified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing, which can detect the presence of genetic material but cannot determine if a pathogen remains intact or infectious.\n\nFor that, the FDA conducted further testing of 201 qPCR-positive retail dairy samples from liquid milk, cottage cheese and sour cream, which detected no live or infectious virus, showing that pasteurization is effective at inactivating HPAI, the FDA said this week.\n\nThe agency also tested samples of retail powdered formula and powdered milk products for viral fragments and found none.\n\n\"In addition to preliminary results released late last week on an initial set of 96 retail milk samples, these results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe agency said it will continue to test samples of pooled raw milk that has been routed to pasteurization and processing for commercial use to be used as a basis to characterize potential virus levels that pasteurization may encounter and to inform future studies validating pasteurization.\n\nBecause of the potential risks associated with consuming raw milk, the FDA continues to strongly advise against drinking or selling it.\n\nAlthough there have not been any reported human infections from consuming raw milk, a recent CDC report assessing dairy cattle and cats at farms in both Kansas and Texas showed \"fatal systemic influenza infection\" in domestic cats on the farms who were given unpasteurized colostrum and milk from affected cows.\n\nAt one north Texas dairy farm, more than half the cats became ill and died. The symptoms included neurological signs of illness and blindness.\n\n\"The cats were found dead with no apparent signs of injury and were from a resident population of 24 domestic cats that had been fed milk from sick cows,\" the authors wrote.\n\nTests of samples collected from the brains and lungs of the dead cats suggested \"high amounts of virus.\"\n\n\"The recurring nature of global HPAI H5N1 virus outbreaks and detection of spillover events in a broad host range is concerning and suggests increasing virus adaptation in mammals,\" they concluded. \"Surveillance of HPAI viruses in domestic production animals, including cattle, is needed to elucidate influenza virus evolution and ecology and prevent cross-species transmission.\"\n\nThe USDA announced the results of several studies testing the safety of the nation's beef supply.\n\nThe first study involved 30 samples of ground beef collected from retail stores in states where dairy cow herds have tested positive for H5N1. The samples were analyzed using PCR testing, which showed no virus particles were present in the beef.\n\nThe remaining studies involve testing muscle samples from culled dairy cows and cooking ground beef contaminated with an H5N1 surrogate virus at different temperatures to determine its effect on the virus. Results of those studies are forthcoming.\n\n\"USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe,\" a USDA spokesperson told Healio, describing a \"rigorous meat inspection process\" in which veterinarians from the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) \"are present at all federal livestock slaughter facilities.\"\n\n\"FSIS inspects each animal before slaughter, and all cattle carcasses must pass inspection after slaughter and be determined to be fit to enter the human food supply,\" the spokesperson said. \"While we have multiple safeguards in place to protect consumers, we recommend consumers properly handle raw meats and cook to a safe internal temperature.\"", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hemagglutinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/infectious-disease/misc/infographics/2024/05_may/idn0524birdfluupdates_graphic_01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

I had people who never missed work, miss work.'\n\nHer words echo those of other veterinarians, including one in Wisconsin -- who said they'd also heard reports of sick people on infected farms.\n\nOnly one person has tested positive for the virus this year -- a farm worker who was in close contact with infected cattle. The CDC has tested 25 others, who were all negative, and says about 100 people are under monitoring.\n\nThe above map shows states that have reported bird flu infections in cattle herds\n\nThe FDA did not reveal the brands of foods it had tested and found to contain the bird flu virus.\n\nBut it did say the statement was based on 297 dairy or cow products bought from grocery stores in nine states that were recording outbreaks in cattle.\n\nIn a separate release, the USDA also revealed the results of its testing of 30 samples of ground beef -- with none found to contain the virus.\n\nBird flu causes blindness in cats that drank infected milk\n\nAbout two dozen farm cats were stricken with H5N1 bird flu after drinking milk from infected cows, leaving some blind and killing more than half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt follows on from separate testing done last week on 96 milk samples from grocery stores, which found one in five contained the virus.\n\nOfficials also did egg inoculation tests to establish whether the virus found in the foods was still active and able to infect humans.\n\nThis is where a small amount of H5N1 particles from the products is injected into a fertilized chicken egg which is then monitored for changes that would suggest an infection, such as cell death.\n\nBut in the experiments no changes in the eggs were detected, which officials said showed the products -- although they contained fragments of H5N1 -- were still safe to eat.\n\nThe FDA says that pasteurization -- where milk is rapidly heated and cooled to kill viruses -- killed off viruses and rendered products safe to consume.\n\nOther foods such as butter, ice cream and cakes were not tested for particles of the bird flu virus.\n\nDr Donald Prater, the FDA's acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that in all cases, the virus had been killed by pasteurization and so posed no health risk.\n\nBut some scientists have raised concerns over drinking milk that could contain bird flu fragments, saying they still want to see more data.\n\nDr Rick Bright, a virologist and former director at the Department of Health and Human Services who previously raised concerns over the virus being in milk, said the initial data was 'reassuring'.\n\n'Each new piece of data continues to be reassuring for pasteurized milk products.\n\n'[But] data are preliminary with many critical experiments outstanding. And it's all a snapshot in time. As outbreak spreads to more farms, more virus can get into the system.'\n\nA total of 36 farms across nine states have reported bird flu among their cattle so far, with some experts raising concerns the outbreak may be more widespread.\n\nCattle were reported to have been lethargic and to have produced milk that was a slightly off color. The virus has been detected in their milk as well as in their lungs in previous cases.\n\nExperts say workers could be infected by H5N1 at the farms if they are in close contact with cattle that are shedding the virus.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ground beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sour cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdered_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powdered milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cottage cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant formula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inoculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/02/15/84372367-0-image-a-9_1714660485918.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

H5N1 has been detected in nine states, including Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas. The agency assessed the ground beef samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests at its National Veterinary Services Lab and determined no virus particles were present in any of the samples.\n\nHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, also known as bird or avian flu, can be transmitted by wild birds to domestic poultry and other bird and animal species, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bird flu does not normally infect humans, though sporadic infections in people have occurred.\n\nThe retail ground beef tests are one of three beef safety studies the agency is conducting following the recent H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. It is also PCR testing the muscles of dairy cows that were culled for disease at the slaughter facilities it inspects.\n\nThe USDA said its Food Safety and Inspection Service veterinarians are present at all federal livestock slaughter facilities to inspect every animal before and after it is slaughtered to determine if it is safe to enter the human food supply.\n\nThe agency will also conduct a beef cooking study using a so-called virus surrogate to see how cooking at different temperatures affects virus reduction. It recommends consumers always properly handle raw meats and cook them to a safe internal temperature to kill bacteria and viruses.\n\nThe USDA tests follow last week's FDA finding that the milk supply was safe, despite 20% of commercial milk samples testing positive for bird flu fragments.

The first infection is estimated to have been around early December, according to an analysis by the scientists.\n\nAdditionally, the scientists found that there were five incidents in which the virus was spread from cattle to poultry, one case of transmission from a cow to a raccoon, two cases of cats getting infected from cows, and three cases of wild birds getting infected from cows.\n\nThe analysis also found several cases of mutations in the virus associated with increased virulence and transmission, as well as mutations that allow the virus to adapt to infect mammals better, although all of these mutations were found infrequently in the tested cattle. However, the scientists noted that as the virus spreads more, it will give these mutations more chances to spread and develop, stressing that these should be monitored to detect whether or not they increase in frequency.\n\nOutbreaks of avian influenza have been reported among cattle and other animals on dairy farms since March.\n\nOutbreaks may have occurred among farm workers too\n\nLast month, a person who had exposure to infected cows in Texas was found to be infected with the H5N1 subtype, with conjunctivitis being their only symptom. The infected person was treated with a flu antiviral drug and recovered.\n\nWhile that person remains the only confirmed case of infection among dairy workers, health officials have expressed concerns that there may be more farm workers infected who aren't getting tested.\n\nDr. Barb Petersen, a dairy veterinarian in Amarillo, Texas, told NBC last week that several dairy workers had fallen ill with \"classic flu-like symptoms,\" including high fever, sweating at night, chills, lower back pain, upset stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea. They also suffered from conjunctivitis. These workers were not tested for H5N1 so it remains unclear if they were infected with the bird flu or another illness.\n\nPetersen told Fortune on Wednesday that she \"had people who never missed work, miss work\" on affected farms due to illness.\n\nDr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, told NBC at last week that he had also heard reports of flu-like illnesses on affected dairy farms.\n\nGregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, told NPR on Thursday that he suspects there are at least several cases of farm workers being infected with the virus, as some workers sought medical care for \"influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis\" at the same time that H5N1 was spreading on the dairy farms.\n\nIn total, about two dozen people have been tested since the outbreak began among cattle, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a CDC respiratory diseases official, said Wednesday, according to Fortune.\n\nHealth officials have called for more widespread testing, noting that there is a stigma around getting tested among many farm workers, partially due to concerns about affecting their farms. However, without widespread testing, it will be difficult for health officials and scientists to track the spread of the virus and monitor any developments in its ability to spread or cause severe illness.\n\nMeanwhile, the USDA announced on Wednesday that testing on retail ground beef had found that all the samples had tested negative, reaffirming that the commercial meat supply is safe for consumers. The USDA is conducting further tests on muscle samples from slaughter facilities and to test if cooking beef containing the virus is effective in killing the virus.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA announced on Wednesday that it had found that pasteurization is effective in killing H5N1. No live, infectious virus was found in any samples from retail dairy products.\n\nOutbreaks of bird flu continue among mammals\n\nOutbreaks of avian influenza have been increasingly reported in mammals as the virus has continued to spread around the world in the past few years.\n\nSince 2021, Europe and the Americas have been suffering from a nearly continuous outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, which has been described as \"the largest-ever\" on the three continents. The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals worldwide. Outbreaks of the virus have also become more common in Africa and Asia in the past year and have even spread to Antarctica in recent months.\n\nThe World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) noted in March that, while estimates vary, about 485 bird species and 37 mammal species have been infected with avian influenza since 2021. Only the Pacific Islands, Australia, and New Zealand have been spared from the virus.\n\n\"The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis,\" noted WOAH.\n\nSign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >>", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [],

Until now, all of these cases had come from birds - but the current outbreak in the US has seen herds of dairy farm cows infected in nine different states.\n\nNew analysis has now concluded there is \"strong evidence\" a Texas farm worker who tested positive for the H5N1 virus caught it from sick dairy cattle. It makes up one of 36 herds in the US that have so far tested positive, contributing to growing concerns that American authorities are failing to contain the spread. Testing of milk has also suggested the virus has spread far beyond the reported nine states.\n\nBird flu has a greater likelihood of adapting to a new species, and subsequently infecting humans who have made close contact, if it spreads unchecked in a domesticated mammal for a long time.\n\nThe current outbreak in the US has seen herds of dairy farm cows infected in multiple states\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine report found that the man, whose identity remains unknown, had only suffered mild symptoms. He is said to have developed conjunctivitis but did not have a fever or breathing difficulties. His lungs were also clear. The man, along with the people he lived with, were treated with antiviral drugs as a precaution, and nobody else became infected.\n\nScientists on the case, including researchers from the Centres for Disease Control, said: \"Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiological data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably virus-infected cows.\"\n\nThe World Health Organisation reports that 888 people have been infected worldwide between 2003 and the end of March this year, with 463 deaths. The highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 has already seen some mammals infected, including small numbers of foxes, seals and dolphins in the UK.\n\nIt was originally thought that the virus spread between farmed mink and within sealion colonies, before it emerged in the US in dairy cows, who were suffering from a high reduction in milk production.\n\nAround 888 people have been infected worldwide since 2003\n\nScientists believe the virus may have been spreading undetected since the start of the year, with some cows being asymptomatic. It is thought that the man became infected by an airborne virus in the milking parlour landing in his eyes, or by a virus being transferred from his hands to his eyes. While the farm worker only suffered mild symptoms, bird flu can be fatal in some humans.\n\nUS authorities say dairy products and beef are safe, and have detected viral fragments, but not active virus, in pasteurised milk.\n\nIn the UK, a risk assessment led by government scientists found the threat of a similar outbreak in dairy herds is very small, as animals are kept in different conditions and have little chance being infected by wild birds carrying the cow flu across the Atlantic.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahra_khaliq@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zahra Khaliq", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colony (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32734264.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bird-Flu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

They're recovering well. But we want to make sure, again, that we are testing folks who may have been in contact.'\n\nIt comes amid reports from veterinarians that a number of farmers working with infected cattle appear to be sick, but that they are not coming forward for testing.\n\nIt comes after America's top bird flu expert said that bird flu may be one step closer to infecting humans.\n\nThe above map shows states

that the risk to the general public was still 'low'.\n\nBut she admitted that the repeated infections in cattle suggested the virus could become endemic in the species, raising the risk of an H5N1 spillover to humans -- who have close contact with the animals.\n\nShe also warned officials were having trouble tracking infections because many farmers were not coming forward to get tested.\n\nOnly 25 people have been tested for the disease so far in relation to the outbreak in cows and 100 are under monitoring.\n\nFor comparison, among poultry workers who have been dealing with H5N1 for more than two years, the CDC has tracked more than 8,000 people for symptoms.\n\nA total of 36 dairy farms across nine states have also tested positive for the disease.", "source": {"uri":

According to the CDC, there has been a multi-state outbreak of HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu in dairy cows since March 25. These bird flu viruses have never before been discovered in cattle.\n\nOne case of HPAI A(H5N1) infection in humans was confirmed by the CDC after the patient was exposed to dairy cattle in Texas that were suspected of being infected with the virus.\n\nThe recent discovery of bird flu infections in dairy cattle has raised alarm bells among health authorities. Dr. Sifford shed light on the origins of these infections, attributing them to a single \"spillover event\" from wild birds.\n\nThe subsequent movement of infected cattle between states has contributed to the spread of the virus. However, she noted that most infected cows recover within two weeks with minimal associated mortality.\n\nRead Also: E. Coli Outbreak Linked to Organic Walnuts in 19 US States\n\nAdditionally, the FDA conducted extensive testing on 201 commercially available milk products to assess the extent of contamination in dairy products.\n\nDonald A. Prater, acting director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, revealed that while genetic traces were found in some samples, no viable virus was detected. Additional testing on dairy products, including cottage cheese, sour cream, and powdered infant formula, obtained similar results.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, federal agencies have reiterated warnings against consuming raw milk and cheese, citing potential health risks. Despite the availability of FDA-approved antiviral drugs for treating H5N1 influenza, cautionary measures remain paramount in preventing further transmission.\n\nThe discovery of bird flu infections in dairy cows marks a significant development in the ongoing battle against avian influenza. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, emphasized the importance of continued surveillance and genetic sequencing to monitor the virus's evolution.\n\nHe clarified that viruses are always evolving, and scientists are always examining them to find any genetic changes that could endanger public health.\n\nStay posted here at Tech Times.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_lopez@techtimes.com", "name": "John Lopez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sour cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/446678/820/0/0/0/virulent-strain-of-bird-flu-spreads-among-cattle-herds-in-the-u-s.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1134}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Colorado was only confirmed to have H5N1 in a dairy cow after USDA had collected the samples. The spokesperson did not comment on whether beef from stores in additional states would be sampled.\n\nMore results from the department related to bird flu in beef are expected soon. Samples collected from the beef muscle of dairy cows condemned by inspectors at slaughter facilities are still being tested for the virus. The department is also testing how cooking beef patties to different temperatures will kill off the virus.\n\n\"I want to emphasize, we are pretty sure that the meat supply is safe. We're doing this just to enhance our scientific knowledge, to make sure that we have additional data points to make that statement,\" Dr. Jose Emilio Esteban, USDA under secretary for food safety, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe studies come after the USDA ramped up testing requirements on dairy cattle moving across state lines last month in response to the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that was in part because it had detected a mutated version of H5N1 in the lung tissue of an asymptomatic cow that had been sent to slaughter. While the cow was blocked from entering the food supply by FSIS, officials suggested the \"isolated\" incident raised questions about how the virus was spreading.\n\nSigns of bird flu have also made its way into the retail dairy supply, with as many as one in five samples of milk coming back positive in a nationwide Food and Drug Administration survey.\n\nThe FDA has chalked those up to harmless fragments of the virus left over after pasteurization, pointing to experiments showing that there was no live infectious virus in the samples of products like milk and sour cream that had initially tested positive.\n\nBut the discovery has worried health authorities and experts that cows could be flying under the radar without symptoms, given farms are supposed to be throwing away milk from sick cows.\n\nOne herd that tested positive in North Carolina remains asymptomatic and is still actively producing milk, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services told CBS News.\n\nIt remains unclear how H5N1 has ended up in the milk supply. Don Prater, the FDA's top food safety official, said Wednesday that milk processors \"can receive milk from hundreds of different farms, which may cross state lines,\" complicating efforts to trace back the virus.\n\n\"This would take extensive testing to trace it that far,\" Bailee Woolstenhulme, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, told CBS News.\n\nWoolstenhulme said health authorities are only able to easily trace back milk to so-called \"bulk tanks\" that bottlers get.\n\n\"These bulk tanks include milk from multiple dairies, so we would have to test cows from all of the dairies whose milk was in the bulk tank,\" Woolstenhulme said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Although the CDC considers the virus to be \"a low risk to the general public,\" there's been a snag in probing a human case of H5N1.\n\nCDC epidemiologists have reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that they hit a stumbling block when they couldn't get onto a Texas dairy farm where a person caught the virus in March, hindering their investigation into potential exposure among workers.\n\nLara Anton, representing the Texas Department of State Health Services, explained the difficulty arose because the infected dairy worker \"did not disclose the name of their workplace\" when tested at a Texas field office.\n\n'Zombie virus' in permafrost could spark next global pandemic with expert providing warning Taking up exercise in middle age 'turns back the clock' on years of inactivity\n\nThis hiccup meant that epidemiologists missed the chance to take additional samples from the dairy farm worker or their contacts, potentially overlooking further cases, reports the Express US.\n\nThe report highlighted that the worker didn't use protective eye gear or a mask, which might have blocked the infection. The CDC suspects the virus spread through contaminated hands or droplets from ill cattle.\n\nBird flu had been circulating in cows for an estimated four months before it was confirmed by labs in late March, according to a new report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday.\n\nSince then, at least 36 dairy cow herds have been infected across nine US states, including Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nWhile traces of the virus have been found in samples of milk from grocery stores, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said pasteurized milk remains safe to drink.\n\nOfficials have warned people not to drink raw milk, which has been linked to deaths of other animals like cats. The human worker who was infected in Texas has since recovered from their bird flu infection, after only developing conjunctivitis, or pink eye, without fever or other symptoms.\n\nCDC scientists said in the new report: \"While acute conjunctivitis is a clinically mild illness, HPAI A (H5N1) viruses, including those belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in infected humans worldwide.\" Anton said last week that there were likely other farm workers with symptoms for bird flu who did not want to be tested.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News, she expressed: \"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure that there were people sick with other respiratory viruses working on dairy farms.\"\n\nDespite this, the CDC has eased any concerns about unidentified H5N1 cases.\n\nProviding some reassurance, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stated on Wednesday: \"We continue to monitor flu surveillance data, especially in areas where H5N1 viruses have been detected in dairy cattle or other animals, for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu, or conjunctivitis. CDC flu surveillance systems at this time show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people.\"\n\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here.", "source":

Barb Petersen, an Amarillo field veterinarian, wondered whether there was a connection between the dead cats and the sick cows, even though H5N1 had never been definitively diagnosed in cattle before.\n\nDr. Petersen sent samples of the Texas cows' raw milk to a lab at the Iowa State College of Veterinary Medicine, where Drew Magstadt, a veterinary diagnostician, tested them expecting to rule out avian flu.\n\n\"I honestly thought that it was going to come back negative, and we were going to say that the cats got sick from eating infected birds,\" he said. \"And then we were going to move on to something else.\"\n\nInstead, he found himself \"incredibly surprised,\" to learn the Texas cows' milk was teeming with H5N1.\n\nThose positive tests, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on March 25, thrust bird flu back into the consciousness of a pandemic-weary public, setting off a race to determine how the virus is infecting cattle and what threat it might eventually pose to humans.\n\nPublic health leaders on both sides of the border say the risk of bird flu to humans is very low unless they have sustained direct contact with farmed or wild birds. The sole confirmed human case linked to the cattle outbreaks in the U.S. was in a Texas farmworker whose only symptom was pinkeye.\n\n\"Right now, the risk is probably close to zero,\" said Brian Ward, a professor of infectious diseases at McGill University.\n\nBut all that could change if the virus mutates significantly while circulating in livestock. \"The closer the potential vector is to humans, the more we need to pay attention to it,\" Dr. Ward said. \"And cows are obviously closer to humans than birds.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced that it would begin actively searching for undetected H5N1 in cows. The agency said it would test retail milk for harmless traces of the virus and offer voluntary testing of cows without obvious symptoms of bird flu.\n\nEarlier in the week, the agency mandated negative flu tests for American cows transported across the border.\n\nNo cases have been confirmed in Canadian cattle, but some experts suspect that's because officials have been waiting for farmers to report cows with symptoms, rather than pro-actively seeking the virus, as the agency is now promising to do.\n\n\"I've been disappointed,\" said Lawrence Goodridge, a professor with the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety at the University of Guelph. \"The standard talking point is that it's not here in Canada. So how do we know that?\"\n\nDr. Goodridge, who spoke to The Globe and Mail before the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Friday announcement, was part of a growing scientific chorus calling on the federal government to launch a comprehensive surveillance program, including testing wastewater for H5N1, something his own lab recently started doing.\n\nHe and others have good reason to suspect the virus could be flying under the radar on Canadian dairy farms. Bird flu probably circulated in American cattle for four months before Dr. Magstadt and his colleagues ran their tests, according to a USDA analysis of viral genomic sequences published Thursday that concluded the virus likely jumped from a wild bird to a cow in Texas last December.\n\nThe USDA also found fragments of H5N1 in one in five retail milk samples last month. Further tests confirmed the milk was safe to drink because it was pasteurized, but the viral traces suggested bird flu spread widely in cows before it was picked up. Tests of Canadian milk could find - or rule out - the same phenomenon here.\n\nThe situation on U.S. dairy farms has scientists particularly worried because the version of bird flu found in cows has already decimated wildlife around the world.\n\nA member of the influenza A H5N1 family known as 2.3.4.4b has wiped out poultry flocks, annihilated wild birds and spilled into an ever-expanding list of mammals that includes foxes, skunks, bears, cats and dogs. It caused a mass mortality event in South American sea lions, killing at least 24,000 in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil last year.\n\nIn Canada, more than 11 million farmed birds have died or been culled since H5N1 2.3.4.4b was first detected here in late 2021.\n\nFortunately, no cows in the U.S. are known to have died of the virus, which seems to cause mild illness in bovines. It's still unclear if or how the virus is transmitting among cows, although milking paraphernalia is a prime suspect because of the high viral load in the cows' milk and mammary tissues, USDA officials have said.\n\nThe Texas dairy worker with pinkeye may be the first detected example of avian flu transmitting from a mammal to a human, according to a new report published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The worker was not in contact with sick birds, unlike people who've caught avian flu in the past.\n\nDr. Ward said that humans have receptors for H5N1 flu deep in their lungs, not in their noses or upper airways, which explains why the viruses rarely infect people. When they do, the outcome can be frightening. Of nearly 900 confirmed human cases of bird flu identified worldwide since 2003, 52 per cent were fatal.\n\nThe true case fatality rate is almost certainly lower because mild cases were missed by authorities, skewing the ratio, and because the deaths happened in low-income countries where poor farmers have scant access to health care.\n\nStill, Dr. Ward said it would be cavalier to assume first-rate medical care would substantially reduce mortality if bird flu adapted to transmit between humans. \"These are bad viruses when they get into your lower respiratory tract,\" he said, \"whether you're a poor person living in Bangladesh or a rich person living in Westmount.\"\n\nIf avian influenza evolved to transmit easily between humans, the race would be on to produce and distribute a vaccine.\n\nHealth Canada has authorized three pandemic flu vaccines as a precautionary measure, two of which were developed using an older H5N1 strain. Like seasonal flu shots, the pandemic jabs are produced in eggs and take three to six months to make.\n\nCanada generally doesn't stockpile them because they only have a shelf life of two years, said Andr\u00e9 Gagnon, a spokesman for the Public Health Agency of Canada. Instead, under deals with several domestic and international pharmaceutical companies, the manufacturing process would kickstart as soon as the World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic or advised vaccine makers to switch from producing seasonal to pandemic shots.\n\nFor now, scientists like Fiona Brinkman, a professor of genomics and bioinformatics at Simon Fraser University, are keeping a close eye on viral genomic sequences from cows and other creatures as they are uploaded to public databases.\n\nThe sequences form an evolutionary trail that can be followed in reverse to see how the avian flu virus has mutated over time. One red flag for Dr. Brinkman is that a mammalian-adaptive mutation was seen in the cattle cases. \"It looks like what's happened is it jumped over once, from birds into cows, and now it's sort of jumping back into birds,\" she said.\n\nThat's a concern because wild birds could carry a version of the virus that more readily infects mammals north as they migrate, she added.\n\nThe prospect of H5N1 2.3.4.4b jumping to pigs is another worry, said Samira Mubareka, a clinician-scientist and virologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. Swine are notorious mixing vessels for influenza viruses because they have mammalian and avian receptors for flu viruses. The version of H1N1 that caused a mild pandemic in 2009 spilled over from pigs.\n\nDr. Mubareka said now is the moment for everyone committed to human health to pay extra attention to animal health, including by supporting veterinary scientists like those who solved the mystery of the sick barn cats and cows in Texas.\n\n\"We know the next pandemic pathogen is highly, highly likely to circulate in animals before it spills over into humans,\" she said. \"By the time it's impacting human health, we've lost a major opportunity to protect human health.\"", "source": {"uri":

However, the current strain of avian influenza, H5N1, has crossed species barriers, infected dairy cows and even transmitted from cows to humans. This is the first documented case of cow-to-human transmission, and the most recent human case of H5N1 infection occurred in April 2022 in Colorado, where the individual contracted the virus from poultry.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has taken measures to address the situation, including collecting ground beef samples from retail stores in states affected by the bird flu outbreaks. The samples will be tested to determine the presence of viral particles. Previous studies have found viral particles in cow's milk samples, with as many as 1 in 5 samples testing positive.\n\nAs part of containment efforts, the USDA has mandated that dairy cows test negative for bird flu before being transported across state lines. This decision follows criticism from infectious disease experts who argued that insufficient testing has hindered an accurate assessment of the outbreak's scale.\n\nA study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases revealed that cats died after consuming raw colostrum from infected cows, indicating the potential for cross-species transmission of the H5N1 virus within mammal populations.\n\nPublic health experts are concerned that as the virus continues to jump between animals and potentially humans, it increases the likelihood of mutation, human-to-human transmission, and establishment within the human population. Certain strains of H5N1 have demonstrated a 50% mortality rate in humans, although the confirmed case resulting from infected cows was mild. Epidemiologists and infectious disease experts have criticized the government's response and have called for swift action to contain the spread among animal populations.\n\nThe USDA has assured the public that the meat supply is safe and pasteurized milk remains safe for consumption. However, Colombia has imposed restrictions on the transportation of beef from U.S. states where dairy herds have tested positive for bird flu.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Bird Flu", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "baila_eve_zisman@uinterview.com", "name": "Baila Eve Zisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-species_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-species transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colostrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Department-for-Environment-Food-and-Rural-Affairs-workers-clear-up-dead-turkey-carcasses-at-Redgrave-Park-Farm-where-around-2600-birds-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 190}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The only indication that he had been infected was a striking case of pinkeye.\n\nDetails of the man's case -- the only documented instance of bird flu spreading from a cow to a human -- were published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, from health officials in Texas and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBird flu was first detected in several herds of dairy cows in late March. Around that same time, the man's right eye started to bother him and became red. He ended up with broken blood vessels in both eyes. Doctors said he had conjunctivitis, or pinkeye. The man had been in direct contact with both healthy and sick cows.\n\nSwabs of the man's eye and nose revealed he had the same strain of bird flu, H5N1, that was circulating in dairy cows.\n\nThe man was given the antiviral Tamiflu and was told to isolate as he recovered. No one he lives with became sick, though they, too, were given the antiviral to reduce that risk, the authors wrote.\n\nHe never developed respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the virus may not spread easily from person to person through coughs or sneezes.\n\nIndeed, genetic tests done on samples taken from the man's eyes and nose confirmed that there were no mutations that would allow the virus to spread this way.\n\nBut the threat that mutations like that could arise is real, especially as the virus continues to spread among dairy cows. As of Friday, 36 herds in nine states -- Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas -- had been affected by the outbreak.\n\nH5N1 viruses \"pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in infected humans worldwide,\" the report's authors wrote. \"Therefore, rapid implementation of preventive measures is recommended to reduce human exposures to any infected animals and environments contaminated by them.\"\n\nData from other countries show the virus can have a fatality rate of more than 50% in humans, according to the CDC.\n\nMore than 100 people have been told to monitor themselves for symptoms, and about 25 people have been tested for bird flu, the CDC said during a media briefing on Wednesday. So far no one else has tested positive. But veterinary experts suspect that cases are going undetected among dairy farmers worried that they'll lose their cattle if they report a positive test.\n\n\"Farmers are very, very concerned about what happens if they're positive,\" said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. \"When I talk to dairy farmers in Wisconsin, a lot of them just want it to go away like, 'well, what do we do about it? I'm really only concerned about whether or not I can make my mortgage next week.'\"\n\nNo bird flu has been found in cows in Wisconsin, but Poulsen said the outbreak has the potential to lower consumer confidence about the safety of dairy products.\n\n\"If the dairy industry takes a hit anywhere in the country, then it takes a hit on us, too,\" he said. The Department of Agriculture said earlier this week that tests on hundreds of pasteurized products like milk, cottage cheese and sour cream, showed no signs of live virus and are safe to consume.\n\nWhile the authors of the new report could not rule out the possibility that the Texas dairy worker was infected through respiratory droplets, they wrote that the man likely got infected by rubbing his eyes with a contaminated hand. He was wearing gloves but no goggles or other form of eye protection.\n\nThe CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized.\n\nThe authors of the report said they were not able to follow up with the worker to do additional testing to study his antibodies or see how long the virus stayed in his system.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki",

Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said researchers are not seeing changes in the virus that would indicate it might spread more easily between people. The dairy worker reported with bird flu on April 1 is the second human case of the virus reported in the U.S. The worker had conjunctivitis, a mild eye infection, and recovered.\n\nA: Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency is looking for unusual trends in flu-like illnesses around the country and conjunctivitis -- especially in areas where H5N1 virus has been found in dairy cattle or other animals. CDC's flu surveillance systems are not showing any signs of unusual flu activity, which might indicate avian influenza.\n\nThe CDC is also supporting the monitoring of exposed workers, Daskalakis said. People who have been exposed to infected cows, poultry or other animals are monitored for 10 days and if they show symptoms of illness, they are then tested. So far over 100 farm workers have been monitored.\n\nHe said the CDC is also providing guidance for farm worker protection, which includes a graphic for recommending personal protective equipment for those who work with farm animals and that is available in English and Spanish.\n\nHe said the agency is also conducting ongoing lab work, which includes genetic sequencing. Because viruses are constantly changing, he said the CDC is continually analyzing the virus to identify any genetic changes that suggest these viruses might spread more easily to and between people or might change in a way that makes antivirals and vaccines less effective.\n\nA: Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA, said studies indicate the recent infections of dairy cattle in the U.S. was the result of one \"spillover event\" from wild birds, and that they are not finding more than that single event.\n\nThat first spillover from birds to cows occurred in Texas and took place among a number of herds, she said. Once infected cows from those herds were moved to other states, the infection spread. As of Wednesday, 36 U.S. herds in nine states had confirmed infections, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\nSifford said the movement of cattle spreads the virus, but she also noted it can also spread through farming equipment. She said farmers with affected herds have reported about 10% of their herds displayed symptoms.\n\nShe said these cattle with symptoms \"generally\" returned to near their previous milk production levels after recovering from the virus, which is taking about two weeks. She said most cows are recovering with \"little or no associated mortality.\"\n\nLast week, the FDA announced it had done testing on 96 commercially available milk products and found genetic traces in one of five samples, but that early data showed no live virus. Donald A. Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA, said the agency had done testing of an additional 201 products, which include cottage cheese and sour cream in addition to milk, and early data found none of the samples had \"viable virus.\"\n\nSeveral samples of powdered infant formula were also tested and the results from these tests were also negative.\n\nFederal agencies expressed more concern about the possible dangers of drinking raw milk, and they once again urged people to not drink raw milk or eat raw cheese.\n\nThere are four commercially available FDA-approved prescription antiviral treatment drugs recommended for influenza that are effective against H5N1, according to the CDC.\n\nWhen reporters pressed CDC's Daskalakis about farm workers being given the antiviral medication Tamiflu \"prophylactically,\" to protect them from illness, he said for the workers being offered this, it's a clinical decision made on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The only indication that he had been infected was a striking case of pink eye.\n\nDetails of the man's case -- the only documented instance of bird flu spreading from a cow to a human -- were published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, from health officials in Texas and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBird flu was first detected in several herds of dairy cows in late March. Around that same time, the man's right eye started to bother him and became red. He ended up with broken blood vessels in both eyes. Doctors said he had conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The man had been in direct contact with both healthy and sick cows.\n\nSwabs of the man's eye and nose revealed he had the same strain of bird flu, H5N1, that was circulating in dairy cows.\n\nThe man was given the antiviral Tamiflu and was told to isolate as he recovered. No one he lives with became sick, though they, too, were given the antiviral to reduce that risk, the authors wrote.\n\nHe never developed respiratory symptoms, which suggests that the virus may not spread easily from person to person through coughs or sneezes.\n\nIndeed, genetic tests done on samples taken from the man's eyes and nose confirmed that there were no mutations that would allow the virus to spread this way.\n\nBut the threat that mutations like that could arise is real, especially as the virus continues to spread among dairy cows. As of Friday, 36 herds in nine states -- Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas -- had been affected by the outbreak.\n\nH5N1 viruses \"pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in infected humans worldwide,\" the report's authors wrote. \"Therefore, rapid implementation of preventive measures is recommended to reduce human exposures to any infected animals and environments contaminated by them.\"\n\nData from other countries show the virus can have a fatality rate of more than 50% in humans, according to the CDC.\n\nMore than 100 people have been told to monitor themselves for symptoms, and about 25 people have been tested for bird flu, the CDC said during a media briefing on Wednesday. So far no one else has tested positive. But veterinary experts suspect that cases are going undetected among dairy farmers worried that they'll lose their cattle if they report a positive test.\n\n\"Farmers are very, very concerned about what happens if they're positive,\" said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. \"When I talk to dairy farmers in Wisconsin, a lot of them just want it to go away like, 'well, what do we do about it? I'm really only concerned about whether or not I can make my mortgage next week.'\"\n\nNo bird flu has been found in cows in Wisconsin, but Poulsen said the outbreak has the potential to lower consumer confidence about the safety of dairy products.\n\n\"If the dairy industry takes a hit anywhere in the country, then it takes a hit on us, too,\" he said. The Department of Agriculture said earlier this week that tests on hundreds of pasteurized products like milk, cottage cheese and sour cream, showed no signs of live virus and are safe to consume.\n\nWhile the authors of the new report could not rule out the possibility that the Texas dairy worker was infected through respiratory droplets, they wrote that the man likely got infected by rubbing his eyes with a contaminated hand. He was wearing gloves but no goggles or other form of eye protection.\n\nThe CDC recommends that anyone in contact with dairy cattle wear protective equipment, including safety glasses, waterproof aprons and boots that can be sanitized.\n\nThe authors of the report said they were not able to follow up with the worker to do additional testing to study his antibodies or see how long the virus stayed in his system.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki",

Despite the lack of critical background information on those samples, that group came to nearly the same conclusion as the USDA: that the virus had crossed over from wild birds to cows between mid-November and mid-January, which means it was circulating for months before anyone knew.\n\nThe USDA officially confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus on March 25 in dairy cows in Texas. Since then, at least three dozen infected herds have been reported across nine states. At least one farmworker who was in contact with infected cows in Texas also tested positive for H5N1, the second human case of this type of flu ever reported in the US. The worker was given antiviral medication and has recovered.\n\nTests of milk from retail stores have shown inert remants of the virus in about 1 in 5 samples, the US Food and Drug Administration reported last week, suggesting that the infection had become widespread. Further testing by the FDA has confirmed that the virus in the samples of pasteurized dairy products was not active and couldn't make anyone sick, but experts have strongly advised against the consumption of raw milk.\n\n\"We could have done a much better job\" catching H5N1 in dairy cows, said Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona who was part of the group of biologists that conducted the independent analysis. Worobey studies how pandemics start.\n\nWorobey said that as soon as the cows were noticeably sick with something mysterious, instead of testing for specific viruses and bacteria, ideally, a lab would have used a technique called metagenomic sequencing, which reads all the genetic material in a sample and uses computers help pick out relevant information.\n\n\"If that had been done, that would have revealed H5N1 in January and then even beyond that,\" he said.\n\nIf we're serious about preventing outbreaks in animals that could lead to human pandemics, Worobey said, regulators need to change their approach.\n\n\"We have to get out of the mindset of waiting for that tip of the iceberg of sick animals or sick humans to be noticed.\" Instead, he said, animals need to be routinely tested with \"modern techniques\" for identifiying emerging pathogens.\n\nThe new study gives the USDA's account of how bird flu seemed to spread so quickly to herds across the US. Samples collected between March 7 and April 8 found very similar H5N1 viruses in 26 herds in eight states and six poultry flocks in three states, suggesting that the virus had crossed over in a single spillover event between wild birds and cows.\n\nThe study says \"production veterinarians\" first noticed cows who weren't eating well with changes to their milk production and quality in late January.\n\nH5N1 has been devastating wild and domestic bird populations in the US since 2022, and it has infected a growing number of mammals.\n\nIn addition to the movement between cattle and wild birds, the study found evidence that infected cattle had passed the virus to domestic poultry flocks \"through multiple transmission routes.\" The researchers also found that the virus involved in the current outbreak had infected a wild animal - a raccoon - and cats that lived near the cows on dairy farms.\n\nInterestingly, the virus sequenced from the infected farmworker had key differences from the cow genomes. The USDA scientists concluded that the differences might mean they were missing samples from the animals the farmworker had come into contact with or could have been due to the evolution of the virus from host to host.\n\nWorobey says the study means H5N1 is \"now seemingly well-entrenched in the dairy cattle population in the country\" and might be something we have to deal with for years to come.\n\nAlthough it's by no means clear that this virus will change in the right combination of ways to launch a human pandemic, he said, allowing a virus to get a foothold in a population of domesticated animals puts everyone at risk.\n\n\"It does add one more species - a very important species - that didn't have influenza A virus circulating in it before to the list of species where these viruses can have the opportunity to find that right combination that allows them to wreak havoc in the human population, not just animals,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It's Not a Dire Threat for Most of Us  --  Yet. - KFF Health News", "body": "Headlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nQ: Who gets the bird flu?\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases -- except for the sea lion infections -- appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested. \"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nQ: Is this the start of the next pandemic?\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\nAlthough at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can't lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won't happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze, and breathe. As we learned in the depths of covid-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop.\n\nThat hasn't happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus's survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds'.\n\nThe evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu, and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned.\n\nQ: Will a pandemic start if a person drinks virus-contaminated milk?\n\nNot yet. Cow's milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses, and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless.\n\nUnpasteurized \"raw\" milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus -- in its current form -- does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does.\n\nQ: What should be done?\n\nA lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported.\n\nBut just as restricting covid tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases.\n\nSuch limited testing won't reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle -- information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them.\n\nTo boost testing, Fred Gingrich, executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss.\n\n\"These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,\" Gingrich said. \"Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can't be sold.\"\n\nThe government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven't budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples, and file paperwork. \"Tests are the least expensive part,\" he said.\n\nIf testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA's slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said.\n\nThe government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis.\n\nWaterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals, or temporarily ushering them into barns. \"We should be spending on prevention,\" Pitesky said.\n\nQ: OK it's not a pandemic, but what could happen to people who get this year's H5N1 bird flu?\n\nNo one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it's positive, they send a person's sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. \"Thus far we have received 23,\" Shah said. \"All but one of those was negative.\"\n\nState health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They're checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages, or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they'll be tested.\n\nAnother way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work.\n\n\"The fact that we're four months in and haven't done this isn't a good sign,\" Worobey said. \"I'm not super worried about a pandemic at the moment, but we should start acting like we don't want it to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "kffhealthnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kaiser Health News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fragments of bird flu have also been discovered in retail milk samples.\n\nHowever, the CDC is struggling to gain access to dairy farms to monitor the spread. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies,\" the agency told the Financial Times.\n\nSeveral strains of bird flu have caused concern in recent years, triggering culls of poultry stocks and infecting mammals including dogs and sea lions. Avian influenza has yet to spread widely in humans but it is often fatal when contracted, causing more than 1,000 reported deaths since 2003.\n\nIt is likely the H5N1 strain of the virus had been circulating in US cattle for more than four months before it was first confirmed in late March, according to a scientific paper published on Thursday.\n\nBut the CDC still classifies the public health risk from the bird flu cattle outbreak as low. Only one animal-to-human crossover case has been reported during this outbreak -- in a Texas dairy worker whose only observable symptom was conjunctivitis, a mild eye infection.\n\nGovernments are nonetheless planning for the possible spread to people.\n\nThe US said the first batches of a pair of two-dose bird flu vaccines could be available within weeks if widescale human-to-human transmission were to occur, and tens of millions of doses could be available within months. Studies suggested these jabs offered \"good cross-protection\" against avian flu circulating in cattle, Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said this week.\n\nA vaccine against avian influenza had already been approved in Europe and others could be updated as needed, the EU's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. The World Health Organization regularly updates a list of known candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemic risks.\n\nTests carried out by the US Department of Agriculture said there was no trace of bird flu virus particles in ground beef samples that were tested for the pathogen.\n\nCattle futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange opened sharply higher on Friday, after dropping more than 6 per cent on Wednesday, when the department banned infected cattle from crossing state borders.\n\nEarly PCR test results from 297 retail milk samples across 38 states detected the H5N1 virus in one in every five samples. But pasteurisation kills the pathogen and therefore outbreak is unlikely to impede US dairy supplies, according to the National Milk Producers Federation.\n\n\"Cows are getting a little sick, which means they have to come out of production for a few weeks, but then after that they come back online,\" said Alan Bjerga, NMPF executive vice-president of communications.\n\nExperts pointed to possible obstacles to tracking the virus, with potential friction between public health investigators and the agricultural sector.\n\n\"There's always a tension between the human health people and animal health people,\" said Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner. \"The human health people would swab anything; animal health worry more about economic implications.\"\n\nInvestigations needed to happen quickly because the danger could increase as the pathogen evolved, said Michael Osterholm, professor of environmental health sciences at Minnesota university. One route would be via a reassortment: an exchange of genetic material between viruses, particularly if the virus spreads in swine populations.\n\n\"One of the problems with influenza is that the risk can be very, very low for days and all it takes is a few mutations to occur -- and you suddenly have a pandemic virus,\" Osterholm said.\n\nThe virus appeared already to be the product of a reassortment between types of H5N1 pathogen previously observed in Europe and the Americas, said Prof James Wood, an infectious diseases expert at the UK's University of Cambridge.\n\n\"Because this effectively is a new virus, there is a lot of uncertainty around what its characteristics are.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [],

The dairy worker who became ill in March developed conjunctivitis, or pink eye, Dr. Ansorg said, not pneumonia, which can be far more lethal. A poultry worker who developed the symptom of fatigue in 2022 soon recovered. Both cases were suspected to be a result of direct contact by infected material, rather than the respiratory route COVID-19 is known to take.\n\nOffering the greatest assurance to humans is that the U.S. has an approved H5N1 vaccine, said Dr. Lynn Fitzgibbons, who teaches and specializes in infectious diseases at Cottage Hospital. \"As with any emerging disease, we are keeping track of whether this might develop into an epidemic that requires a vaccine response. The great news is that we are very well positioned to respond should that occur,\" Dr. Fitzgibbons said.\n\nThe current H5N1 chain of events started late in 2021 when wild birds in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia developed a \"highly pathogenic\" avian influenza virus, or one that had a strong ability to cause disease in birds. By 2022, U.S. chicken and turkey flocks became infected, including 41 commercial flocks and 25 backyard flocks in California. According to the CDC, cases varied from sea lions in Peru to a polar bear in the Arctic and fur seals in the Antarctic. In Europe, infection began to be reported in wild mammals and in domesticated animals like dogs, cats, mink, goats, and cows. In the U.S., detections in mammals have been reported in at least 20 states.\n\nAmong birds, mortality from H5N1 is from 90-100 percent. It's so dangerous to birds that at the Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network, strict protocols are in place to keep it out, including stopping visitors at the gate, covering shoes, and washing hands. To prevent spread, said the nonprofit's Rachel Mattovich, if you come across a dead or sick wild bird or animal, don't touch it. Call their helpline, she said, for advice on what to do -- (805) 681-1080 -- as the creature could carry an infection.\n\nCows are clearly more able than birds to withstand H5N1. The infected dairy cows were clearing the virus in a week or two, Ansorg said. The quicker recovery time gave the virus less opportunity to develop mutations, including any that might enable it to jump more easily to humans.\n\nMost recently, concern arose over old dairy cows sold for meat after a lung tissue sample taken by a USDA inspector at a slaughterhouse came up positive for H5N1. While cows can carry the virus and not appear sick, cows that are clearly sick may not be used for meat. By May 1, in states with dairy cattle positive for H5N1, 30 samples or ground beef from retail outlets were tested and all found to be negative for the virus.\n\nAs for the milk supply, federal and state authorities became involved after the movement of cows from Texas to Michigan, Idaho, and New Mexico led to infections among herds in those states. Nine states and 38 herds are known to be infected as of Wednesday, but so far, no infected cows have been observed in California. Testing is mandatory for any lactating cows moving between states, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture reporting 2,000 samples taken in the past several weeks.\n\nAbout 400 milk, sour cream, and cottage cheese samples from commercial and retail locations were tested in 38 states, with one in five samples coming up positive for virus fragments, the Food and Drug Administration reported. The fragments were unviable, having been killed by the pasteurization process. Infant and toddler formula, both liquid and powder, were also tested, coming up with no virus or fragments. The initial tests were PCR tests, which find any DNA fragments; more time-consuming tests involving incubating samples in eggs are ongoing.\n\nThe testing and monitoring continue, California state officials said, though they agree the avian flu virus was \"not a significant public health threat.\" Should tests detect the disease in California herds, biosecurity to keep H5N1 from being tracked to other dairy or poultry providers would be put into action, an CDFA spokesperson said, as well as working with state Food and Agriculture veterinarians on disease control and with Public Health to ensure employee health was protected and monitored.\n\nAsked if it might be wise to give up the caf\u00e9 latte, Ansorg said he'd been asked the same thing at a recent emergency preparedness meeting: \"We were able to reassure them that they could drink a cappuccino or latte without fear of getting sick.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Santa Barbara

same symptoms as those in a nearby farm with a confirmed outbreak of the virus, according to new details on the case released on Friday.\n\nThe details, reported online in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscore the risk to farm workers in the ongoing outbreak among US dairy cattle and the need to wear protective gear to avoid infection.\n\nThe outbreak - the first in cattle - is so far known to have infected 36 dairy herds in nine states.\n\nInfection by the bird virus is rare in humans, and the dairy worker's case, first reported in March, represents only the second known human infection in the United States.\n\nIt follows a worrisome spread of the virus in a variety of mammal species, raising concerns that widespread exposure of people could cause the virus to spread more easily among the population and spark a global pandemic.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the report said the farm worker developed a serious infection in his right eye known as conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but had no signs of respiratory infection or fever.\n\nThe worker had not reported any contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but did have close exposure with sick dairy cows, with symptoms such as decreased milk production, reduced appetite and lethargy.\n\nThe worker had been wearing gloves but no respiratory or eye protection.\n\nThe CDC is urging farmers, workers, and emergency responders to wear appropriate protective gear when in direct or close physical contact with sick birds, livestock, faeces, raw milk or contaminated surfaces.\n\nAn analysis of the outbreak released on Thursday by the US Department of Agriculture suggests the virus has been circulating in US dairy cows for about four months before being reported on March 25.\n\nPreliminary tests of milk, baby formula and other dairy products suggests they are safe to consume, according to the FDA.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news",

What the latest testing tells us.", "body": "Inactive bits of bird flu virus have found their way into some of the U.S. food and milk supply amid the latest outbreak of the disease in animals. It comes as the virus, also known as avian flu, continues to spread among a growing number of mammals, most pressingly, dairy cattle. While the reports may sound scary, experts say these fragments are not dangerous, and harmful versions of the virus are unlikely to wind up in anything people eat or drink.\n\nHere's what you need to know about bird flu and the safety tests being conducted on dairy, meat and more.\n\nTests conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detected the genetic material, or RNA, of avian flu in about 20% of samples of commercially sold milk collected from across the country. Separate testing of a smaller number of milk cartons off grocery shelves by researchers at Ohio State University (OSU) and St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital found bird flu RNA fragments in about 39% of the 150 samples they tested.\n\n\"It definitely suggests to me that it's more widespread than what we had given it credit for, but in some regard that's not entirely unexpected,\" Dr. Andrew Bowman, an associate professor of epidemiology and veterinary medicine at OSU, and co-author of the smaller milk study, tells Yahoo Life.\n\nBut the good news is that, along with the FDA's testing, tests conducted by Bowman and his co-author, Richard Webby, a professor of infectious disease at St. Jude's, have not found any samples with whole, or viable, avian flu virus. Small portions of the virus are not capable of causing an infection. Instead, Webby compares the testing of milk to on-screen detectives doing DNA testing at a crime scene: \"They're not necessarily looking for the virus itself, just the evidence that it's been there at some stage,\" Webby, who heads up the World Health Organization's (WHO) initiative to study flu in birds and animals, tells Yahoo Life.\n\nSamples of commercially sold milk found to contain virus fragments have been further tested to see if those bits of virus can grow in eggs or petri dishes, too, and so far, none of them have been able to do so. \"If there was whole virus in a sample, it would replicate and we would find it, but we have not been able to find any,\" Webby said. The FDA came to the same conclusion after running the same types of tests.\n\nThis is all evidence that pasteurization -- the process used to sterilize milk -- inactivates bird flu because it \"breaks open the viral package,\" Webby explains. Pasteurization is designed to kill all manner of viruses and bacteria and make milk safer. Unpasteurized, or raw, milk makes up less than 1% of the U.S. supply, and is banned in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The FDA advises against drinking it because it can lead to food poisoning.\n\nWith regular grocery store milk, there's very little cause for concern at this point, according to Webby and Bowman.\n\nThe FDA has also tested cottage cheese and sour cream for bird flu. Once again, the agency found noninfectious traces of the virus, but pasteurization had inactivated avian influenza in these products too.\n\nOfficials also tested baby formula and powdered milk derived from cows' milk. The results were even better there: There was not a trace of virus in any of these products. FDA scientists concluded that no further testing was needed to prove that the products are safe.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) declared the U.S. meat supply \"safe\" on May 1, according to Reuters. USDA officials tested 30 samples of ground beef collected in states where cattle herds have tested positive for bird flu. All of the samples tested negative for the virus.\n\nWhile infections have not been reported among herds of cattle bred for use as meat, dairy cattle -- among which bird flu has been spreading -- are sometimes used for ground beef. Webby says that flu is unlikely to replicate in the muscle, but it's unclear if it could in other parts of the animal that get processed into ground beef. Still, he says that the highest concentrations of bird flu have consistently been found in milk, and that safely handling and cooking beef -- by not letting cross contamination happen in the kitchen, and cooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 145\u00b0F -- should kill any viruses.\n\nBird flu has been found in egg-laying chickens, including those kept by Cal-Maine Foods, which is the largest manufacturer in the U.S. But the CDC says it's unlikely that anyone would catch bird flu from eating eggs.\n\nFor one, you shouldn't eat raw eggs, which can make you sick from other pathogens, like listeria. Like beef, cooking eggs to a proper temperature of 135\u00b0F to 165\u00b0F (depending on how you're preparing them) should kill any bacteria or viruses, including bird flu.\n\nWebby adds that bird flu is extremely fatal to chickens, so most that get infected will die, and farmers immediately cull any affected flocks, since only bird flu-free eggs and chickens can be sold in the U.S. and birds are regularly tested by regulators.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children's_Research_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petri dish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NE_5h1IVmr8kuMU.I8RUPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/8ac75100-08d1-11ef-adaf-8a3f3ba58d75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 3488, "textEnd": 3493}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They're concerened some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus.\n\n\"I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,\" says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. \"We just don't really know.\"\n\nThere have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThese people are in \"the footprints of where the bovine detections are,\" says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations.\n\n\"There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,\" he adds.\n\nThe lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit.\n\nBut the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,\" says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture.\n\nAlso, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, \"possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.\"\n\nThe federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring.\n\nHowever, there still remain \"serious gaps\" in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. \"There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.\"\n\nOnly complicating matters -- the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture.\n\n\"Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,\" says Bowman.\n\nThe health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC.\n\nFederal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock.\n\nBut even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak.\n\n\"I worry that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,\" says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing.\n\nFill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and \"not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.\"\n\nTo get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans.\n\nDr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,\" says Young,regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo.\n\nGray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons -- their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers \"to wave the flag\" that there are infections.\n\nThe farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus \"a huge priority,\" but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says.\n\nDr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis.\n\nDairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds -- unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners.\n\n\"So what is their incentive to report?\" he says, \"It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.\"\n\nGray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover on farms.\n\nThey'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu -something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.\n\nWhat concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm.\n\n\"We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,\" he says, \"The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater.\"", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"},

Further testing narrowed that diagnosis down to H5N1.\n\nThe man's condition didn't worsen, but he was given a standard antiviral medication, oseltamivir, twice daily for five days, and was told to isolate at home. People living in his home were also given the antiviral to protect them from H5N1.\n\n\"Over the subsequent days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms, and household contacts remained well,\" the team wrote.\n\nClose laboratory inspection of the strain implicated in the man's infection reveal a key viral mutation, called PB2 E627K. This mutation \"has been associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts and detected previously in humans and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThey added that the man's H5N1 strain showed no evidence of mutations that might make it any less responsive to treatment with standard antivirals recommended against influenza.\n\nAnd there was good news for scientists developing avian influenza vaccines, should they become necessary: Specific vaccine-sensitive components of the strain of H5N1 that infected the dairy worker are \"closely related\" to viruses already being studied by bird flu vaccine researchers.\n\n\"Because influenza A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, these candidate vaccine viruses are available to manufacturers and could be used to produce vaccine if needed,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThe latest data on the outbreak of bird flu among U.S. dairy cows has detected infection in 36 herds across nine states. Tests conducted by federal health officials have found evidence of inactive DNA \"fragments\" of H5N1 in about 1 in 20 samples of milk, but no live virus -- it is thought that pasteurization kills the virus. Tests of ground beef have also turned up negative for the virus.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about H5N1 avian flu at the CDC.\n\nSOURCE: New England Journal of Medicine, May 3, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nThe only known human case of H5N1 avian flu linked to the ongoing outbreak among U.S. dairy cows was mild and resolved using a standard antiviral.", "source": {"uri": "norfolkdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Norfolk Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasal cavity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vital signs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/b2/cb2e83c6-a333-579f-8fe1-fec9c3ef0496/6634ffe7e1c7e.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C54&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1254, "textEnd": 1259}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Nobody else became ill.\n\nThe team, which included researchers from the Centres for Disease Control, said: \"Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiological data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably virus-infected cows.\"\n\nSome mammals infected\n\nThe highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 has been spread worldwide by wild birds.\n\nAt first it was largely poultry that were infected, with millions culled to prevent further spread.\n\nBut there have been some mammals infected, including small numbers of foxes, seals and dolphins in the UK.\n\nThere have also been suspicions that the virus has spread between farmed mink and within sealion colonies.\n\nBut there was surprise when it cropped up in the US in dairy cows, who were suffering from a sharp reduction in milk production.\n\nVirus been spreading for months\n\nEvidence suggests the virus has been spreading undetected since the start of the year. Some cows are asymptomatic.\n\nMore from Sky News:\n\nFirst wild animal seen using plant as medicine\n\nFace of 75,000-year-old Neanderthal woman reconstructed\n\nThe scientists believe the man could have been infected either by an airborne virus in the milking parlour landing in his eyes, or by a virus on his hands or gloves being transferred to his eyes.\n\nAlthough the farm worker only had a mild infection, H5N1 can be severe - and even fatal - for humans.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, 888 people have been infected worldwide between 2003 and the end of March this year, with 463 deaths.\n\nBeef and dairy products safe\n\nUS authorities have detected viral fragments - but not active virus - in pasteurised milk. They say dairy products and beef are safe.\n\nIn the UK, a risk assessment by government scientists has concluded the threat of a similar outbreak in dairy herds is very small.\n\nThey say animals are kept in different conditions, and there is little chance of the cow flu being carried by wild birds across the Atlantic.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skynews-dairy-cows-farm_6542024.jpg?20240503174337", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

This is linked to the unprecedented bird flu outbreak among cattle.\n\nThe department explains that such results reaffirm the safety of the supply of meat.\n\nWhen authorities were asked whether the bird flu outbreak among cows could threaten those who consume it, health authorities noted the rigorous inspection process of meat that the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees. The department explains that the service inspects every animal prior to slaughter. Moreover, carcasses of cattle need to pass inspection post-slaughter and found to be fit for entry in the food supply for humans.\n\nIn total, there were 30 ground beef samples that the National Veterinary Services Laboratories tested. These samples were bought in retail stores across states where herds of dairy cows were found to test positive for bird flu.\n\nAccording to a USDA spokesperson, ground beef that they tested were from stores in eight out of nine states found to have positive bird flu presence. Colorado was only found to have the bird flu in a dairy cow after the samples were collected by the USDA.\n\nFurther results regarding bird flu in beef may be expected soon. Meat samples taken from dairy cow muscles that inspectors at slaughter facilities condemned are still undergoing bird flu testing. The department is also looking into how cooking patties of beef at varying temperatures could kill the virus off.\n\nDr. Jose Emilio Esteban, the undersecretary for food safety at the USDA, stresses sureness of the safety of the meat supply. They are just doing so in order to boost scientific knowledge and to ensure that more data points are there to support such a statement.\n\nALSO READ: Bird Flu Infects, Kills Cats That Drank Milk From H5N1-Stricken Cows, Raising Concerns as Virus Might Be Evolving\n\nSo far, dairy cows from across nine states have been found to test positive for H5N1 bird flu, which is typically lethal to birds and other animals. These states include Texas, South Dakota, Ohio, New Mexico, North Carolina, Kansas, Idaho, Michigan, and Colorado. While this strain is usually lethal for others, cattle have been largely spared from it. At times, the infection just disrupts their milk production for a couple of weeks.\n\nSuch studies also come after dairy cow testing requirements were ramped up by the USDA. The department now requires cows that move across states to undergo testing.\n\nBird flu signs also appear to have reached the dairy supply. There have been as many as one in five milk samples found to test positive for bird flu. This was done in a nationwide survey of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIt is still a mystery how the virus was able to reach the milk. Don Prater, the top food safety official of the FDA, explains that milk processors may receive the milk from hundreds of dairy farms, which could also cross the lines of the state. This makes it more difficult to trace the roots of the virus. Bailee Woolstenhulme, a spokesperson of the Department of Agriculture and Food at Utah, explains that this would require extensive testing efforts.", "source": {"uri": "sciencetimes.com", "dataType":

The case is believed to be tied to recent detections of bird flu among dairy cows in the U.S. The Department of Agriculture has confirmed cows on dairy farms in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico and Michigan had been sickened by the virus, marking the first time the disease has been found in dairy cattle.\n\nWhile emphasizing there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, \"The risk here of something going from one or two sporadic cases to becoming something of international concern, it's not insignificant,\" CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah, MD, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event May 1. \"We've all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on.

But the risk could be quite big.'\n\nShe added: 'It's probably why I'm not sleeping very much right now.'\n\nDr Dugan also warned that the CDC was struggling to track the virus and establish whether it had spread to people in other states.\n\nAfter a person tested positive for the virus in Texas, it would be normal practice for the blood of their close contacts to be tested for antibodies against the virus -- called serology testing -- which would indicate whether the virus had spread.\n\nBut she said that this could not be carried out because the farmers in close contact with the case had refused to get tested.\n\nA tick indicates foods that have tested positive for bird flu, while a cross indicates those that have been tested for bird flu but were not found to contain the virus\n\nIt would also be common practice for the CDC to test those on farms with infected cattle who showed symptoms of illness.\n\nBut she said that, again, in many cases, health officials had 'not been as successful' in getting them tested.\n\nThe low numbers of people checked for the disease -- 25 tested and 100 monitored so far -- appear to underscore these difficulties.\n\nDr Vivien Dugan, who directs the CDC's flu division\n\nFor comparison, among poultry workers who have been dealing with H5N1 for more than two years, the CDC has tracked more than 8,000 people for symptoms.\n\nShe also said that in some cases the agency was having trouble accessing states because they had to be invited in by local health departments, an invite that was not always forthcoming.\n\n'We had a team pretty much ready to go six weeks ago when this really started to show up on our radar,' she added.\n\n'But this is not the average poultry-worker response situation. These are dairy farmers.\n\n'Some states have been able to contact workers directly and actively monitor. Others, of course, have not been as successful.'\n\nScientists are concerned about bird flu becoming established in a new species because this suggests it has acquired mutations enabling it to infect and spread between new animals - and people.\n\nA total of 36 cattle herds across nine states have so far tested positive for bird flu, with fears raised that the virus may be spread through the air after testing detected the pathogen in the lungs of a cow.\n\nThe virus has also been found in their milk and in grocery store milks, cottage cheese and sour cream -- in what could be possible transmission routes to humans.\n\nBut officials say that these pose no risk because the virus in these is 'not alive'. The products are treated with pasteurization, where they are rapidly heated and cooled, in order to kill any microbes within them.\n\nTests on ground beef, infant formula and powdered milk have, however, found no trace of the virus.\n\nUS officials have been repeatedly criticized for failing to share data publicly, including on whether pasteurized milk is still safe to drink.\n\nSome scientists have said they will no longer consume milk until the FDA shares more data, although they marked the recent tests as 'reassuring'.\n\nREVEALED: The foods that HAVE tested positive for bird flu\n\nHealth officials have added two new foods to the list of items that have tested positive for bird flu.

Why it's not a dire threat for most of us  --  yet.", "body": "Cows stand in the milking parlor on a dairy farm in New Vienna, Iowa, in 2023.Charlie Neibergall / AP file\n\nHeadlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak in cattle unusual is that it's spreading rapidly from cow to cow, whereas the other cases -- except for the sea lion infections -- appear limited. Researchers know this because genetic sequences of the H5N1 viruses drawn from cattle this year were nearly identical to one another.\n\nThe cattle outbreak is also concerning because the country has been caught off guard. Researchers examining the virus's genomes suggest it originally spilled over from birds into cows late last year in Texas, and has since spread among many more cows than have been tested.\n\n\"Our analyses show this has been circulating in cows for four months or so, under our noses,\" said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nNot yet. But it's a thought worth considering because a bird flu pandemic would be a nightmare. More than half of people infected by older strains of H5N1 bird flu viruses from 2003 to 2016 died. Even if death rates turn out to be less severe for the H5N1 strain currently circulating in cattle, repercussions could involve loads of sick people and hospitals too overwhelmed to handle other medical emergencies.\n\nAlthough at least one person has been infected with H5N1 this year, the virus can't lead to a pandemic in its current state. To achieve that horrible status, a pathogen needs to sicken many people on multiple continents. And to do that, the H5N1 virus would need to infect a ton of people. That won't happen through occasional spillovers of the virus from farm animals into people. Rather, the virus must acquire mutations for it to spread from person to person, like the seasonal flu, as a respiratory infection transmitted largely through the air as people cough, sneeze, and breathe. As we learned in the depths of Covid-19, airborne viruses are hard to stop.\n\nThat hasn't happened yet. However, H5N1 viruses now have plenty of chances to evolve as they replicate within thousands of cows. Like all viruses, they mutate as they replicate, and mutations that improve the virus's survival are passed to the next generation. And because cows are mammals, the viruses could be getting better at thriving within cells that are closer to ours than birds'.\n\nThe evolution of a pandemic-ready bird flu virus could be aided by a sort of superpower possessed by many viruses. Namely, they sometimes swap their genes with other strains in a process called reassortment. In a study published in 2009, Worobey and other researchers traced the origin of the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic to events in which different viruses causing the swine flu, bird flu, and human flu mixed and matched their genes within pigs that they were simultaneously infecting. Pigs need not be involved this time around, Worobey warned.\n\nCow's milk, as well as powdered milk and infant formula, sold in stores is considered safe because the law requires all milk sold commercially to be pasteurized. That process of heating milk at high temperatures kills bacteria, viruses, and other teeny organisms. Tests have identified fragments of H5N1 viruses in milk from grocery stores but confirm that the virus bits are dead and, therefore, harmless.\n\nUnpasteurized \"raw\" milk, however, has been shown to contain living H5N1 viruses, which is why the FDA and other health authorities strongly advise people not to drink it. Doing so could cause a person to become seriously ill or worse. But even then, a pandemic is unlikely to be sparked because the virus -- in its current form -- does not spread efficiently from person to person, as the seasonal flu does.\n\nA lot! Because of a lack of surveillance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have allowed the H5N1 bird flu to spread under the radar in cattle. To get a handle on the situation, the USDA recently ordered all lactating dairy cattle to be tested before farmers move them to other states, and the outcomes of the tests to be reported.\n\nBut just as restricting Covid tests to international travelers in early 2020 allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected, testing only cows that move across state lines would miss plenty of cases.\n\nSuch limited testing won't reveal how the virus is spreading among cattle -- information desperately needed so farmers can stop it. A leading hypothesis is that viruses are being transferred from one cow to the next through the machines used to milk them.\n\nTo boost testing, Fred Gingrich, the executive director of a nonprofit organization for farm veterinarians, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said the government should offer funds to cattle farmers who report cases so that they have an incentive to test. Barring that, he said, reporting just adds reputational damage atop financial loss.\n\n\"These outbreaks have a significant economic impact,\" Gingrich said. \"Farmers lose about 20% of their milk production in an outbreak because animals quit eating, produce less milk, and some of that milk is abnormal and then can't be sold.\"\n\nThe government has made the H5N1 tests free for farmers, Gingrich added, but they haven't budgeted money for veterinarians who must sample the cows, transport samples, and file paperwork. \"Tests are the least expensive part,\" he said.\n\nIf testing on farms remains elusive, evolutionary virologists can still learn a lot by analyzing genomic sequences from H5N1 viruses sampled from cattle. The differences between sequences tell a story about where and when the current outbreak began, the path it travels, and whether the viruses are acquiring mutations that pose a threat to people. Yet this vital research has been hampered by the USDA's slow and incomplete posting of genetic data, Worobey said.\n\nThe government should also help poultry farmers prevent H5N1 outbreaks since those kill many birds and pose a constant threat of spillover, said Maurice Pitesky, an avian disease specialist at the University of California-Davis.\n\nWaterfowl like ducks and geese are the usual sources of outbreaks on poultry farms, and researchers can detect their proximity using remote sensing and other technologies. By zeroing in on zones of potential spillover, farmers can target their attention. That can mean routine surveillance to detect early signs of infections in poultry, using water cannons to shoo away migrating flocks, relocating farm animals, or temporarily ushering them into barns. \"We should be spending on prevention,\" Pitesky said.\n\nNo one really knows. Only one person in Texas has been diagnosed with the disease this year, in April. This person worked closely with dairy cows, and had a mild case with an eye infection. The CDC found out about them because of its surveillance process. Clinics are supposed to alert state health departments when they diagnose farmworkers with the flu, using tests that detect influenza viruses, broadly. State health departments then confirm the test, and if it's positive, they send a person's sample to a CDC laboratory, where it is checked for the H5N1 virus, specifically. \"Thus far we have received 23,\" Shah said, \"all but one of those was negative.\"\n\nState health department officials are also monitoring around 150 people, he said, who have spent time around cattle. They're checking in with these farmworkers via phone calls, text messages, or in-person visits to see if they develop symptoms. And if that happens, they'll be tested.\n\nAnother way to assess farmworkers would be to check their blood for antibodies against the H5N1 bird flu virus; a positive result would indicate they might have been unknowingly infected. But Shah said health officials are not yet doing this work.\n\n\"The fact that we're four months in and haven't done this isn't a good sign,\" Worobey said. \"I'm not super worried about a pandemic at the moment, but we should start acting like we don't want it to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now what?", "body": "This article contains firsthand information gathered by reporters. This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents.\n\nColorado is investigating a second possible outbreak of bird flu in a dairy herd, the state veterinarian said this week.\n\nThe potential new outbreak -- coming less than a week after Colorado identified its first outbreak -- is an indicator of how rapidly health officials are trying to catch up to bird flu's spread through dairy cattle.\n\nDr. Maggie Baldwin, who manages the Colorado Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Division, did not provide additional details on the dairy or where it is located. She said the state is awaiting test results from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to confirm whether bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, is involved.\n\n\"USDA's confirmatory testing is taking a little bit longer with the load that they're getting currently for testing,\" Baldwin said.\n\nNationwide, avian influenza has reached at least 36 dairy herds in nine states, and state and federal officials recently released new testing orders intended to more aggressively track its spread.\n\nBut does that make it something you have to worry about (assuming you're not in the dairy business or a cow)? We asked Baldwin and others for their thoughts on some common questions.\n\nH5N1 strains of avian influenza virus, such as the one currently circulating, primarily stick to birds, especially waterfowl. Those animals make ideal hosts for the virus because they generally don't get sick from it and they are also often migratory -- meaning they are basically in the virus transport business.\n\nWhat has made this particular strain of bird flu somewhat unique is its staying power -- the virus has been circulating in the United States for at least two years -- and its continued ability to find new species to infect.\n\nAt The Sun, we have tracked infections as they moved from wild bird populations to commercial poultry farms. Baldwin said Tuesday the state has seen outbreaks at 34 poultry operations in the last two years, resulting in the loss or slaughter of 6.3 million birds.\n\nInfections then started jumping over into mammals, affecting skunks, foxes, mountain lions, bears and others.\n\nIn many of these instances, including when nonwaterfowl birds are infected, the virus is extremely lethal. For instance, mass-mortality events of seals and sea lions in South America in recent months have been attributed to highly pathogenic avian influenza. That's where the \"highly pathogenic\" part of the name comes from.\n\nBut it's especially unusual to see bird flu in cattle, said Franklyn Garry, a professor at Colorado State University who specializes in livestock management.\n\n\"What's really notable is there are very darn few flu viruses that substantially affect cows,\" he said. \"So in the cow world, we don't really worry about flu because it just doesn't happen much.\"\n\nNo, which is good, obviously, but also makes it harder to track.\n\nFlu viruses, as anyone who has ever caught one knows, are generally associated with respiratory illness: coughing, runny nose, etc. But cattle infected by HPAI generally show few respiratory symptoms. Instead, the main symptoms are fever, reduced appetite, reduced milk production and abnormal milk production -- i.e., the milk is thick and discolored.\n\nThese symptoms resolve after what Baldwin called \"supportive care.\"\n\nIn sum, the virus in dairy cattle is \"low pathogenic,\" Garry said. Such mild symptoms mean that it is possible -- likely even -- that infections are being missed, making it harder to figure out how many cows are actually affected.\n\nThis is where the mystery really heats up.\n\nBird flu was first detected in a dairy herd in the United States in March, in a herd in Texas. Baldwin said that genetic sequencing suggests the virus was introduced into dairy cattle from wild birds.\n\nBut subsequent spread appears to have been cow-to-cow, which Garry said is also unusual. Baldwin said neither of Colorado's two herds -- the one with a confirmed outbreak and the one under investigation -- had known contact with an infected herd.\n\nGarry said there is much still to learn about how the virus has moved around the country. But one possibility is that it spreads when cows move among herds.\n\nThis is why a new federal rule -- adopted into state regulation Tuesday -- requires dairy operators to conduct testing of lactating dairy cattle when moving them between states.\n\nIn the modern dairy industry, it turns out cows move around A LOT.\n\n\"There is a tremendous amount of movement of dairy cattle across the United States and between states,\" Baldwin said.\n\nColorado has 106 dairies with about 200,000 cows. Baldwin said in the first quarter of this year, dairy farmers exported about 34,000 cattle from Colorado and imported about the same number. In other words, about 17% of Colorado's population of dairy cattle turned over in three months.\n\nThis is partly due to consolidation and specialization within the dairy industry. Garry grew up on a dairy farm in upstate New York that had between 50 and 60 cows, about average for the time, he said. But the average dairy size today in Colorado -- hardly a top-producing dairy state -- is 2,000 cows.\n\nOperators often have multiple dairy farms, sometimes in different states. They may also own, or contract with, specialty operations that raise young calves until they are ready to move back to milking herds. All of this leads to lots of movement of cattle.\n\nThere is so much movement, in fact, that it has led to what some public health experts criticize as a gaping loophole: When an operation is moving large numbers of cattle, the new federal rule requires them to test only a sample of 30 cows for bird flu.\n\nStill, Baldwin said the new rule will provide a good level of surveillance testing.\n\n\"I think we will be catching a really broad sample,\" she said.\n\nThe answer here is simple, though somewhat speculative: The flu virus appears to concentrate in the mammary glands of cows.\n\n\"On a given dairy with the virus, the nonlactating and young animals are asymptomatic and don't appear to have any problems,\" Garry said.\n\nSo that makes milk-producing cows the most likely culprit for harboring and spreading the virus. But Garry said that is far from confirmed -- just one of the unknowns about how the virus infects cows, how it moves within their bodies and gets shed back out, and how it makes its way into a new animal.\n\nYep, but this doesn't seem like much to worry about for most people.\n\nTesting raw milk is one of the methods currently being used to track the virus's spread, so virus definitely gets shed by infected cows into their milk. The commercial milk supply appears safe, though.\n\nThe reason is because milk sold in stores is pasteurized -- meaning it's heated up to kill harmful pathogens in the milk. This process kills the flu virus.\n\nFederal authorities and others have tested samples of milk from stores and found bird flu particles in about one-fifth of them. But follow-up tests confirmed that all of those virus particles were dead, dead, dead. They couldn't infect anyone, and they couldn't replicate.\n\nThis could be more of a concern. Raw milk is not pasteurized, so live virus could remain in the milk.\n\nIt's unknown whether that poses an infection risk to humans. But there is one study that documented deaths in cats who were fed raw milk on a dairy farm where cows were infected with bird flu.\n\nSubsequent testing on two of those cats revealed that they had been infected by bird flu. It's not certain that the cats got sick from drinking the milk, though the study's authors call it \"a likely route of exposure.\"\n\nThese concerns were enough to scuttle a bill at the state Capitol this year that would have legalized sales of raw milk. (Raw milk remains available in Colorado, though, to people who buy a share in a cow from a dairy farm.)\n\nThe answer appears to be no -- again with the caveat that knowledge is evolving.\n\nSimilar to what it did with milk, the federal government took samples of ground beef sold in stores to look for bird flu virus. It didn't find any. (And if there were, safe cooking practices would kill it.)\n\nGarry said there also haven't been any reports of outbreaks in feedlots or other commercial beef operations.\n\nThe signs are encouraging right now, but viruses have a way of surprising.\n\nThere have been two people in the United States who are known to have been infected by bird flu. One was a worker on a commercial poultry farm in Colorado. The other worked on a dairy farm in Texas.\n\nBoth had minor symptoms -- for the dairy worker, it was an eye infection -- and they recovered quickly. (There has also been at least one infection internationally, in a man named Gosling who kept ducks as pets in his home. He also recovered but was heartbroken when his flock was culled, according to the BBC.)\n\nH5N1 bird flus, historically, have been nasty when they get into humans. Hundreds of people have been infected with bird flu strains worldwide since 2003, with a fatality rate above 50%.\n\nThe current virus doesn't appear to be evolving much in ways that make it more likely to infect humans, according to a genetic analysis of the virus taken from the Texas patient.\n\nThe concern, though, is that the longer the virus circulates, the more opportunity it will have to mutate into a more dangerous form -- especially if it jumps into a more frequent incubator for future human infections, like pigs. This is why public health leaders are calling for greater testing in the U.S., including better testing of dairy workers to see how many (if any) may actually be getting infected and not know it.\n\nThis may be especially difficult in the dairy industry, a 24/7 business where workers, many of them immigrants, may be reluctant to seek medical attention if not feeling well. Dairy farmers nationwide have been reluctant to allow health officials onto their land for testing, one veterinarian said.\n\n\"This particular disease is looked at as a scarlet letter,\" said Dr. Kay Russo, a Colorado veterinarian who consulted with doctors in Texas about the outbreak there.\n\n\"We do not know what we do not measure,\" she told the Associated Press. \"Unfortunately, the horse left the barn and took off a lot faster than we were able to mobilize.\"\n\nBaldwin defended the response so far, saying officials have worked as quickly as possible to get a handle on the problem.\n\n\"We're building the plane as we're flying it,\" Baldwin said.\n\nAnd they have a lot more to learn.\n\n\"There are more unknown things than there are known things,\" Garry said. \"Because this is so new and because we haven't seen it before, we have to find out a whole bunch of stuff about this virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado

Further testing narrowed that diagnosis down to H5N1.\n\nThe man's condition didn't worsen, but he was given a standard antiviral medication, oseltamivir, twice daily for five days, and was told to isolate at home. People living in his home were also given the antiviral to protect them from H5N1.\n\n\"Over the subsequent days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms, and household contacts remained well,\" the team wrote.\n\nClose laboratory inspection of the strain implicated in the man's infection revealed a key viral mutation, called PB2 E627K. This mutation \"has been associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts and detected previously in humans and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThey added that the man's H5N1 strain showed no evidence of mutations that might make it any less responsive to treatment with standard antivirals recommended against influenza.\n\nAnd there was good news for scientists developing avian influenza vaccines, should they become necessary: Specific vaccine-sensitive components of the strain of H5N1 that infected the dairy worker are \"closely related\" to viruses already being studied by bird flu vaccine researchers.\n\n\"Because influenza A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, these candidate vaccine viruses are available to manufacturers and could be used to produce vaccine if needed,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThe latest data on the outbreak of bird flu among U.S. dairy cows has detected infection in 36 herds across nine states. Tests conducted by federal health officials have found evidence of inactive DNA \"fragments\" of H5N1 in about 1 in 20 samples of milk, but no live virus -- it is thought that pasteurization kills the virus. Tests of ground beef have also turned up negative for the virus.\n\nDisclaimer: Statistical data in medical articles provide general trends and do not pertain to individuals.

"Reuters is an international news organisation owned by Thomson Reuters\n\nThe Texas dairy farm worker infected with H5N1 bird flu was not wearing respiratory or eye protection and had been exposed to cattle that appeared to have the same symptoms as those in a nearby farm with a confirmed outbreak of the virus, according to new details on the case released on Friday.\n\nThe details, reported online in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscore the risk to farm workers in the ongoing outbreak among U.S. dairy cattle and the need to wear protective gear to avoid infection.\n\nThe outbreak - the first in cattle - is so far known to have infected 36 dairy herds in nine states.\n\nInfection by the bird virus is rare in humans, and the dairy worker's case, first reported in March, represents only the second known human infection in the United States.\n\nIt follows a worrisome spread of the virus in a variety of mammal species, raising concerns that widespread exposure of people could cause the virus to spread more easily among the population and spark a global pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the report said the farm worker developed a serious infection in his right eye known as conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but had no signs of respiratory infection or fever.\n\nThe worker had not reported any contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but did have close exposure with sick dairy cows, with symptoms such as decreased milk production, reduced appetite and lethargy.\n\nThe worker had been wearing gloves but no respiratory or eye protection.\n\nThe CDC is urging farmers, workers, and emergency responders to wear appropriate protective gear when in direct or close physical contact with sick birds, livestock, feces, raw milk or contaminated surfaces.\n\nAn analysis of the outbreak released on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests the virus has been circulating in U.S. dairy cows for about four months before being reported on March 25.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@arynews.tv", "name": "Reuters", "type":

DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told Global News.\n\n\"If the virus is here, that would change the biosecurity recommendations around how individuals who work with cattle protect themselves and what measures we might put in place to prevent the further spread of the virus within cattle.\"\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended cattle workers wear protective gear. The guidance comes just over a month after it was reported one worker in Texas contracted the virus after coming into contact with dairy cattle -- an instance a study released by The New England Journal of Medicine Friday says could be the first known mammal-to-human transmission of the virus. The man was reported to have no fever but red, swollen eyes.\n\nThe spread of the virus, known as H5N1, from birds to dairy cattle has been a major development, and traces of it have since been found in grocery store milk in the U.S., according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe agency stressed that the material is inactivated and that the findings \"do not represent actual virus that may be a risk to consumers.\" Officials added that they're continuing to study the issue.\n\nMiller said it was only in January that experts thought the risk of the virus jumping into cattle was very, very low. That all changed in March, when it was detected in cows, and has since spread to nine states.\n\nMiller said Canada needs to do systematic surveillance of cattle to make sure the situation here doesn't mimic the one in the U.S. Knowledge that the virus can jump into cattle has created a new urgency, he said.\n\nCanada has so far not detected the bird flu virus in dairy cattle or other livestock, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says it is monitoring the situation closely.\n\nMiller said pandemics are at the highest risk of happening when humans are close to animals infected with a virus known to jump between species -- and cattle is one animal humans happen to be around a lot, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization said in April that the potential for the virus to transfer to humans is an \"enormous concern.\"\n\nAccording to Miller, if the spread of the virus in the U.S. was due to one cow contracting the virus from a bird, or bird feces, rather than multiple cows, then it decreases the risk of it being widespread in Canada.\n\n\"The situation in the U.S. warrants a much more systematic and deliberate look at this,\" he said. \"If we find (the virus) in one place, it's likely that the cat is already out of the bag. And it's probably much more extensive than what we will appreciate.\"\n\nMiller said we shouldn't be sitting on our heels and waiting to find out about the virus when it is likely way ahead of us.\n\nSabina Vohra-Miller, founder of educational platform Unambiguous Science, told Global News that Canada currently isn't doing enough to be prepared for the virus and its potential spread. She said the CFIA isn't currently testing milk, and that is a \"huge mistake.\"\n\nShe said it is perfectly safe to drink pasteurized milk as the heat from the process kills any bacteria or virus, but to stay away from unpasteurized milk.\n\nWe need to be planning for the worst-case scenario, Vohra-Miller said, and ensure treatments are ready, such as making sure we can ramp up production of flu vaccines.\n\nThere are still unanswered questions, such as whether it is OK to eat raw steak, runny eggs, or cheese made from raw milk, Vohra-Miller said.

His \"vital signs\" were unremarkable other than that.\n\nHowever, \"the worker reported no contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, or other animals but was exposed directly and closely to dairy cows that seemed to be well and sick cows that showed the same signs of illness as cows at other dairy farms in the same area of northern Texas with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection,\" said researchers. When working with cows, the worker wore gloves, but did not wear eye or respiratory protection.\n\nIt was determined that he had the Bird Flu after swabs were taken from his eyes and nasal passages. Testing narrowed down the diagnosis to H5N1.\n\nA standard antiviral medication, oseltamivir, was given to the man twice daily for five days, and he was instructed to isolate at home. His neighbors were also given the antiviral to protect them against H5N1.\n\nOver the next few days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms, and household contacts remained healthy.\n\nLaboratory analysis of the viral strain implicated in the infection revealed the PB2 E627K mutation. In previous studies, the researchers noted that this mutation is associated with the adaptation of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to mammalian hosts.\n\nThe man's H5N1 strain did not exhibit any mutations that would impair the effectiveness of standard antivirals recommended for treating influenza.\n\nScientists developing avian influenza vaccines should they need them to have good news: The vaccine-sensitive components of the strain of H5N1 that infected the dairy worker are \"closely related\" to viruses already being studied by researchers developing bird flu vaccines.\n\nThe influenza A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, so manufacturers can make vaccines from them if necessary, according to the researchers.\n\nThere are 36 herds across nine states that have been infected with bird flu due to an outbreak of bird flu among U.S. dairy cows. The federal government has found evidence of inactive DNA \"fragments\" of H5N1 in about one in 20 samples of milk, but no live virus -- it is believed that pasteurization kills the virus. Virus tests on ground beef have also come back negative.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasal cavity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vital signs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HD1714742235279origin.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 659, "textEnd": 664}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Lester, who owns an exhibition farm in Newfoundland, Canada, learned that the culprit wasn't the novel coronavirus but the first known outbreak in North America of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, called H5N1. Hundreds of birds were infected and died. Scores more -- peacocks, geese, an emu -- had to be culled. They all \"had personalities,\" Lester said. \"It was a true tragedy.\" Since then, the virus has propagated down through the Americas, killing tens of millions of birds and, perhaps more concerning, infecting dozens of mammalian species: bottlenose dolphins in Florida; sea lions in Peru; elephant seals on the islands near Antarctica. Now, for the first time, the virus is circulating among cattle, and at least thirty-four herds across nine states in this country are known to be infected. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration announced that one in every five samples of milk in the United States carries fragments of the virus, suggesting an even wider spread. One expert called the situation \"totally unprecedented.\"\n\nInfluenza is a promiscuous pathogen. Its potential to unleash pandemics is due partly to the modular structure of its genome, which allows it to swap segments of its genetic material wholesale when different versions of the virus co-infect a cell. This occurred in the mid-nineties, when H5N1 was first isolated, from a goose in southern China, and went on to infect some twenty per cent of the poultry in Hong Kong markets, precipitating the slaughter of more than a million and a half chickens. In the intervening decades, the virus has periodically caused devastating outbreaks in poultry, but it remains poorly suited to the human respiratory tract, and that has limited its spread among people. Still, for those who do get infected -- usually farmworkers and others with exposure to animals -- the effects can be lethal. In some prior outbreaks, the virus inflicted a case-fatality rate of more than fifty per cent. Fortunately, only two people in the U.S. are known to have been infected, and both experienced mild symptoms. Since 2022, only about two dozen human cases have been recorded worldwide, and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk to public health remains low.\n\nThe prevalence of the virus in our milk supply may also be less alarming than it sounds. The P.C.R. test used to identify it can detect minuscule amounts of genetic debris, and a positive result does not imply that the virus is alive, much less contagious. Nearly all milk sold in the U.S. is pasteurized -- heated to destroy potential pathogens -- and that process may be especially effective for unstable viruses such as influenza. (Many states -- some, recently, as part of a broader backlash against public-health measures -- have legalized the sale of raw milk, which health officials generally do not advise consuming.) The tests needed to conclusively determine whether pasteurization kills H5N1 take time and involve injecting eggs with milk samples, but, according to the F.D.A., preliminary studies haven't found any traces of live virus.\n\nIt now seems likely that H5N1 was first transmitted from a bird to a cow late last year, and that the virus has been circulating unchecked among cattle for months. Many cows who shed the virus don't show symptoms, and how it spreads among them remains a mystery. Contamination of milking equipment is the most probable route, but respiratory transmission is also a possibility. So far, pigs haven't contracted the virus, which is good for them -- and us. Pigs have receptors for both avian and human versions of the flu, so they can serve as \"mixing vessels,\" facilitating genetic exchange in ways that could spawn a mutant capable of spreading among people and igniting another pandemic.\n\nIn the unlikely event of that emergency, we're far better positioned than we were for COVID. Influenza may be the world's most familiar viral pathogen -- its genome, virulence, and transmission patterns have been studied for decades. The U.S. has a large stockpile of Tamiflu, which should work against bird flu, as it does for other influenza strains, and which could be given to an infected person's contacts to mitigate spread. Health officials have also indicated that they could rapidly scale up testing and, if needed, shift the nation's annual flu-vaccine production to shots that are tailored for H5N1.\n\nBut the ability to respond is not the same as responding. The country's initial approach has had an unsettling resonance with the first months of COVID. Because there is no widespread program to screen farm animals for H5N1, we have little sense of how many have been tested or what proportion of tests have been positive. It took a month after bird flu was detected in cattle for the Department of Agriculture to require that lactating cows be tested before crossing state lines, and the agency has since clarified that only thirty animals in a group must be tested, irrespective of how large the group is. Last month, when the government released genetic sequences for scientists to study, it did not share information about where or when the samples were collected, making it difficult to track how the virus is spreading and evolving. Meanwhile, we haven't conducted antibody studies of farmworkers that could determine the extent to which they are getting infected; we'll know they're sick if they show up in emergency rooms.\n\nMany hospitals, of course, are still reeling from the pandemic, and leaders have expressed concern that they don't have the staffing, the resources, or the morale to contend with another crisis. The deeper problem, though, is the country's COVID hangover. America has emerged from the pandemic not just fatigued, but resentful and divided. If bird flu becomes human flu, one gets the sense that our principal fight won't be with the virus, but with one another.\n\nIn Albert Camus's novel \"The Plague,\" the vectors of disease are not birds but rats. The authorities are slow to act and, as the death toll mounts, people grow depressed, distrustful, violent. Even when the crisis eventually recedes, a doctor comes to feel that plague \"never dies or disappears for good.\" He notes, \"Perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.\" The rise of pandemic pathogens is an inextricable part of the modern world. The scale of their destruction doesn't have to be. \u2666", "source": {"uri": "newyorker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Yorker"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@newyorker.com", "name":

Mitt Romney 'alarmed' at bird flu spread, calls on federal agencies to do more to ensure safety", "body": "Sen. Mitt Romney is sounding the alarm about the spread of the bird flu virus and called on federal agencies to do more.\n\n\"I am alarmed by reports about the rapid spread of the bird flu virus (H5N1), and concerned that your agencies are not moving quickly enough to understand and contain the outbreak,\" the Utah Republican said in a letter to the heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was released Thursday.\n\n\"It is critical that you work swiftly to get ahead of this emerging situation and reassure the American public that they -- and our food supply -- remain safe,\" Romney wrote. \"Given your agencies' recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic and baby formula shortage, I am concerned that once again our federal government and its interagency process appears to be caught flat-footed.\"\n\nRomney is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n\nLate last week, federal food safety regulators said retail milk remains safe to drink even though 1 in 5 samples tested by the FDA found traces of highly pathogenic avian influenza's viral fragments, mostly in areas where bird flu was found in dairy cattle herds. Some 33 herds tested positive for the virus, in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas.\n\nThe CDC says the current public health risk is low but the agency \"is watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures.\" As of Tuesday, the CDC reported that \"H5N1 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows with one recent human case in a U.S. dairy worker,\" in Texas.\n\nThe only previous human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, the agency said.\n\nIn his letter, Romney said the CDC, along with the USDA and the FDA are responsible \"for protecting American consumers and livestocks from threats like bird flu.\" But, he added, \"Critical questions remain unanswered regarding the transmission and spread of the virus, requirements for testing livestock, and the safety of our milk and beef supply in the United States.\"\n\nThe senator, who is not seeking reelection this year, pointed out the first case of H5N1 was confirmed in dairy cattle on March 25, followed by the April 1 confirmation of the nation's second-ever human case of the virus strain. So far, no cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported but Romney said he's concerned about the fragments of the virus turning up in milk.\n\n\"It is essential that you move to fill the existing gaps in our public health knowledge by conducting sound science and quickly disseminating accurate information,\" Romney wrote, requesting a response to questions about the outbreak, including whether there are federal programs, like the CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System used to monitor COVID-19, that can track bird flu.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\n\nHe reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.\n\nEven though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has \"pandemic potential,\" and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.\n\n\"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they're not going to do is, they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\n\nStrater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but don't want to be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm.\n\nHealth officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu.\n\n\"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said.\n\nIn the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says.\n\nSwabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes - either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk - rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway.\n\nThe letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory.\n\nHealth officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm.\n\nThat kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all.\n\nThe CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study.\n\n\"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\" the agency said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.\"\n\nAt a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation \"very closely and taking this very seriously.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmworker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Farmworker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Farm Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/a71baa321b7d2e3df7ad34ca26176158", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture separately announced late Wednesday that their tests of pasteurized milk and ground beef failed to find any live H5N1 in samples at risk of being contaminated. The findings appear to confirm that pasteurization can effectively neuter the virus if it ends up in milk, but tainted raw milk might be still dangerous to consume.\n\nOutbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 in cows have occurred recently in dozens of dairy farms across nine states, with cases dating as far as back as late 2023. These strains are considered highly pathogenic due to the massive illness and deaths that they can cause among wild and domestic birds. So far, infected cows have typically avoided severe illness, but many have experienced symptoms such as reduced or discolored milk production and low appetite. There have also been several fatal cases of H5N1 in cats tied to these farm outbreaks, along with at least one nonfatal human case.\n\nIn late April, the FDA reported that it had detected genetic material from strains of H5N1 in samples of store-bought pasteurized milk, results that were later replicated by other researchers. Officials noted at the time that the method used to find H5N1 in milk -- highly sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing -- could not confirm the presence of live virus. And the FDA stated that it would follow up with \"gold standard\" testing, which could include trying to inoculate (grow) samples of the virus detected via qPCR inside chicken eggs.\n\nLast Friday, the FDA announced that an initial round of egg inoculation testing failed to find any live virus; yesterday, it reported that a larger round of testing turned up negative as well. All told, the agency has tested nearly 300 samples of dairy products, including sour cream and cottage cheese, collected from 38 states.\n\n\"[T]hese results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe,\" the FDA said in its latest update.\n\nElsewhere, a USDA report released on Wednesday assessing the meat supply should reassure the public. Officials collected 30 samples of ground beef from stores in states where dairy farm outbreaks had occurred and sent them off to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for PCR testing. All of these tests have returned negative. Additionally, PCR testing of retail powdered infant formula and powdered milk products marketed as toddler formula by the FDA has been negative as well.\n\nExperts did expect that pasteurization would render H5N1 inert, as it has for many other infectious germs. So the results aren't too surprising. But given the unprecedented spread of bird flu in dairy cows, it was nonetheless important to know for sure. And we certainly aren't out of the woods yet. The mere discovery of H5N1 in store-bought milk, coupled with genetic evidence of its arrival in cows months before anyone knew, strongly suggests that these outbreaks are far larger than our current data shows.\n\nBird flu is always a potentially serious threat in part because flu strains native to birds are less familiar to the immune system of humans and other mammals. Right now, these viruses can't transmit well between people. But the longer that H5N1 is able to linger in cows, the greater the likelihood that some strains will adapt and become better at spreading between mammals, humans included.

It had never been known to infect cattle in the United States before.\n\nSince then, the virus has been detected in herds in eight other states, most recently in Colorado. That spread has been caused by the movement of dairy cows from infected herds to previously unaffected herds.\n\nGenetic testing revealed that wild birds initially infected cattle with the virus, but the USDA has found evidence that it has since spread from cow to cow and from cattle to poultry. At least one infected dairy cow had no symptoms of illness.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced last week that fragments of the virus have been detected in the nation's commercial milk supply even though milk from sick cows is barred from distribution. On Wednesday, it said testing has confirmed that pasteurization -- a process of heating milk to kill pathogens -- inactivates the virus.\n\nTests of milk, cottage cheese and sour cream \"did not detect any live, infectious virus,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe FDA strongly warned against drinking raw milk. Some states, including Iowa, have sought in recent years to expand the unpasteurized milk's availability for purchase.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the USDA said tests of ground beef in states where the virus has been detected showed no evidence of the virus. Dairy cattle are often slaughtered for their meat when their milk production drops.\n\nStarting this week, the department requires most lactating dairy cattle to test negative for the virus before they can be transported to different states.\n\nIowa will require labs to report all confirmations of the virus regardless of the animal species, said Dr. Jeff Kaisand, the state veterinarian and a bureau chief for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\n\nFor now, IDALS will not quarantine dairy farms if their cattle are infected, Kaisand said. Most states have taken a similar approach, he said.\n\nDr. Yuko Sato, an ISU professor who has researched the virus in poultry, said dairy farmers should take more precautions than what might be required by government officials. She said a bird flu outbreak in 2015 was largely driven by farm-to-farm spread that was the result of insufficient biosecurity measures. About 33 million poultry were culled in Iowa that year.\n\n\"We waited for the federal government to give us guidance, so we kind of sat on our hands a little bit,\" she said. \"I encourage the dairy industry to take a proactive stance and try to look at creative solutions, because we're learning as we speak.\"\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is often lethal to poultry -- especially chickens

But they underscore the possibility that as the outbreak continues, the virus may evolve in ways that would allow it to spread easily between people, experts said.\n\n\"Flu mutates all the time -- it's what, sort of, flu does,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who was not involved in the work.\n\n\"The real key would be if we start to see some of these mutations getting more prevalent,\" Webby said. \"That would raise the risk level.\"\n\nThe virus, called H5N1, has infected cows in at least 36 herds in nine states, raising fears that milk could be infectious -- concerns now largely put to rest -- and highlighting the risk that many viruses might jump across species on crowded farms.\n\nThe study was posted online Wednesday and has not been peer reviewed. It is among the first to provide details of a Department of Agriculture investigation that has been mostly opaque until now, frustrating experts outside the government.\n\nThe outbreak most likely began about four months before it was confirmed in late March, and spread undetected through cows that had no visible symptoms, the researchers found. That timing is consistent with estimates from genetic analyses by other scientists.\n\nThe virus has been detected in some dairy herds with no known links to affected farms, the authors said, supporting the idea of transmission from cows without symptoms and suggesting there might be infected herds that have not yet been identified.\n\nThe widespread nature of the outbreak also suggests efficient spread among the cows, according to the new paper. That may pose significant risks to the people who interact closely with those animals,\n\n\"The fact that this has been transmitting in cows for a while is definitely concerning,\" said Louise Moncla, an evolutionary biologist who studies avian influenza at the University of Pennsylvania and was not involved in the work.\n\n\"I'm very much worried about making sure that we find cases in people,\" she said.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers collected samples containing virus from 26 dairy farms in eight states. Cows are not typically susceptible to this type of influenza, but H5N1 appears to have acquired mutations in late 2023 that allowed it to jump from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle, the researchers said.\n\nThe virus then appears to have spread on dairy farms from Texas to Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. In at least a dozen instances since then, H5N1 has also spilled from cows back into wild birds, and into poultry, domestic cats and a raccoon.\n\nThe findings should prompt large-scale surveillance not just of affected farms but also those without reported infections, said Dr. Diego Diel, a virus expert at Cornell University and an author of the study.\n\nMany of the other species were probably infected after coming into contact with contaminated milk, which can contain very high levels of the virus, Diel said. A separate study published earlier this week reported that about a dozen cats that were fed raw milk had died.\n\nIt is not uncommon for dairies to dump discarded milk into manure pits or lagoons. That \"could definitely serve as a source of infection to other susceptible species,\" he said.\n\nResearchers are closely monitoring H5N1 genetic sequences from cows for mutations that would allow the virus to infect or spread among mammals, including humans, more easily.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children's_Research_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raccoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_2024-05-03T165011Z_3_LYNXMPEK420GQ_RTROPTP_4_HEALTH-BIRD-FLU-CONTAINMENT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Initially discovered in dairy farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico, there are now 36 confirmed outbreaks in dairy herds in nine states.\n\nAlthough the H5N1 virus circulates widely in wild birds, it is now circulating among dairy cattle in the US. The USDA has confirmed transmission between cows in the same herd, from cows to birds, and between different dairy cattle herds.\n\nBut the reported outbreaks are likely to be a major underestimation of the true spread of the virus, says James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. \"It's likely there is going to be a fair amount of underreporting and underdiagnosis,\" he says.\n\nTests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of retail milk samples might give some indication of how widespread the virus is. The agency found viral fragments in one in five samples of commercial milk, although this virus had been deactivated by pasteurization so was not infectious.\n\nSo far there is only one confirmed human infection in the outbreak: someone in Texas who had close contact with dairy cattle. Their only reported symptom was conjunctivitis, and the individual was told to isolate themselves and take an antiviral drug for flu. But anecdotal reports of illness on dairy farms hints that infections among humans may be more widespread than official data suggests. Although human infections have tended to be rare, the virus is dangerous -- just over half of the human cases recorded by the World Health Organization over the past two decades have been fatal.\n\nDairy workers are most at risk of possible infection in the current outbreak, but understanding the extent of any infections is extremely tricky, says James Lawler, professor of infectious diseases at University of Nebraska Medical Center. More than half of workers in the US dairy industry are immigrants, and many of them are undocumented.\n\nThese undocumented workers are unlikely to want to put themselves at risk by coming for testing, Lawler says. \"There's an inherent disincentive that many of the workers, because of their status as undocumented immigrants, are not raising their hands.\" The result, Lawler says, is that it's difficult for scientists to track any possible spread of the virus through humans.\n\nAnother issue is incentivizing owners of dairy farms to report when their animals seem sick. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service specifically provides payments for poultry farmers who have to kill their livestock due to bird flu infections. Dairy farmers don't get compensated for reporting infections, which incentivizes producers to keep quiet, upping the risk that outbreaks get out of hand and spread to other cattle or farm workers.\n\nThis presents a major problem for tracking the spread of the disease. \"From the perspective of a producer, how is it going to benefit them to share or even test and understand if there's a virus circulating in their herd?\" Lawler says.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type":

While it appears to cause milder infections in cows, H5N1 has also been linked to stunning death rates of 50 per cent or more in other species, including various birds, cats and even humans (new window), though more data and research is needed to fully understand the risks.\n\nI think we're way behind the virus, warned Matthew Miller, an immunologist and vaccine developer with McMaster University, who's among the Canadians working on H5N1 research.\n\nWithout a robust national surveillance program, there's no way to know if there are infections here or not.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) told CBC News on Monday it has not detected this form of bird flu yet in dairy cattle -- or any other livestock -- in Canada. (In birds, however, the disease is already widespread (new window) across (new window) the country (new window), impacting an estimated 11 million farmed birds (new window) to date.)\n\nThe disease is federally reportable in any species, cattle included, the CFIA said. The agency requires dairy producers to monitor for signs of infection, follow biosecurity measures, and contact their local CFIA office if there is a high degree of suspicion of the disease.\n\nIt appears that cross-country trade is still allowed. Asked whether dairy cattle can currently be transported between the U.S. and Canada, the CFIA said the World Organisation of Animal Health does not recommend restrictions on the movement of healthy cattle and their products at this time.\n\nAs well, following a U.S. federal order last Wednesday requiring H5N1 testing for many dairy cattle moving between states, Canada will also require testing for [avian flu] on imported lactating dairy cattle from the U.S., the CFIA said.\n\nWhen asked about testing milk samples, the agency said if H5N1 is detected in Canadian cattle, it will help provide testing support.\n\n(The agency was more clear in an earlier statement on social media (new window), saying it is not currently testing raw or pasteurized milk, adding that the virus isn't a food safety concern.)\n\nMultiple Canadian scientists, however, stress that widespread testing and surveillance efforts should already be underway rather than set to ramp up after a first detection.\n\nCanada should absolutely be doing active surveillance for H5N1 in cattle, other animals and humans who are in close contact with them, said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert with the University Health Network in Toronto, in correspondence with CBC News.\n\nHe said those efforts could include a range of approaches such as wastewater surveillance, blood sample studies and nasal swabs.\n\nThe goal should be going all-in on prevention, Miller said, adding pandemics always have the highest risk of happening when we have a virus in animals that humans are heavily exposed to.\n\nGiven H5N1's unprecedented leap into cattle, followed by explosive cow-to-cow spread across the U.S. in mere weeks, the potential for human-to-human transmission seems more likely as the virus adapts to more mammals, he warned.\n\nIf we see more human infections, cat's out of the bag, it's way too late, Miller said. We need to be sparing no amount of effort, and no amount of expense, in doing absolutely everything to prevent even those initial infections in humans -- because the stakes are just too high.\n\nThe U.S. has reported one human infection linked to the cattle outbreaks so far, in an individual whose only symptom was eye inflammation. However, some scientists have warned there are likely more that aren't being detected, amid growing calls for mass testing on farms (new window).\n\nWATCH | Texan contracts bird flu:\n\nA person in Texas who had close contact with infected dairy cattle has been diagnosed with bird flu. It's the country's second known human case after the virus was discovered circulating among dairy cows across at least four U.S. states for the first time.\n\nSince the issue in the [U.S.] seems to be bigger than we thought and was brewing before it was recognized, and since we have a plausible route for exposure here, we should be proactive, said Dr. Scott Weese, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College and director of the University of Guelph's Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses.\n\nAt a minimum, he added, that would involve milk surveillance. It may not be particularly sensitive -- the milk supply is diluted because it comes from so many farms, Weese said.\n\nBut if there are positives, we know we have it and then need to look more aggressively at the farm level.\n\nDespite sick cows being pulled from production lines, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said its recent nationwide survey of milk sold on store shelves found viral remnants of H5N1 in one in five samples (new window). (More reassuringly, federal tests suggest pasteurization -- a heating process meant to neutralize harmful pathogens -- does ensure milk is safe to drink.)\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also announced there will be testing of ground beef in states with bird flu outbreaks, and recently warned the virus may be passing back and forth between cattle and poultry farms.\n\nThe first known cattle infected with H5N1 were reported in late March. Since then, at least 34 herds across nine U.S. states have been impacted, and scientists suspect the outbreak is already far bigger than official figures suggest.\n\nNewly released research (new window) from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also showed profound impacts on farm cats -- with a death rate of around 50 per cent among those fed raw milk products from infected cows.\n\nThe study raises new concerns regarding the potential for virus spread within mammal populations, the team continued.\n\nWATCH | Quebec poultry industry suffers avian flu outbreaks:\n\nA Quebec poultry farmer is taking extra precautions to protect his livelihood and livestock as the province grapples with avian flu outbreaks that have killed almost one million birds in the past year.\n\nOn Monday, other U.S. researchers shared a preprint (new window) -- research not yet formally published or peer-reviewed -- outlining efforts to monitor influenza A at dozens of wastewater sites this spring.\n\nThe team tested samples from three plants where spring rises in influenza A were observed, and found a marker for the H5 gene at all three facilities. Those plants were also located in an unnamed state with confirmed H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cattle, and two of the facilities discharged animal waste and milk byproducts into sewers, the researchers noted.\n\nIt all paints a picture of a fast-spreading outbreak that's impacting new species, appearing in new areas, and is likely past the point of containing, several outside scientists agreed.\n\nHere in Canada, funding and support for veterinarians and farmers to test needs to be clear, stressed Weese.\n\nIf farmers have to pay for sampling and testing, and don't know what will happen if there's a positive, and have no direct personal gain from it, why would they do it voluntarily? he questioned. We need a clear program that supports good testing and supports farms.\n\nToronto-based infectious diseases specialist Dr. Allison McGeer, from Sinai Health System, said she's personally hoping we are not going to get caught off guard here in Canada.\n\nWhat's reassuring, McGeer added, is that Canada does have robust human testing in place to catch severe flu infections. Typically, she says, Canadian hospitals use combined viral testing -- for COVID, influenza and RSV -- which can pick up a certain protein that is stable across all strains of influenza A.\n\nIf a human infection of avian flu showed up in a hospital, the test would label it along the lines of influenza A, subtype not detected, she explained. And, if the patient had also been in contact with poultry or wildlife, that combination of factors could trigger extra lab work to pinpoint the specific type of influenza -- including H5N1.\n\nBut that's only if someone is sick enough to visit a healthcare facility.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Further testing narrowed that diagnosis down to H5N1.\n\nThe man's condition didn't worsen, but he was given a standard antiviral medication, oseltamivir, twice daily for five days, and was told to isolate at home. People living in his home were also given the antiviral to protect them from H5N1.\n\nMore from this section Taylor County Health News: Frequent Vaping in Teens Linked to Increased Metal Exposure.

Doctor Explains\n\n\"Over the subsequent days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms, and household contacts remained well,\" the team wrote.\n\nClose laboratory inspection of the strain implicated in the man's infection reveal a key viral mutation, called PB2 E627K. This mutation \"has been associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts and detected previously in humans and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThey added that the man's H5N1 strain showed no evidence of mutations that might make it any less responsive to treatment with standard antivirals recommended against influenza.\n\nAnd there was good news for scientists developing avian influenza vaccines, should they become necessary: Specific vaccine-sensitive components of the strain of H5N1 that infected the dairy worker are \"closely related\" to viruses already being studied by bird flu vaccine researchers.\n\n\"Because influenza A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, these candidate vaccine viruses are available to manufacturers and could be used to produce vaccine if needed,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThe latest data on the outbreak of bird flu among U.S. dairy cows has detected infection in 36 herds across nine states. Tests conducted by federal health officials have found evidence of inactive DNA \"fragments\" of H5N1 in about 1 in 20 samples of milk, but no live virus -- it is thought that pasteurization kills the virus. Tests of ground beef have also turned up negative for the virus.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about H5N1 avian flu at the CDC.\n\nSOURCE: New England Journal of Medicine, May 3, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nThe only known human case of H5N1 avian flu linked to the ongoing outbreak among U.S. dairy cows was mild and resolved using a standard antiviral.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasal cavity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vital signs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/5c/65cce0df-6f26-50a8-a027-ed83d0cbc8f7/6634ffd252425.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C54&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1254, "textEnd": 1259}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

in a nearby farm with a confirmed outbreak of the virus, according to new details on the case released on Friday.\n\nThe details, reported online in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscore the risk to farm workers in the ongoing outbreak among U.S. dairy cattle and the need to wear protective gear to avoid infection.\n\nThe outbreak - the first in cattle - is so far known to have infected 36 dairy herds in nine states.\n\nAMID BIRD FLU SPREAD, EXPERTS REVEAL IF IT'S SAFE TO DRINK MILK: 'INDIRECT CONCERN'\n\nInfection by the bird virus is rare in humans, and the dairy worker's case, first reported in March, represents only the second known human infection in the United States.\n\nIt follows a worrisome spread of the virus in a variety of mammal species, raising concerns that widespread exposure of people could cause the virus to spread more easily among the population and spark a global pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the report said the farm worker developed a serious infection in his right eye known as conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but had no signs of respiratory infection or fever.\n\nThe worker had not reported any contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but did have close exposure with sick dairy cows, with symptoms such as decreased milk production, reduced appetite and lethargy.\n\nThe worker had been wearing gloves but no respiratory or eye protection.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe CDC is urging farmers, workers, and emergency responders to wear appropriate protective gear when in direct or close physical contact with sick birds, livestock, feces, raw milk or contaminated surfaces.\n\nAn analysis of the outbreak released on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests the virus has been circulating in U.S. dairy cows for about four months before being reported on March 25.\n\nPreliminary tests of milk, baby formula and other dairy products suggests they

Namely, how far this H5N1 virus has spread, how it is spreading, and where this situation is likely to go next. The COVID-weary public also wants to know whether humans are at risk.\n\nPublic agencies must move faster and collaborate more efficiently to answer some of those unknowns. After all, this is a pathogen that has loomed large in the minds of infectious disease experts for its potential to cause a deadly human pandemic.\n\n\"It's fair to say for every question we've had answered in the last month, we have 10 to 15 new questions,\" says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota.\n\nAmong the most essential: Just how widespread is this outbreak?\n\nThe seriousness of the situation escalated after scientists found viral fragments in milk on grocery store shelves -- including in states that had not reported infected herds. The Food and Drug Administration eventually said it had detected H5N1 fragments in one out of every five of the commercial milk samples it tested.\n\nThat suggests the virus has been circulating in cows longer and more easily than anyone realized. Genetic sleuths have traced the outbreak back to a likely spillover event in late 2023, when a wild bird may have infected a cow on a farm.\n\nWidespread testing is essential to understanding the outbreak's true scope -- and to have any hope of containing it. But that's easier said than done. Consider that tens of thousands of cows are being moved around the country any given week, says Keith Poulsen, Director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't test them all, so we need to test where it's going to be logistically easy to accomplish.\"\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture recently said cows could not be moved between states without a negative H5N1 test, and expanded the amount of testing it will pay for. But the agency is still only requiring farms to test a few dozen cows out of each group, an approach that is not sufficient to stop the spread.\n\nPaulsen and others are working on methods to test bulk milk, but need to ensure they are sensitive enough to pick up even one infected cow out of a pool of milk from as many as two thousand. Because even asymptomatic cows seem to be shedding so much virus in their milk, he thinks that's feasible.\n\nWhich leads us to another seemingly simple, yet still elusive question: How exactly is the virus spreading among cows?\n\nOn a recent call with state public health officials, USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Rosemary Sifford noted that transmission is mostly occurring within cows who are lactating, but it's unclear if the spread primarily is happening through the milking process itself or because a cow with a high viral load in their milk is passing it onto others. The USDA has said that anything that comes in contact with milk, whether that's a human, another animal, a vehicle or fomites, could spread the virus and that it's likely occurring in more than one way.\n\nSo far, the virus really seems to be largely in the mammary glands, though the USDA has found evidence of the virus in the respiratory tract of one cow (though it's unclear how many nasal swabs are being performed). The agency is currently conducting transmission studies in cattle that could inform mitigation efforts.\n\nOf course, everyone is wondering what the coming weeks and months will look like -- for herds, for our food supply, for other livestock and, of course, for humans.\n\nTo help answer that, attention should focus on the Texas panhandle, where the outbreak was first detected. Those herds might provide important clues about what the coming months could look like. \"Maybe the simplest question is: When a herd 'recovers,' what does it mean?,\" asks Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.\n\nWe need to know whether cows generate sufficient immunity to ward off another infection, how long that immunity might last, and how widespread that immunity might be. That will mean looking for antibodies to the virus in herds around the country, regardless of whether there was a known outbreak there. Clarity on immunity will help shape future mitigation and monitoring efforts.\n\nWhich leads us to the questions most relevant to the general public: Am I safe?\n\nLet's start with the food supply. The FDA's tests have shown pasteurized milk is safe to drink. (Raw milk, on the other hand, should be absolutely avoided.) And the USDA, which maintains the meat supply is safe, nevertheless is currently conducting tests of both ground beef on grocery shelves and at processing facilities, to understand whether evidence of the virus exists there, too. The agency is also looking at what happens to meat infected in a lab and then cooked at different temperatures.\n\nThen there's the worry of infection. Osterholm, who has been following H5N1 for nearly three decades now, reiterates that despite this new twist of widespread infections in cows, the risk to humans remains low. But \"that should not leave us complacent,\" he says. \"All can change in a heartbeat.\"\n\nSome scientists are working behind the scenes to prepare in case the virus adapts to infect humans. So far, the same antivirals used for the seasonal flu, such as Tamiflu, seem likely to work against H5N1. Meanwhile, two vaccine candidates against H5N1 seem somewhat effective against viral samples taken from infected cows, and enough raw materials exist to make limited doses if needed.\n\nBut the caveats are many. For example, our flu treatments aren't great to begin with -- to be effective, they must be taken within a very short window of developing symptoms. And there's reason to worry that our existing vaccines might be far less helpful if the virus adapted to infect people. Researchers are working on newer antivirals and vaccine strategies, but those efforts are nascent and wouldn't do much for us if the situation suddenly took a more serious turn.\n\nIt's important to keep pushing for answers and transparency. The stakes are too high to let the questions keep piling up.\n\n____\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nLisa Jarvis is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, health care and the pharmaceutical industry.

It was published an open-access preprint\n\nserver for the biological sciences called bioRxivon.\n\nMembers of USDA's network of laboratories that monitors for diseases identified influenza A virus, which includes bird flu, in milk and nasal swabs from cows at a Texas dairy, the paper said, without specifying a date.\n\nThey forwarded samples to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, which respond to animal-health emergencies, for testing as epidemiologic investigations continued elsewhere, the paper said.\n\nUSDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Overall, it's wonderful that these data have been shared,\" virologist Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, who worked on sequencing the virus with Worobey, said in a post on X.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Polansek and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The livestock exhibited similar symptoms to cows in northern Texas that were diagnosed with the H5N1 virus, according to a medical report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe patient was quickly diagnosed with the bird flu strain Type A H5N1, which is spreading rapidly among livestock.\n\nDoctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which initially diagnosed the unidentified person, released a photo as part of the report on Friday. It outlined the symptoms and showed the patient's bloodshot eyes severely hemorrhaged.\n\nThe right eye, which experienced the fluid drainage, was especially red.\n\nThe worker wore gloves but no face mask or eye protection when he dealt with the animals, according to doctors.\n\nThe virus appeared to infect only the farmhand's eyes and luckily didn't spread to his lungs.\n\nThe patient had no changes in vision, fever or other any other symptoms and the fiery pinkeye cleared up within days, according to the report.\n\nThe mild case isn't guaranteed -- while some people don't develop any noticeable symptoms, others can come down with severe, life-threatening pneumonia.\n\nAround 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization, and some experts fear the real threat would come if there are further mutations.\n\nThe patient was told to isolate and was treated with an antiviral drug for the flu, according to the CDC.\n\nThe agency said in a release on April 1 that the threat to the general public remains low despite the infection, but those with close or prolonged exposure to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk. Authorities also insist the nation's meat dairy supply is not at risk.\n\nThe Texas worker became the second person in the US to contract the virus, according to federal and state officials.\n\nThe latest diagnosis came a week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with the virus. Herds in Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico have since tested positive for bird flu. Thirty-six total dairy herds were affected as of Thursday, according to the CDC.\n\nThe first human infection was in 2022, when a prison inmate contracted the disease while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Colorado.\n\nIt's the first time the avian flu has been found in cattle but it has thrived in more mammals in recent years, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",

He points out that \"clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis\" has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one.\n\nLuckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans.\n\nStill, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerened some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus.\n\n\"I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,\" says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. \"We just don't really know.\"\n\nThere have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThese people are in \"the footprints of where the bovine detections are,\" says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations.\n\n\"There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,\" he adds.\n\nThe lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit.\n\nBut the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,\" says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture.\n\nAlso, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, \"possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.\"\n\nThe federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring.\n\nHowever, there still remain \"serious gaps\" in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. \"There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.\"\n\nOnly complicating matters -- the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture.\n\n\"Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,\" says Bowman.\n\nThe health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC.\n\nFederal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock.\n\nBut even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak.\n\n\"I worry that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,\" says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing.\n\nFill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and \"not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.\"\n\nTo get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans.\n\nDr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,\" says Young,regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo.\n\nGray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons -- their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers \"to wave the flag\" that there are infections.\n\nThe farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus \"a huge priority,\" but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says.\n\nDr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis.\n\nDairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds -- unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners.\n\n\"So what is their incentive to report?\" he says, \"It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.\"\n\nGray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover on farms.\n\nThey'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.\n\nWhat concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm.\n\n\"We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,\" he says, \"The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The details, reported online in the New England Journal of Medicine, underscore the risk to farm workers in the ongoing outbreak among U.S. dairy cattle and the need to wear protective gear to avoid infection.\n\nThe outbreak - the first in cattle - is so far known to have infected 36 dairy herds in nine states. Infection by the bird virus is rare in humans, and the dairy worker's case, first reported in March, represents only the second known human infection in the United States.\n\nIt follows a worrisome spread of the virus in a variety of mammal species, raising concerns that widespread exposure of people could cause the virus to spread more easily among the population and spark a global pandemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the report said the farm worker developed a serious infection in his right eye known as conjunctivitis, or pink eye, but had no signs of respiratory infection or fever.\n\nThe worker had not reported any contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but did have close exposure with sick dairy cows, with symptoms such as decreased milk production, reduced appetite and lethargy. The worker had been wearing gloves but no respiratory or eye protection.\n\nThe CDC is urging farmers, workers, and emergency responders to wear appropriate protective gear when in direct or close physical contact with sick birds, livestock, feces, raw milk or contaminated surfaces. An analysis of the outbreak released on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests the virus has been circulating in U.S. dairy cows for about four months before being reported on March 25.\n\nPreliminary tests of milk, baby formula and other dairy products suggests they are safe to consume, according to the FDA.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethargy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lethargy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fomite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appetite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_23_14_7012518.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1920, "textEnd": 1928}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Further testing narrowed that diagnosis down to H5N1.\n\nThe man's condition didn't worsen, but he was given a standard antiviral medication, oseltamivir, twice daily for five days, and was told to isolate at home. People living in his home were also given the antiviral to protect them from H5N1.\n\n\"Over the subsequent days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms, and household contacts remained well,\" the team wrote.\n\nClose laboratory inspection of the strain implicated in the man's infection reveal a key viral mutation, called PB2 E627K. This mutation \"has been associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts and detected previously in humans and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThey added that the man's H5N1 strain showed no evidence of mutations that might make it any less responsive to treatment with standard antivirals recommended against influenza.\n\nAnd there was good news for scientists developing avian influenza vaccines, should they become necessary: Specific vaccine-sensitive components of the strain of H5N1 that infected the dairy worker are \"closely related\" to viruses already being studied by bird flu vaccine researchers.\n\n\"Because influenza A(H5N1) viruses have pandemic potential, these candidate vaccine viruses are available to manufacturers and could be used to produce vaccine if needed,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThe latest data on the outbreak of bird flu among U.S. dairy cows has detected infection in 36 herds across nine states. Tests conducted by federal health officials have found evidence of inactive DNA \"fragments\" of H5N1 in about 1 in 20 samples of milk, but no live virus -- it is thought that pasteurization kills the virus.

There have been 13 cases of cats dying from it -- six feral and seven domesticated. However, Davis warned dog owners to exercise caution as well. Working animals living on a farm are at the highest risk, and their owners should try to keep their pets away from dairy cows or poultry.\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds, but the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes be transferred to mammals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\nA \"multistate outbreak\" of the virus has emerged among dairy cattle since mid-March, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cases have been confirmed in humans.\n\nDavis added: \"A lot of rural farmers keep guard dogs for poultry and other livestock.\" And she said, even though the dogs have likely been exposed to the flu for years since its emergence in 2021, there are no documented cases of dogs dying from the virus.\n\nDavis urged pet owners to avoid feeding their pets raw milk, as consuming the milk from an infected cow can cause illness even if the person or their pet doesn't live on a farm.\n\n\"If you are someone who purchases raw milk for consumption at home, take great caution with pets and raw milk,\" Davis said. \"It's not recommended that anyone in the household consume raw milk products.\"\n\nGenetic traces of bird flu virus have been identified in 1 out of 5 samples of retail milk, but the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) isn't concerned when it comes to pasteurized products. Traces of the virus's DNA doesn't mean the milk contains active forms of the virus itself. The FDA conducted additional testing to determine if any infectious virus was present in the samples.\n\n\"This additional testing did not detect any live, infectious virus,\" the agency said in a statement on April 26. \"These results reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\"\n\nPets also can be exposed to avian influenza directly through an infected bird, specifically animals such as cats or dogs that hunt and then eat an infected bird, Davis warned.\n\nFerret owners also should take caution to keep their pets safe. \"We recognize that ferrets are likely to be highly susceptible,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_skinner@newsweek.com", "name": "Anna Skinner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raw milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working animal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Bloomberg_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2387989/bird-flu-sparks-warning-pet-owners.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fc4c80e900a64581ca7fcdf9b43b935b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2384, "textEnd": 2392}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

While the infection normally spreads in avian species, it can also spill over into other animals, including humans, which has sparked fears of a global animal pandemic. What exactly is going on?\n\nThe current outbreak - which involves the H5N1 variant - began in 2020 and has resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, as well as wild birds across the globe.\n\nIn recent months, we have seen an increasing number of reports of infections in mammals - cows, goats, cats, and even a polar bear and a bottlenose dolphin have all tested positive for bird flu. Then, last month, it was reported that a person in Texas had contracted the virus after coming into contact with dairy cattle presumed to be infected. This was only the second person ever confirmed to have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in the US.\n\nAs of Tuesday, nine US states had reported outbreaks in dairy cattle, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and milk has tested positive for H5N1 virus fragments. In the latest twist in the tale, the US government has announced it is testing ground beef in nine states for traces of the virus.\n\nSo, how worried should we be? Here's what the experts have to say.\n\nIn birds, H5N1 is spread via saliva, nasal secretions, and fecal matter - gross, we know - but quite how it's made its way to mammals we're not entirely sure.\n\n\"We don't know how the virus passes from birds to mammals,\" Dr James Lowe, a professor of veterinary clinical medicine at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told News Bureau life sciences editor Diana Yates in a recent interview. \"The theory is that the infected cows were exposed to infected birds and their feces. That's the most likely explanation.\"\n\nAnd that should offer some reassurance to us: \"In most cases worldwide, transmission to mammals is likely the result of scavenging by the mammal populations on infected dead birds, and represent minimal risk of further spread,\" Rowland Kao, Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, told the Science Media Centre in January.\n\nA lot of very different species have been infected, as detailed above, and all are affected differently. According to Lowe, the H5N1 virus is able to do this by interacting with sialic acid (SA) receptors on the surfaces of cells. \"Those receptors may be more prevalent in different parts of the body in different groups of animals,\" Lowe added.\n\n\"In marine mammals and some carnivorous mammals, the virus migrates to the brain to bind to SA receptors there, causing dangerous disease. In humans, the affected receptors are most abundant deep in the lungs. That's why H5N1 infection sometimes causes pneumonia in humans.\"\n\nIt sounds scary, but, according to the experts, we should avoid panicking. The CDC states that \"the current public health risk is low\", although it will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nWhile vulnerable people may experience more severe symptoms, Lowe reassures that for most people with healthy immune systems, \"infection with the H5N1 virus may be associated with mild respiratory problems, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal problems or no symptoms at all.\"\n\n\"To date, human mortality as a result of bird flu infection is extremely low.\"\n\nThere is also no evidence yet that H5N1 is spreading between humans, which is comforting.\n\nIt's one thing for a virus to infect a new species, but quite another for it to spread, as Dr Ed Hutchinson from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research told Science Media Centre.\n\n\"Importantly, there is a difference between isolated infections of a new species and a virus spreading efficiently within that species. It requires a lot of changes for a bird virus to become a mammalian virus, and at the current time there is no sign that this H5N1 virus has changed from being a dangerous virus of birds to a virus that can spread easily within any mammal species.\"\n\nAs for whether this has the potential to develop into a pandemic, Lowe says \"there's no indication at present that this will happen.\"\n\nOn May 1, the FDA issued an update on the results of a national commercial milk sampling study that \"reaffirm our assessment that the commercial milk supply is safe.\" They also state that \"pasteurization is effective in inactivating [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza] HPAI,\" preliminary testing didn't detect any \"live, infectious virus,\" and samples of powdered milk products and infant formula didn't contain virus or viral fragments.\n\nEfforts are already underway to develop vaccines and therapies, but in the meantime, the CDC recommends avoiding direct contact with wild birds, and also other animals that may be infected, particularly those that appear sick or have died.\n\nThose who work with potentially infected cattle should be especially careful and should avoid unprotected direct physical contact or close exposure to cattle and materials associated with them.\n\nThere may also be a benefit in getting a seasonal flu shot. \"There's some evidence that human exposure to other influenza viruses or flu vaccines allow the adult immune system to better recognize the threat, so there may be some cross protection there,\" Lowe explained.", "source": {"uri":

something which is of \"enormous concern,\" the World Health Organization has warned.\n\nThe report said anyone exposed to the virus \"should be monitored,\" and that those with symptoms should \"immediately isolate\".\n\nBut health officials are struggling to win the trust and cooperation of US farm workers, many of whom are reported to have refused testing of workers and animals on their farms.\n\n'Exceedingly mild' symptoms\n\nSo far, the virus has spread to 39 dairy herds in nine states -

He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a new letter about the case published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\n\nHe reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated, direct, close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.\n\nEven though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered and illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.\n\n\"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they're not going to do, is they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, who is director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\n\nStrater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick, but don't want to be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm.\n\nHealth officials in Texas said that they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu.\n\n\"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said.\n\nIn the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he and his and his close family members were given antiviral medications and they recovered without any lasting problems, the letter says.\n\nSwabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too. While his eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes -- either rubbing them with contaminated hands, or through splashes of contaminated milk -- rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, but not cells in the human airway.\n\nThe letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory.\n\nHealth officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm.\n\nThat kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected, what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all.\n\nThe CDC is currently looking for farms that will allow them to conduct such a detailed study.\n\n\"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\" the CDC said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals.

Experts are confident the meat supply is safe", "body": "By DEVI SHASTRI - AP Health Writer\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture will test ground beef for bird flu particles, though officials said Tuesday they're confident the nation's meat supply is safe.\n\nBird flu has been found in nearly three-dozen dairy herds across nine states. The new testing is the latest effort by the USDA to track and understand how the virus is spreading among livestock.\n\nTwo studies will test if particles of the bird flu virus, called Type A H5N1, is found in beef for sale in the states where dairy cows have tested positive or in the muscles of dairy cows sent to slaughter. A third will test how cooking meat at different temperatures affects the virus using a bird flu surrogate.\n\nA week ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed it found non-infectious remnants of the bird flu virus in pasteurized milk. The particles are inactive and pose no threat to consumers, experts said.\n\nScientists say there's no evidence to suggest people can get bird flu by consuming food that's been pasteurized or properly cooked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe virus was first found in dairy cows this spring, and since then, H5N1 was detected in the lung tissue of a dairy cow culled and sent to slaughter.\n\nSo far, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not seen signs that the virus is changing to be more transmissible to people. Two farmworkers have been infected with bird flu since the outbreak began.\n\nAP Health Writer JoNel Aleccia contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Should we be concerned? Particularly since Trump is polling so well after he totally botched our response to Covid?\n\nKeep in mind, Trump shut down the offices of pandemic preparedness in the White House and NSC in 2017, leaving America vulnerable to Covid; in this week's TIME magazine interview he says if he becomes president again he'll repeat that performance by shutting down the new Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR) that Congress authorized in 2022.\n\nWhen Covid first hit the world four years ago, its fatality rate among unvaccinated people (all of us, back then) was estimated at 1.4 percent (it was 20% among hospitalized patients). By August of 2023, when it had killed over 1.1 million Americans, it had declined to an estimated 0.3 percent, in part because of vaccination, herd immunity, and an apparent diminution of the virulence of the disease as it mutated across those years.\n\nBy comparison, the Spanish Flu of 1918-1920 had a fatality rate of 2.5 percent.\n\nAnd Ebola, the disease that caused Republicans to fall into hysterics when President Obama let a physician infected with the disease back into America for treatment, has a fatality rate of an estimated 50 percent, although it's mostly hit poor people in Africa with little access to modern medicine. Estimates among healthy people with access to modern medicine put the fatality rate closer to 25 percent.\n\nBut none of them can hold a candle to the bird flu.\n\nIf you have a carton of milk in your refrigerator, odds are it contains dead virus particles from the H5N1 bird flu that has an estimated fatality rate of 52 percent. Over 800 people worldwide have contracted the bird flu so far, and more than half have died. And now it's spreading through the US milk cow herd; the FDA reports particles of the virus have been detected in one-in-five milk samples nationwide.\n\nThe good news is that pasteurization entirely kills the virus; the bad news is that it's already made the jump from birds to cows, cats, dogs, and even a dolphin. How, you may wonder, did such a deadly pathogen find its way into our milk cow herd? As Zeynep Tufekci documents for The New York Times, it may well be because:\n\n\"[T]he U.S. allows farmers to feed leftover poultry bedding material -- feathers, excrement, spilled seeds -- to dairy and beef cattle as a cheap source of additional protein.\"\n\nFor the record, this is illegal in Canada and most of the rest of the developed world; because five Republicans on the Supreme Court have legalized political bribery here, however, the Big Ag industry has successfully lobbied to allow vegetarian cows to be fed bits of birds, feathers, bird feces, and straw from bird cages.\n\nThe H5N1 bird flu has been ripping through flocks all across the world, hitting the US poultry industry particularly hard: since February 2022, over 82 million birds have been destroyed because they were infected. It's a large part of why eggs have gone up so much in price.\n\nThis happened once before in a big way.\n\nBack in 1916 a bird flu started killing birds around the world. In 1918 it hit Camp Funston in Kansas as birds carrying the bird flu virus either infected farm animals in a nearby farming operation providing meat to the military base or directly infected humans via bird droppings or a similar route.\n\nOnce the virus hit a human or pig that was already infected with a garden-variety flu, the bird flu virus and the human flu virus exchanged DNA to become an entirely new and extraordinarily deadly flu: H1N1 or the so-called Spanish Flu.\n\nOf the 1.2 million men in US Army training camps in 1918, after the virus jumped from birds to humans, fully 11.8% (143,986) were hospitalized just during the first three months of its spread from March to May of that year. American soldiers then carried the virus to the killing fields of World War I, first showing up in a big way in Spain, giving it the name we know it by today.\n\nThe Spanish Flu killed an estimated 100 million people worldwide during the three years it was spreading (when the world population was a third of what it is today); Covid, by comparison, has killed an estimated 7 million people worldwide since it first began spreading in December, 2019.\n\nToday's H5N1 bird flu virus has now been found in 920 counties across all 50 states. It's also spread to mink in Europe (whose respiratory systems are so similar to ours they're used for research) and has caused seizures and death among bears in the United States.\n\nFor the H5N1 flu to move from bird-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission will only require a small mutation in the virus.\n\nIt would just have to pick up a human-friendly gene that's present in the other flu variants that currently infect people, presumably by infecting an animal or a person who's also already infected with or recovering from a \"normal\" flu. Like a poultry worker who catches the seasonal flu but goes to work anyway because he doesn't have paid sick leave.\n\nIn an eerie echo of yesteryear, Paul Digard, an influenza virologist told the Financial Times of the H5N1 virus now circulating among birds around the world:\n\n\"One concern is 'reassortment': when two flu viruses circulating in the same infected animal swap genetic material. 'H5N1 in pigs would be a very large, exceedingly red flag,' Digard warns, 'given the frequency with which humans and pigs have exchanged [flu] viruses over the last 100 years.' The respiratory tracts of pigs show similarities to ours, meaning that a swine-adapted flu virus might not require many changes to threaten us.\"\n\nOdds are if it stays as deadly as it currently is it won't spread as rapidly or as widely as a less deadly variety, simply because it would kill its hosts so quickly.\n\nBut even if its pathogenicity dropped from 52.8 percent all the way down to 2.5 percent, that would equal the Spanish Flu.\n\nTo deal with this potential crisis, America is already developing, in limited amounts, an H5N1 vaccine to inoculate workers in factory farms, slaughter, and meat-packing operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican response to the possibility of a second deadly pandemic is predictably bizarre.\n\nInstead of going along with government efforts to prepare for and even prevent another pandemic, Republican politicians -- as an apparent homage to the way Trump handled Covid -- are already trying to block public health efforts.\n\nAs KFF News reported last fall:\n\n\"'Public health is being politicized to a point that's never been seen,' said Kyle McGowan, of consulting firm Ascendant Strategic Partners, who served as chief of staff at the CDC during the Trump administration. Cutting public health spending 'is not smart,' he said. 'These culture wars are now leaking into and harming public health.'\"\n\nThe Republican proposal from the Labor, Health, and Human Services committee's appropriation for 2024 includes drastic across-the-board cuts in public health programs. As the Republicans themselves brag in a press release about the budget proposal:\n\n\"The Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill provides $147 billion for programs under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee, which is $60.3 billion (29%) below the FY23 enacted level and $73 billion below the President's Budget Request.\"\n\nIn other words, the disease may not be as big a threat to America as the GOP: Republicans in Congress just rolled out an additional new proposal that cuts fully one-sixth of the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nConnecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the subcommittee was blunt in her assessment of the GOP's plan:\n\n\"Cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are as outrageous as they are dangerous.\"\n\nBut the GOP continues to echo Trump's efforts to blame his malicious and incompetent handling of Covid on Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC, and that lie is now official doctrine within the party. For example, the Republican chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Texas Representative Kay Granger, claimed the appropriations bill, which guts the CDC:\n\n\"[W]orks to responsibly fund programs that help improve the health and lives of the American people.

He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a new letter about the case published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.\n\nHe reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated, direct, close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.\n\nEven though the man didn't become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered and illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.\n\n\"For farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what they're not going to do, is they're not going to test for something if they don't have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,\" said Elizabeth Strater, who is director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\n\nStrater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick, but don't want to be tested, but she said it's nothing that they're able to confirm.\n\nHealth officials in Texas said that they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu.\n\n\"The people tested volunteered to be tested,\" said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\"It's likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,\" Anton said.\n\nIn the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he and his and his close family members were given antiviral medications and they recovered without any lasting problems, the letter says.\n\nA farmworker who tested positive for H5N1 bird flu sought care in March for infected, swollen, red eyes. courtesy New England Journal of Medicine\n\nSwabs of the patient's eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too. While his eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, there was hardly any virus in his lungs. That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes -- either rubbing them with contaminated hands, or through splashes of contaminated milk -- rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldn't get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, but not cells in the human airway.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory.\n\nHealth officials said they couldn't do further investigation of how the man was infected because \"epidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farm\" where he worked. They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm.\n\nThat kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected, what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all.\n\nThe CDC is currently looking for farms that will allow them to conduct such a detailed study.\n\n\"Understanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,\" the CDC said in a statement to CNN. \"Discussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies.

He points out that \"clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis\" has been documented with previous outbreaks involving bird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one.\n\nLuckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans.\n\nStill, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerened some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus.\n\n\"I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,\" says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. \"We just don't really know.\"\n\nThere have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThese people are in \"the footprints of where the bovine detections are,\" says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations.\n\n\"There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,\" he adds.\n\nThe lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit.\n\nBut the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,\" says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture.\n\nAlso, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, \"possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.\"\n\nThe federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring.\n\nHowever, there still remain \"serious gaps\" in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. \"There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.\"\n\nOnly complicating matters -- the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture.\n\n\"Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,\" says Bowman.\n\nThe health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC.\n\nFederal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock.\n\nBut even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak.\n\n\"I worry that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,\" says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing.\n\nFill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and \"not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.\"\n\nTo get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans.\n\nDr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,\" says Young, regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo.\n\nGray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons -- their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers \"to wave the flag\" that there are infections.\n\nThe farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus \"a huge priority,\" but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says.\n\nDr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis.\n\nDairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds -- unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners.\n\n\"So what is their incentive to report?\" he says, \"It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.\"\n\nGray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover on farms.\n\nThey'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.\n\nWhat concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm.\n\n\"We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,\" he says, \"The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater.\"", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [],

But previous human cases were all linked to transmission from infected birds, typically domestic poultry.\n\nThe report, published Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine, details the unidentified man's symptoms and his possible route of infection. It was written by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Texas Tech University Bioterrorism Response Laboratory in Lubbock.\n\nHow the man became infected cannot be proven; while the cattle on the farm where he worked reportedly suffered from a decline in milk and other symptoms seen in herds that have tested positive for H5N1, no animal testing at that farm was undertaken. The authors noted, though, that nearby farms where dairy cows experienced the same symptoms tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"Given the infected human was a dairy farm worker with reported exposure to sick, presumably infected cows in Texas and without reported exposure to other mammals or birds, we believe the genetic and epidemiologic data are strong evidence of infection of the human following exposure to presumably HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected cows,\" they wrote in the supplementary materials that accompanied their report.\n\nHPAI A(H5N1) is scientific shorthand for highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype. The term \"highly pathogenic\" applies only to how the virus behaves when it infects poultry, though people might easily assume it applies more broadly, given how deadly this virus has proven to be over the decades. Roughly half of the people known to have been infected died. It kills wild birds and dozens of mammalian species, including cats (domestic and large cats), seals, foxes, mink, and many other scavenging carnivores that have had the misfortune of consuming infected wild birds.\n\nIn the report the authors describe, the man's illness was exceedingly mild. His lungs were clear and he had no trouble breathing; he had no fever. His sole symptom appeared to be conjunctivitis, a condition colloquially known as pink eye.\n\nThe man and people he lived with were given flu antiviral drugs. He reported that his conjunctivitis cleared up. None of the people he lived with became sick.\n\nIdeally in cases like this, scientists would draw blood from the man and his contacts, as well as from other people working on the farm, to look for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. Presence of antibodies among other farm workers might suggest the virus is passing to people more commonly than has been seen. Antibodies in the blood of the man's contacts could indicate that he transmitted the infection to them, but that their cases were so mild they didn't have symptoms.\n\nBut this work was not done, the report said, because the man and his contacts would not agree to have blood drawn. \"We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts,\" they said. Likewise it appears that health authorities were not allowed on the farm to investigate whether more workers might have been infected.\n\nThe authors report that nasal swabs taken from the man also showed presence of virus, but at much lower levels than what was found in his conjunctiva, the tissue surrounding the eye.\n\nThey hypothesize that the man could have been infected by one of two routes. Either virus in the air in the milking parlor landed in his eyes -- reportedly he did not wear eye protection -- or he may have had virus on his hands or gloves and transferred it to his eye inadvertently, they suggested.\n\nAnalysis of the genetic sequence of the virus retrieved from this man has shown that while it is closely related to the viruses that have been causing the cow outbreaks, it does not fit neatly into the viral family tree that scientists studying the sequences have developed. The authors suggested that it's possible the virus was from a slightly different offshoot that has died off; alternatively, there could have been more than one spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle region where these outbreaks were first observed.\n\nTo date 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus, though it is believed that many more have experienced outbreaks but have not been tested. Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC have acknowledged that farmers have often refused to cooperate with their efforts to investigate these outbreaks.\n\nThe report noted that the virus from the man was closely related, genetically, to the viruses used to produce two batches of H5N1 vaccine that the U.S. government has made and stockpiled as a hedge against a bird flu pandemic. The stockpiled vaccine, of which there are about 10 million doses, \"would likely afford immune protection in people if used as vaccines,\" the authors concluded.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_branswell@statnews.com", "name": "Helen Branswell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Tech_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Tech University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bioterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_2499-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

It's Not a Dire Threat for Most of Us  --  Yet. - RocketNews", "body": "Headlines are flying after the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the H5N1 bird flu virus has infected dairy cows around the country. Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event held by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"\n\nViruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.\n\nWith that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.\n\nQ: Who gets the bird flu?\n\nMainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom. At least 24,000 sea lions died in outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in South America last year.\n\nWhat makes the current out ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Menagerie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bush dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 366}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Some farm cats that have drunk raw and infected milk have died.\n\nDr Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, told The Telegraph the genetics of the flu strain in cattle in the US \"have changed a bit\" but not to the point of concern.\n\n\"It doesn't seem to have become greatly more infectious for people and transmissible to people,\" she said. \"I think that's supported by the fact that only one person has been confirmed with the disease.\n\n\"The public should also hopefully be reassured that [the US] is testing and this is what they're seeing, and it's being shared.\"\n\nThe Government's Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance group (HAIRS), which brings together public health and veterinary disease experts to assess the threat to both animals and people, has been convened to discuss the evolving situation, The Telegraph can reveal.\n\nLow risk for people\n\nThe most recent HAIRS report for avian influenza was published in July 2023 and came in the wake of clade 2.3.4.4b of the H5N1 virus running rampant in wild bird populations and poultry farms.\n\nIt found the risk to the UK general population was \"very low\", \"low\" for people who work with healthy birds, and there is also a \"low\" risk of the virus to non-bird animals.\n\nA new report has now been drafted and is understood to be published in a matter of weeks. It will include a new genetic analysis of the bovine-borne virus, the risk of spillover to people and the threat to health.\n\nProf James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, told The Telegraph the type of bird flu in the US cattle ranches is a combination of the potent H5N1 strain that recently spread globally and a different bird flu strain circulating in North America.\n\n\"This virus appears to have emerged (reassorted) several months ago,\" he said. \"Because this effectively is a new virus, there is a lot of uncertainty around what its characteristics are.\"\n\nDr Middlemiss said these developments have been considered by HAIRS in the last few weeks \"as this new information has emerged\".\n\n\"They have looked specifically at the risk of what this means, including the risk of transmission from animals to people,\" she told the Telegraph in an exclusive interview at the Animal and Plant Health Agency headquarters and laboratories in Weybridge.\n\n\"Their report is in draft but it will be coming out soon. They have specifically looked at this issue. HAIRS is our animal and public health experts and they have looked very closely at it.\"\n\nShe added that the UK imports \"a tiny amount\" of milk products from the US, and none of it is raw.\n\nDr Middlemiss said colleagues in the US are sending over real-time information on the genetic changes of the virus and there is ongoing monitoring.\n\nThreats 'appear to be contained'\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has reportedly set up an emergency response team in Whitehall to monitor the situation and has not committed to testing domestic cattle.\n\nSome scientists have criticised the government's reluctance to test milk or cows in the UK, but Prof Wood said the fact there is no importation of high-risk products protects Britain from the new form of bird flu in the US.\n\n\"The immediate public and animal health threats to us in the UK appear to be contained, but very close attention to the situation is warranted,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the genome of the new hybrid virus does have some adaptations that make it better at infecting mammals, \"but nothing startling has been observed\".\n\nProf Wood also called the approach of the UK Government, which has pushed back on calls for ramped-up testing in Britain, \"proportionate and sensible\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

He points out that \"clustering of flu-like illness and conjunctivitis\" has been documentedwith previousoutbreaks involvingbird flu strains that are lethal for poultry like this current one.\n\nLuckily, genetic sequencing of the virus doesn't indicate it has evolved to easily spread among humans.\n\nStill, epidemiologists say it's critical to track any possible cases. They're concerened some human infections could be flying under the radar, especially if they are mild and transient as was seen in the Texas dairy worker who caught the virus.\n\n\"I think based on how many documented cases in cows there are, probably some decent human exposure is occurring,\" says Dr. Andrew Bowman, associate professor of veterinary preventive medicine at The Ohio State University. \"We just don't really know.\"\n\nThere have been 36 herds affected in nine states. Local and state health departments have tested about 25 people for the virus and monitored over 100 for symptoms, federal health officials said at a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThese people are in \"the footprints of where the bovine detections are,\" says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who's with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although he didn't provide details on the actual locations.\n\n\"There's a very low threshold for individuals to get tested,\" he adds.\n\nThe lack of testing early in the outbreak isn't necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when illnesses first cropped up in early March and it took time to identify the virus as the culprit.\n\nBut the total number of tests done on humans at this point seems low to Jessica Leibler, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"If the idea was to try to identify where there was spillover from these facilities to human populations, you'd want to try to test as many workers as possible,\" says Leibler, who has studied the risk of novel zoonotic influenza and animal agriculture.\n\nAlso, notes Gray, the virus is probably much more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases show, \"possibly spilling over much more to humans than we knew, or then we know.\"\n\nThe federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration released findings, showing that infectious virus wasn't present in about 200 samples collected from dairy products around the country. Initial results on ground meat are also reassuring.\n\nHowever, there still remain \"serious gaps\" in public health officials' ability to detect bird flu among those who work with cows, a task made all the more difficult by the fact that some cases may not be symptomatic, says Leibler. \"There's really widespread opportunity for worker exposure to this virus.\"\n\nOnly complicating matters -- the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains murky, although new federal testing requirements for moving cattle between states may help fill out the picture.\n\n\"Some of the dairy herds seem to have clinically normal animals, but potentially infected and [that] makes it really hard to know where to do surveillance,\" says Bowman.\n\nThe health care system would likely catch any alarming rise in human cases of bird flu, according to modeling done by the CDC.\n\nFederal health officials monitor influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. Hundreds of clinical laboratories that run tests are tasked with reporting findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for anyone with flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis who'd worked with livestock.\n\nBut even these safeguards may not be sufficient to get ahead of an outbreak.\n\n\"I worry that if we wait until we see a spike in those systems that perhaps we would already be seeing much more widespread community transmission,\" says Dr. Mary-Margaret Fill, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead she says there should be proactive testing.\n\nFill notes there are anecdotes about farmworkers with mild illness while working with cattle in some of the areas where the virus has spread and \"not enough visibility on the testing that's happening or not happening in those populations to understand what might be going on.\"\n\nTo get ahead of the virus, Leibler says not only do workers need to be screened but also their family members and others in the community, in the event that the virus does evolve to spread easily among humans.\n\nDr. Rodney Young says doctors in the Texas panhandle have been vigilant about any cases of influenza, particularly among those who are around livestock, but so far there are no indications of anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\"We just haven't seen people who fit that description in order to suddenly be testing a lot more,\" says Young,regional chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine in Amarillo.\n\nGray says it can be hard to detect and measure the illness in these rural workers for many reasons -- their remote location, a reluctance to seek out health care, a lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and a reticence among farmers \"to wave the flag\" that there are infections.\n\nThe farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus \"a huge priority,\" but right now they bear all the risks of going public, he says.\n\nDr. Fred Gingrich says this is a major barrier to closer cooperation between federal health officials and the industry during the current crisis.\n\nDairy cattle farmers currently don't get compensated for reporting infections in their herds -- unlike poultry farmers who receive indemnity payments for losses related to culling birds when they find cases, says Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners.\n\n\"So what is their incentive to report?\" he says, \"It's the same virus. It just doesn't kill our cows.\"\n\nGray has managed to start collecting samples from humans and cattle at several dairy farms that recently dealt with the virus. It's part of a study that he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover on farms.\n\nThey'll look for evidence of exposure to novel influenza, including bird flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.\n\nWhat concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm.\n\n\"We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,\" he says, \"The virus can just churn, make many copies of itself and the probability of spilling over to those workers is much greater.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's

The group published their findings yesterday on the preprint server bioRxiv.\n\nIn other H5N1 developments, the USDA last night announced that its tests on retail ground beef from affected states were negative, and two affected states -- Michigan and Colorado -- announced new emergency measures.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis using genome sequencing suggests that there was a reassortment event in late 2023 between the current highly pathogenic 2.3.4.4b clade in wild birds and a low-pathogenic wild bird strain, which produced the B3.13 genotype now circulating in dairy cows.\n\nThe NP gene acquired during reassortment may have played a role in the emergence in cattle, they wrote, noting that the NP gene seems to allow influenza viruses to spread more easily in pigs.\n\nTheir analysis suggests there were as many as five B3.13 introductions from cattle to poultry, one to a raccoon, two to domestic cats, and three to wild birds. Though the findings track with epidemiological findings of spread through movement of herds to other states, they emphasized that there are still gaps. \"We cannot exclude the possibility that this genotype is circulating in unsampled locations and hosts as the existing analysis suggests that data are missing and under surveillance may obscure transmission inferred using phylogenetic methods,\" they wrote.\n\nFor example, they said the B3.13 virus from the human infection doesn't nest within cattle sequences, which could suggest that viruses from unsampled cows were the source of the infection or that evolution within the host was enough to result in a different phylogenetic grouping. \"It is most likely, however, that asymptomatic transmission and undersurveillance in epidemiologically important populations drove this pattern.\"\n\nThey conclude that the potential for B3.13 to become endemic in cattle will influence the zoonotic risk from the virus and warned that if the low level of mammalian adaptations they're seeing become dominant, the risk of interspecies transmission will be higher.\n\nAfter the group published its report, Angela Rasmussen, PhD, a virologist with the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, on X (formerly known as Twitter), praised the group for sharing the critical data.\n\nHowever, she said more information is needed, such as the tissue and or sample type each genome came from, which is essential for understanding how cows are transmitting the virus and planning experiments to test transmission hypotheses. \"This is an all-hands situation and transparency & data access are required for an effective response,\" Rasmussen wrote.\n\nMichael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, publisher of CIDRAP News, also credited the USDA group for sharing their findings and said the science community has been anxiously waiting for the critical information.\n\n\"This will help people better understand how the spillover unfolded,\" he said.\n\nIn its update, the USDA said it tested 30 samples of retail ground beef from states where dairy herds tested positive for H5N1. The samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which can identify traces of the virus but not live virus, at the NVSL. All were negative.\n\n\"These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe,\" the agency said.\n\nThe USDA added that PCR testing is under way on muscle samples from culled dairy cows at selected USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) slaughter facilities and that its Agricultural Research Service is conducting a cooking study using a virus surrogate in ground beef to examine the impact of different cooking temperatures on virus levels.\n\nTwo states affected by H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds yesterday announced emergency measures aimed at controlling the spread of the virus.\n\nIn Michigan, where recent outbreaks in dairy cows and massive outbreaks in poultry were reported across seven counties, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) announced an extraordinary emergency measure that requires dairy farms and commercial poultry farms to implement biosecurity steps such as designating a biosecurity manager, establish cleaning procedures, and keeping a log book of vehicles and people who have crossed farm-access points.\n\nThe order also bars all lactating cattle from being displayed until the state has passed 60 days with no new dairy farm detections. Officials also announced a similar restriction for poultry, but for 30 days with no new detections.\n\nElsewhere, Colorado's agricultural commission approved, and the state's agriculture commissioner yesterday adopted, an emergency rule designed to limit the spread of H5N1. Colorado is the most recently affected state in the outbreak involving dairy cattle, and so far, it's not clear how the cows were exposed to the virus.", "source": {"uri": "cidrap.umn.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "CIDRAP"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phylogenetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassortment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reassortment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Infectious_Disease_Research_and_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whole genome sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rasmussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rasmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Saskatchewan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Saskatchewan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Osterholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_Research_Service", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural Research Service"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/layout_large/public/article/dairy%20cows%20in%20open%20barn.jpg?itok=vpGtlrpI", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

While some strains have caused serious disease and even death in humans, most cause relatively mild symptoms.\n\nIn the U.S., two people have been known to be infected with avian influenza: one person in 2022, and another earlier this year. In a report published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine -- amid growing concern over infections jumping from birds to cows -- health officials from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Texas Department of State Health Services provide details on the latest human case.\n\nAccording to the report, a dairy farm worker in Texas developed redness and some drainage from his right eye in late March. Because the Texas Animal Health Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture had reported at the end of March that bird flu viruses were detected in two Texas and two Kansas dairy farms, veterinarians in the area were alert for symptoms of infection in sick cows and in people. A vet referred the dairy worker for testing at a Texas Department of State Health Services field office, according to a spokesperson for the department. He did not develop any fever or difficulty breathing -- which are among the potential symptoms of infection -- and his vision remained normal. Dr. Scott Milton, a regional health director for the department, took swabs from the worker's eyes and back of his throat, and these were analyzed at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory in Lubbock, where preliminary results were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)A and A(H5).\n\nRead More: Is It Safe to Eat Eggs and Chicken During the Bird Flu Outbreak?\n\nHealth officials advised the man to isolate at home and prescribed the antiviral drug oseltamivir for five days to him as well as to members of his household to protect them from infection. So far, there have not been reports of sustained spread of avian influenza from person to person, but the antiviral medications were prescribed in an abundance of caution. The redness in his eyes resolved after several days, and the worker never developed any respiratory problems.\n\nAdditional analysis of the worker's samples by researchers at the CDC labs in Atlanta confirmed the specific type of avian influenza involved, HPAI 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1), which has recently been detected in bird and cattle populations. Such bird flu strains generally circulate among avian species, but there have been cases of human infections reported in 23 countries over the past 20 years, according to the new report. Overall, the virus has a 50% mortality rate -- but that could reflect a skewed population of people with more susceptible immune systems who are vulnerable to infection, since many cases lead to mild or no symptoms, or symptoms that aren't reported.\n\nThe strain in the dairy worker was \"closely related\" to those found in dairy cattle and birds in Texas during that time, according to the NEJM report. But the genetic analysis was a mixed bag of reassuring and concerning news. The strain that infected the dairy worker does have a change that helps it adapt to infecting mammals, including people. But it does not contain changes that would make it resistant to current antiviral treatments.

He noted that there have been \"clusters of influenza-like illnesses and conjunctivitis.\" documented and previous trend Involved Avian influenza strains like this one are deadly to poultry.\n\nFortunately, the virus' genetic sequence does not indicate that it has evolved to spread easily among humans.\n\nStill, epidemiologists say it's important to track potential infections. They are concerned that the infection could be passing undetected to some people, especially if the infection is mild and temporary. Texas dairy worker infected with virus.\n\n\"Given the number of cases in cattle that have been recorded, I think some level of human exposure is probably occurring,\" he says. Dr. Andrew Bowman, Associate Professor of Veterinary Preventive Medicine at The Ohio State University. \"We really don't know.\"\n\nThirty-six herds were affected in nine states. Federal health officials said in a briefing Wednesday that local and state health officials have tested about 25 people for the virus and are monitoring more than 100 people for symptoms.\n\nIt states that these people are \"in the footprints of where the cows were detected.\" Dr.Demetre Daskalakiswho is affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, declined to provide details about the actual location.\n\n\"The threshold for an individual to get tested is very low,\" he added.\n\nThe lack of testing early in the outbreak is not necessarily surprising. In places like Texas and Kansas, veterinarians weren't thinking about bird flu when it first appeared in early March, and it took some time to identify a virus as the cause.\n\nHowever, the total number of tests performed on humans to date appears to be small. jessica leibleran environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"If you're trying to determine where human transmission from these facilities is occurring, you want to test as many workers as possible,\" Leibler said. studied the risks New zoonotic influenza and livestock issues.\n\nGray also said the virus is probably far more geographically widespread in cattle than the reported cases indicate, and that it \"probably has the potential to spread to far more people than we know.\" \"There is,\" he points out.\n\nThe federal government has been quick to assess the safety of the dairy supply. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration announced findings showing no infectious virus was present in nearly 200 samples taken from dairy products across the country.Initial results on ground meat It's also safe.\n\nBut \"serious gaps\" remain in public health authorities' ability to detect avian influenza among cattle workers, a task made even more difficult by the fact that some cases do not show symptoms. says Leibler. \"The opportunities for workers to be exposed to this virus are very widespread.\"\n\nOnly complicating matters -- the true scale of the outbreak in cattle remains unclear despite new developments Federal exam requirements Because moving cattle interstate may help understand the situation.\n\n\"Some dairy herds have animals that appear clinically normal but are latently infected; [that] It's very difficult to know where to conduct surveillance,\" Bowman said.\n\nHealth systems are likely to cope with an alarming increase in human cases of avian influenza. According to modeling Conducted by CDC.\n\nFederal health officials are monitoring influenza activity in emergency departments and hospitals. The hundreds of clinical laboratories that perform the tests are tasked with reporting their findings. And in early April, a CDC health alert was sent to clinicians advising them to be on the lookout for people who worked with livestock and had flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis.\n\nHowever, these precautions may not be enough to prevent the spread of infection.\n\n\"I'm concerned that if we waited until we saw a surge in these systems, we would probably already have more widespread community transmission,\" he said. Dr. Mary Margaret Phil, Deputy State Epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of Health. Instead, she says aggressive testing should be used.\n\nFillnote has an anecdote about a farm worker who was tending to cattle in some areas where the virus is widespread and contracted a mild illness, adding, \"To understand what's going on... \"There is not enough visibility into whether testing is being done in these populations.\"\n\nLeibler said not only workers but also their families and community members need to be tested to stay ahead of the virus in case it evolves to spread easily among humans. It states that there is.\n\nDr. Rodney Young Doctors in Texas are wary of an outbreak of influenza, especially among people who are around livestock, but say there are no signs of anything unusual so far.\n\n\"All of a sudden we're doing more testing, and I've never seen anyone fit that description,\" said Young, regional director of the division of family and community medicine at the Texas Tech University Health Science Center School of Medicine in Amarillo. \" he says..\n\nGray said these rural workers are more likely to get sick for a number of reasons, including remoteness, reluctance to receive medical care, lack of health insurance, concerns about immigration status, and farmers' reluctance. states that it can be difficult to discover and measure. Wave the flag to let people know that an infectious disease exists.\n\nHe said the farms he works with consider protecting workers and curbing the spread of this virus to be a \"top priority,\" but at this point they are running all the risks of going public. he says.\n\nDr. Fred Gingrich This is a major barrier to close cooperation between federal health officials and industry during the current crisis, he said.\n\nDairy farmers currently do not receive compensation for reporting infections in their herds, said Gingrich, executive director of the American College of Bovine Practitioners. This is different from poultry farmers receiving compensation for losses associated with culling birds if they discover an infected person.\n\n\"So what's their motive for reporting?'' He said, \"It's the same virus, it's just not killing cows.\"\n\nMr Gray has successfully begun collecting samples from humans and cows at several dairy farms that have recently dealt with the virus. This is part of a study he launched before the H5N1 outbreak in response to concerns about SARS-CoV-2 spillover to farms.\n\nThey will be looking for evidence of exposure to new strains of influenza, including avian influenza, but he has a background in the field and has assured that the farm's anonymity will be maintained in the published paper. You can accomplish that.\n\nHis biggest concern is the possibility of outbreaks occurring on other types of farms.\n\n\"We know when the virus hits the poultry farm because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not develop severe symptoms,\" he says.

Inactive viral remnants have been found in grocery store milk. Tests also show the virus is spreading between cows, including those that don't show symptoms, and between cows and birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nStarting Monday, hundreds of thousands of lactating dairy cows in the U.S. will have to be tested -- with negative results -- before they can be moved between states, under terms of a new federal order.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the ongoing bird flu investigation:\n\nWHY IS THIS OUTBREAK SO UNUSUAL?\n\nThis strain of what's known as highly pathogenic avian influenza has been circulating in wild birds for decades. In recent years, it has been detected in scores of mammals around the world. Most have been wild animals, such as foxes and bears, that ate sick or dying birds. But it's also appeared in farmed minks. It's shown up in aquatic mammals, such as harbor seals and porpoises, too. The virus was even found in a polar bear in northern Alaska.\n\nThe virus was discovered in ruminants -- goats and then dairy cows -- in the U.S. this spring, surprising many scientists who have studied it for years.\n\n\"When we think of influenza A, cows are not typically in that conversation,\" said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nFlu viruses are notorious for adapting to spread among new species, so detection in dairy cows raises concerns it could spread to people, Webby said.\n\nHOW LONG HAS BIRD FLU BEEN SPREADING IN COWS?\n\nScientists confirmed the virus in cows in March after weeks of reports from dairy farms that the animals were falling ill. Symptoms included lethargy, sharply reduced milk supply and changes to the milk, which became thick and yellow.\n\nFinding remnants of the virus in milk on the market \"suggests that this has been going on longer, and is more widespread, than we have previously recognized,\" said Matthew Aliota, a veterinary medicine researcher at the University of Minnesota.\n\nUnder pressure from scientists, USDA officials released new genetic data about the outbreak this week.\n\nThe data omitted some information about when and where samples were collected, but showed that the virus likely was spread by birds to cattle late last year, said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist with the University of Arizona.\n\nSince then, it has spread among cattle and among farms, likely through contact with physical objects such as workers' shoes, trucks or milking machines, Worobey said.\n\nAnd then the cows spread the virus back to birds, he said.\n\n\"The genetic evidence is as clear as could be,\" Worobey said. \"Birds that are sampled on these farms have viruses with clear mammalian adaptations.\"\n\nWHAT DO SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT EFFORTS TO TRACK THE OUTBREAK?\n\nSeveral experts said the USDA's plans to require testing in cows are a good start.\n\n\"We need to be able to do greater surveillance so that we know what's going on,\" said Thomas Friedrich, a virology professor at the University of Wisconsin's veterinary school.\n\nWorobey said the ideal would be to screen every herd. Besides looking for active infections, agriculture officials also should be looking at whether cows have antibodies to the virus, indicating past infections, he said.\n\n\"That is a really accessible and quick way to find out how widespread this is,\" he said.\n\nMore testing of workers exposed to infected animals is also crucial, experts said. Some farm owners and some individual workers have been reluctant to work with public health officials during the outbreak, experts have said.\n\n\"Increased surveillance is essentially an early warning system,\" Aliota said. \"It helps to characterize the scope of the problem, but also to head off potentially adverse consequences.\"\n\nHOW BIG A RISK DOES BIRD FLU POSE FOR PEOPLE?\n\nScientists are working to analyze more samples of retail milk to confirm that pasteurization, or heat-treating, kills the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA's food safety center. Those results are expected soon.\n\nWhile the general public doesn't need to worry about drinking pasteurized milk, experts said they should avoid raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nAlso, dairy farm workers should consider extra precautions, such as masking, hand washing and changing work clothes, Aliota said.\n\nSo far, 23 people have been tested for the virus during the outbreak in dairy cows, with one person testing positive for a mild eye infection, CDC officials said. At least 44 people who were exposed to infected animals in the current outbreak are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nWHAT ARE SCIENTISTS' CONCERNS FOR THE FUTURE?\n\nDavid O'Connor, a virology expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, likened recent bird flu developments to a tornado watch versus a warning.\n\n\"There are some of the ingredients that would be necessary for there to be a threat, but we're not there,\" he said. As with a tornado watch, \"you wouldn't change anything about how you live your daily life, but you would maybe just have a bit of increased awareness that something is happening.\"\n\nWorobey said this is the kind of outbreak \"that we were hoping, after COVID, would not go unnoticed. But it has.\"\n\nHe said ambitious screening is needed \"to detect things like this very quickly, and potentially nip them in the bud.\"", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquatic mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor_seal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harbor seal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porpoise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polar bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://images3.naharnet.com/images/260855/w140.jpg?1714047883", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Tests have detected the virus among cattle in nine states, mainly in Texas and New Mexico, and most recently in Colorado, said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a May 1 event at the Council on Foreign Relations.A menagerie of other animals have been infected by H5N1, and at least one person in Texas. But what scientists fear most is if the virus were to spread efficiently from person to person. That hasn't happened and might not. Shah said the CDC considers the H5N1 outbreak \"a low risk to the general public at this time.\"Viruses evolve and outbreaks can shift quickly. \"As with any major outbreak, this is moving at the speed of a bullet train,\" Shah said. \"What we'll be talking about is a snapshot of that fast-moving train.\" What he means is that what's known about the H5N1 bird flu today will undoubtedly change.With that in mind, KFF Health News explains what you need to know now.Who gets bird flu?Mainly birds. Over the past few years, however, the H5N1 bird flu virus has increasingly jumped from birds into mammals around the world. The growing list of more than 50 species includes seals, goats, skunks, cats, and wild bush dogs at a zoo in the United Kingdom.

The situation is fraught with uncertainty as researchers' understanding of the virus evolves, along with the virus itself. On one point, however, the evidence is in: the U.S. needs better surveillance of pathogens on large livestock farms.\n\nAs of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported confirmed cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) in domestic livestock in nine states. The virus is \"highly pathogenic\" to birds, and to many other animals, including seals, but for now, CDC says the risk of infection to the general public \"remains low.\"\n\nEpidemiologists have long raised concerns that a \"bird flu\" variant may adapt to infect humans and cause another pandemic. When an H5N1 bird flu virus was first detected in 1996, it went on to infect nearly a thousand people with over a 50 percent death rate. In 2009, an avian influenza virus that jumped to pigs -- swine flu -- caused an estimated 12,469 deaths in the United States. The A(H5N1) virus has yet to result in a confirmed human death or serious illness. However, its lethality in wild life populations, and its widespread transmission between many species of mammals, including dairy cows, have raised concerns.\n\nExposure to infected dairy cows presumably caused the most recently confirmed case of human illness, reported by Texas officials on April 1. An earlier 2022 case, in Colorado, involved exposure to infected poultry. Both of those cases were reportedly mild. But influenza viruses are notorious for shapeshifting. The risk of A(H5N1) morphing into a pathogen that spreads easily between humans, with more serious health consequences, justifies a vigorous surveillance program to track where the virus is cropping up, how it is changing, and under what conditions it is spreading.\n\nUnfortunately, we are missing a critical component of that surveillance -- on the farm. Authorities with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have issued an order requiring mandatory testing of A(H5N1) in dairy cattle that cross state lines. But we need a broader sampling program. In addition to insights into all of the cows that stay in their home states, federal authorities should be pulling samples from other species, particularly pigs, which many experts see as a critical bridge between flu viruses that kill birds and people.\n\nUSDA has authority to require testing, at least for animal diseases. Federal statutes give the agency the power to \"carry out operations and measures to detect, control, or eradicate any pest or disease of livestock (including the drawing of blood and diagnostic testing of animals), including animals at a slaughterhouse, stockyard, or other point of concentration.\" 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8308. Concentrated hog and other concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), i.e. the source of the vast majority of all animal livestock and animal products consumed in the United States, presumably fall under \"other points of concentration.\" So USDA would seem to be on firm legal footing were it to implement an A(H5N1) testing requirement for hog farms. The law requires USDA to compensate farmers for testing costs, but if costs are preventing USDA from conducting critical surveillance to prevent the next pandemic, it should ask Congress for more money.\n\nThe pork industry may protest that A(H5N1) is not a disease that affects hogs, and that testing hogs for the virus would really amount to a public health surveillance program. To the extent this characterization is correct, it poses a problem, because the federal government lacks authority to require, or itself conduct, on-farm public health surveillance. Why are federal officials empowered to go on-farm to detect animal diseases, but not human diseases? Congress needs to address this absurd discrepancy.\n\nBird flu aside, public health officials' lack of authority to conduct basic epidemiological surveillance on farms affects food safety. Recent investigations in which the animal livestock industry refused to cooperate with federal requests for microbiological sampling include a Salmonella outbreak linked to pork, and an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infections linked to romaine lettuce suspected to be contaminated with manure from an adjacent feedlot that hosted over 100,000 cattle. Whole genome sequencing of samples from the hog and cattle operations implicated in these outbreaks, and countless others, may have yielded important clues about the outbreaks' origins, and how to avoid similar food safety breakdowns. But under the current oversight regime, livestock producers simply do not have an incentive to submit to sampling requests.\n\nFortunately, there are efforts underway to fix this problem. My organization, Consumer Federation of America, has joined other consumer advocates in supporting the Expanded Food Safety Investigation Act. The bill, now endorsed by 10 members of Congress across both houses, would give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to conduct microbiological sampling on CAFOs for the purposes of investigating a foodborne illness outbreak or any other public health need.\n\nSo far, the industry has not had to grapple seriously with requests to explain its opposition to seemingly common-sense measures like the Act. But as new pathogens like the A(H5N1) virus emerge, demand for reform will grow. Rather than reflexively obstructing efforts to increase transparency, livestock industry leaders should join in the conversation and help guide the development of effective pathogen surveillance protocols on-farm.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers can protect themselves from the A(H5N1) virus in food by avoiding raw milk, and practicing the \"four core\" food safety handling practices for meat and poultry, including eggs. For workers, CDC has issued guidelines on the use of PPE.\n\nWith luck, the A(H5N1) virus will remain innocuous to humans and soon leave the public eye. However, we should not wait for a crisis to begin establishing critical public health infrastructure. That infrastructure includes policies to effectively conduct on-farm surveillance of human illness causing pathogens.", "source": {"uri": "foodsafetynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Food Safety News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_animal_feeding_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concentrated animal feeding operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swine influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/055/100/834/JWBKNELpyQ2r3mG3QPvbX5R93/e4b8e1f751986bd0aebb78a94909b79ed52e02a7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 1573, "textEnd": 1580}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Here's why", "body": "The director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dugan is leading the team of CDC scientists that is working with partners -- in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and state and local health departments -- to respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle.\n\nThe response has been pedal to the metal since the USDA announced on March 25 that a strange illness that had been affecting milk production in some herds since early this year was caused by bird flu. Since then, 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus.\n\nAssessing the risk from the situation and messaging it to the public is a balancing act, she admitted. While workers on affected dairy farms are being exposed to the virus -- one has tested positive so far -- for the individual American elsewhere, the risk is low, for the moment. Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases -- in which the flu division is housed -- said Wednesday that 25 people have been tested for H5N1 in the context of this outbreak, and over 100 people have been monitored for symptoms because they were believed to have been exposed.\n\nThe responding agencies have long experience working with poultry farmers, who've been plagued by this virus for the past couple of years. But its move into cattle has been like crossing into a new country for the agencies. Dairy farmers have no experience with bird flu. Many farmers and farm workers haven't been eager to cooperate with authorities.\n\nIn an ideal world, blood samples from people who had contact with the infected farm worker would have been studied to look for H5N1 antibodies to see if he transmitted the virus to anyone, a technique called a serology study. But Dugan said she believes that the people involved wouldn't grant permission.\n\nSTAT asked Dugan about the work the CDC is doing, the complaints from scientists globally about the amount of information the United States has been sharing, and where the needle on her H5N1 risk meter sits right now. As we spoke, a colorful statue of a rooster was visible on a credenza behind her -- apt decor for a flu researcher.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe numbers of people tested and/or monitored seems to be implausibly low, given the numbers of workers who would have been exposed to the infected animals. How hard is the U.S. looking for cases?\n\nWe had a team pretty much ready to go six weeks ago, when this first really started to show up on our radar. But this is not the average poultry-worker response situation. These are dairy farms. The poultry space and poultry industry, they've been responding to H5 for the past 2 \u00bd years, really. There've been more than 8,000 people that have been monitored for symptoms in the H5 poultry space. It's a different environment altogether when we're talking about dairy cattle and dairy farms.\n\nThat said, we are really thinking about how we would go about doing the investigation we would normally do for a novel flu case -- where they're all nationally notifiable infections in people -- in a way that makes scientific and epidemiological sense.\n\nThe states are really focusing on that, really trying to get as much information as they can. So it's really more in that local space. We're supporting them in that effort. Some states have been able to contact workers directly and actively monitor. Others, of course, have not been as successful.\n\nSo it's a work in progress. We have a couple of potential locations that we're trying to do more with in getting the logistics sorted out. But no studies have been completed yet.\n\nNo studies have been completed yet. Have any studies started?\n\nThat's probably a good question for some of the impacted states. We don't want to get ahead of them for any work they may be doing that we don't have all the details on.\n\nIt sounds like your team that was ready to go didn't go. And it sounds like from what you're telling me that CDC is very much in the back seat on this one. That it's the states or local authorities who are running this.\n\nThey have the authority, right? CDC does not have the authority to go into a state. We have to have an invite from state public health.\n\nHave any states invited CDC in?\n\nNo. Not officially yet. We're speaking to these partners if not once a day, more than that.\n\nThere are a lot of sensitivities. There are a lot of things that we as public health officials may not be aware of in thinking about dairy farms. We're used to working with poultry farms and poultry workers where they're culling all the birds. These cows are not being culled. So it's a very different space.\n\nWe're working very closely with the state public health partners, where potentially they might be a lead of a study. And we would be in the background supporting. Sometimes we don't need to deploy a team, we can equip our state public health partners to do the information gathering and work collaboratively with them to do that.\n\nThere has been a single human case in Texas. Has anybody done serology testing around that individual? That would be an obvious place to start, would it not?\n\nI don't know that that was consented to. You have to have consent from people to follow up. Certainly it was something that was on our radar for what we would like to have and request, but to my knowledge, serology was not performed.\n\nThe scientific world has been watching H5 for a long time. CDC has been very involved in that. And whenever there have been unusual outbreaks, this country has always pushed for rapid case finding and data sharing.\n\nI'm hearing from people outside the United States that when the shoe is on the other foot, when the outbreak is here, they're not seeing the information sharing that they would hope for, or even evidence that the work that is crucial to finding out whether or not this could get seeded into the human population is happening. Do you have any response to that?\n\nIt's a complicated situation as far as [there are] new partners and new individuals and a different group of farm workers. We're doing everything we can and thinking about messaging, multilingual messages, communications, PPE [personal protective equipment], biosecurity on farms, and collaboration with USDA to really protect workers. That is definitely one of our highest priorities, and it always is.\n\nBut also we're really thinking about this in the medium and longer term of what allowing a virus to circulate within a new mammalian host could mean. I don't think anybody really can predict what might happen, but we certainly know flu viruses change. And we do not want to give the virus that opportunity, if we can avoid it.\n\nBy the way, I think you need to add to your statue collection. The chicken needs a cow.\n\nYeah.\n\nOn data sharing, we are trying to be as forthcoming and as transparent as we can with the data that we have. I think we're doing that in the \"Spotlights\" that we're putting out every Friday. We got the Texas human virus sequence out as quickly as we could.\n\nSo I think we're trying to do that as much as we can. We can always do more. But a lot of this, again, is our partnerships with the states. We defer to them. We have to be behind the scenes and let them talk about what's going on in their state.\n\nCan I ask about your personal read on the risk here? If this virus gets seeded into the cow population and it evolves in cows, what do you think this does to the human risk from H5N1?\n\n[Dugan grimaced.] I think it would definitely impact the risk, for sure. Our current assessment of the risk to the general public health is low. That could change. And so I think we're remaining very vigilant -- if anything, more vigilant in this space.\n\nThese viruses change. If this were to become seeded in cows and become a cow-endemic virus, it certainly would increase that risk to people.\n\nAnd certainly our pandemic planning [operation] has been really thinking about this and trying to be as vigilant as we can now, to try and understand not just current risk, but the future risk so that we're as prepared as we can be.\n\nBut the risk could be quite big.\n\nYou said you still think the risk is low. But 15 years ago this spring, CDC was notified about two kids from California who had tested positive for swine flu who hadn't had exposure to pigs or each other. Before April 17, 2009, the risk of a swine flu pandemic would have seemed pretty low. And then CDC got those two samples, and everything changed really fast. Do you think about that?\n\nWell, yeah. It's probably why I'm not sleeping very much right now.\n\nI think that the threat of a pandemic is always looming in the flu space. The way that Dan Jernigan [Dugan's predecessor] always described public health to me is that it is an art form. There's a balance that you have to strike. There's a difference in the pandemic risk versus the immediate risk right now. And so I think that's what we're trying to message to the average person who is walking about and living their lives. The risk to them is low.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_branswell@statnews.com", "name": "Helen Branswell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stat (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Immunization_and_Respiratory_Diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/53290576146_09023cbb07_3k-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 410, "textEnd": 418}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-04-17", "textStart": 8427, "textEnd": 8441}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Scientists believe the virus might be passing from cow to cow, not relying on transmission from infected birds. There are reports of cats on farms getting infected after drinking the cows' milk, and one case of a human in the US contracting the disease after contact with cattle.\n\nDr Richard Webby is an infectious diseases researcher at Saint Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Influenza Studies. He told RNZ's Sunday Morning the virus' sudden jump into cows and its fast spread took experts by surprise.\n\n\"It's almost like the Crusaders losing five in a row. Had you asked me six weeks ago what the chance [was] of finding this virus in cows, I would have said none. So it's a completely new event for us.\n\n\"We think we know this virus, and then something happens next week that teaches us that we didn't really know anything about it.\"\n\nThere have been hundreds of human H5N1 cases reported since the virus was discovered in the late 1990s - about half of those fatal, making it potentially far deadlier than COVID-19, even before we had vaccines.\n\nA recent international survey of senior disease experts revealed 57 percent think a strain of flu will be the cause of the next global outbreak of deadly infectious illness.\n\n\"Influenza is always at the top of the list,\" Webby said. \"We don't need to know exactly what the next agent is going to be, but you know, preparing for one may very well give us a leg up [in] preparing for the other.\"\n\nWhile humans can be infected with H5N1, there is only limited evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"It still would rather be inside a bird replicating than anywhere else,\" Webby said. \"But any time it does get into a mammal, that at least theoretically gives that virus a little bit more opportunity to change and perhaps be a little bit more mammal, like a little bit more able to infect mammals, including humans.\n\n\"So, from that perspective, any time we see it in a mammal it's of concern, but we're now going into this a little bit blind, to be honest with you - we don't know what is likely going to happen here. We don't know what the virus is going to do in terms of changing.\"\n\nIf it started infecting pigs, that would be cause for greater concern.\n\n\"They have their own flus. A lot of them are actually viruses that we humans have given them and they've managed to be maintained.\n\n\"But when we look at what we do know about the different hosts, we do know that when these avian viruses, if they get into pigs, then growth in the pig can actually make those viruses more infectious for humans. So, yeah, that's why we absolutely don't want this virus in that host.\"\n\nIt it unlikely we will get any advance warning from scientists if it did start spreading between people, he warned.\n\n\"If all of a sudden the virologic stars align and what's a bird virus in a cow one day suddenly gets all of the mutations it needs to be a human virus, then the chances of us picking that up in advance are pretty slim. We're going to find that when we start to see accumulation of human cases.\"\n\nAs for New Zealand's sizeable dairy industry, Webb said the risk - for now - was low.\n\n\"I think if I was a cow in New Zealand, to be honest, I'd be feeling pretty safe from this virus. If I was a chicken, maybe I'd be feeling a little less safe. But what I mean by that is this episode in cows, this is the first time we've even seen it over the 25-odd years that we've been tracing.\n\n\"The great, great, great, great, great granddaddy and grandmothers of this virus started in Southeast Asia back in the late 1990s. We haven't seen it in cows before. So, even though this virus has been there for that long, it's transitioned to cows, it's been pretty rare.\n\n\"So, put yourself in a New Zealand situation. If you're a cow in New Zealand, it's not just the fact that this virus doesn't seem to get into cows very much, but you don't even have the virus there yet. So it's a pretty safe place to be.\"\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries and Department of Conservation have been preparing a contingency plan for an inevitable \"tsunami\" of bird flu coming to New Zealand. It has already been found in Antarctica.\n\nThere are some migrating birds that visit New Zealand.\n\n\"Just because New Zealand doesn't have it yet, I don't think, I wouldn't say that's going to be a true statement forever. But the chance of it, one, getting into New Zealand and then two, getting into a New Zealand cow, I think that the chances are pretty slim.\"\n\nComing so soon after the world-changing COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest of its kind in a century, Webby feared the public would not take the threat seriously. SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind COVID-19 - made the leap to humans from an animal host sometime in late 2019, scientists believe.\n\n\"This is a bad time for this to be happening - 'It's those scientists again, they're going to worry us about a virus that's going to come and kill us all tomorrow:'...People don't want to hear about this.\n\n\"They don't want to hear about being vaccinated against a new virus again. So yeah, [the] timing is not good, for sure.\"\n\nIf an outbreak in humans did happen, Webby also feared officials - despite lessons learned from COVID-19 - would not be ready.\n\n\"It may not be this virus, but something is absolutely going to do that. It's going to jump from an animal into humans and we're going to be COVID pandemic all over again, or it could be COVID pandemic sort of supercharged as well.\n\n\"There's clearly not enough resources going into this preparedness of pandemics, and that's not a New Zealand-centric issue, it's not a US-centric issue, it's a global issue. You know, it's almost like we're not willing to sort of put those resources into the insurance we really need.\"\n\nRNZ", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crusades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2024/05/timing-is-not-good-for-h5n1-bird-flu-pandemic-new-zealand-researcher-warns-amid-united-states-outbreak/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1714884946100/Bird_flu_CREDIT_Reuters_160223_1120.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The study's authors suggest that the spread in cattle started from a single spillover event from birds in the Texas panhandle that may have happened in early December. The USDA didn't confirm the presence of H5N1 in a Texas herd until March 25.\n\n\"These data support a single introduction event from wild bird origin virus into cattle, likely followed by limited local circulation for approximately 4 months prior to confirmation by USDA,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe findings add more precision to what had previously been reported by academic scientists. Reading viral genomes can provide clues to the origins of the outbreak and allows researchers to monitor how the virus, which primarily infects wild and farmed birds, is changing as it finds a foothold in bovine hosts.\n\nIn an initial analysis of USDA genome sequence data released last week, academic DNA sleuths had revealed that the outbreak in dairy cows has likely been going on for months longer than previously realized, and has probably spread more widely than official numbers would suggest. So far, the USDA has reported 36 herds in nine states have tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe new analysis also offers a window into how the bird flu is changing as it spends time in the bodies of cattle.\n\nIn the last few years, H5N1 has spread from wild birds to a variety of carnivorous mammals, including foxes, bears, and seals, but in each of those instances, the virus has hit a dead end. The outbreak in dairy cows represents one of the first times that this bird flu virus has demonstrated the ability to efficiently transmit between mammals, said Thomas Mettenleiter, a virologist who served as the director of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut -- Germany's leading animal disease research center -- from 1996 until he stepped down last year. The other instance was a number of outbreaks at mink farms in Spain and Finland in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n\"These spillover events don't usually lead to transmission chains,\" he said. \"This situation is definitely an eye-opener for me.\"\n\nThe USDA's analysis found about two dozen mutations that have arisen in the H5N1 virus as it has circulated in dairy cattle that are known to make influenza viruses more deadly or more likely to be able to infect humans.\n\n\"It's still really difficult to draw a risk map out of that, but there seems to be ongoing evolution,\" Mettenleiter said. \"This is not surprising but it's good to know. All these mammal-to-mammal passages, as we would do experimentally, put an evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate and this is what we see with the increase of these known mammalian adaptation markers.\"\n\nVivien Dugan, director of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told STAT Thursday that the mutations found so far did not raise any immediate red flags for increased risk to human health.\n\n\"I think based on our analysis of the consensus and some of that raw [sequence] data -- because we have a good data-sharing relationship with USDA -- we've not seen anything that would be concerning to us for mammalian adaptation, at this point,\" Dugan said.\n\nThe CDC has been testing existing H5 vaccines in ferrets, and found that vaccination appears to offer cross-protection against the virus from the man who was infected in Texas.\n\nScientists who have been frustrated by the slow drip of data from the USDA's investigations hailed the preprint on social media as progress. \"Really grateful to this research team for sharing this, though I hope they weren't holding on to the data solely to ensure they published first,\" Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who studies pathogens that jump from animals to people at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada -- posted on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nFor weeks, the agency has been facing criticism from scientists and pandemic experts for a lack of transparency and timely sharing of data about the outbreak that has slowed down efforts to track its progress. When the USDA finally uploaded a large tranche of genetic sequences of the pathogen to a public database, researchers eager to analyze the sequences to determine if the H5N1 virus has been changing as it is transmitted from cow to cow quickly discovered that the sequences didn't include necessary information about when and where the samples were collected. All are simply labeled with \"USA\" and \"2024.\"\n\nThe USDA has denied taking that basic information -- called metadata -- off the sequence files. The agency's Animal and Plant Health Inspection service has said it is sharing raw sequence data as quickly as it is available and plans to upload \"consensus sequences\", which are more thoroughly edited and contain the metadata scientists are seeking, when they are ready.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_molteni@statnews.com",

But does the virus pose any threat to humans?\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza is an infectious viral illness that spreads primarily among wild and domestic birds. But the virus that causes bird flu can sometimes jump into animals, including dairy cows and, in some cases, humans.\n\n\"Bird flu, or avian influenza, infects more than 100 species of wild birds, especially migratory waterfowl,\" Carl Abraham, an assistant professor of medicine at the New York Institute of Technology, told Newsweek. \"In birds, it is highly contagious [and] causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.\n\n\"Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza [which is the form of the disease causing the current outbreak] has the ability to spread beyond the airways and lungs to infect multiple organs often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\"\n\nOver the last decade, bird flu cases in mammals have been on the rise.\n\n\"In most cases, mammal infection is thought to occur after the animal eats an infected bird,\" Abraham said.\n\n\"In 2024, the first reports of avian influenza (H5N1 strain) infected U.S. domesticated cattle that is possibly being transmitted cow-to-cow. This is now a multistate outbreak although the numbers of cattle infected in each state is small and the illness marked by transient reductions in milk production.\"\n\nDespite the relatively small number of infected cows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified genetic traces of the virus in 1 in 5 commercial milk samples tested. The virus fragments are not actually capable of causing an infection -- the process of pasteurization has seen to that -- but the findings raise concerns about the risks associated with unpasteurized \"raw milks.\"\n\nIn a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers warned that such unpasteurized milk posed a significant for potential cross-species infections. In particular, the study focused on the risks to domestic cats, who have developed fatal infections after drinking unpasteurized milk from affected cows.\n\n\"Our findings support those of previous work that has shown domestic cats can be highly susceptible to HPAI A (H5N1) virus,\" the study's first author, Eric Burrough, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, told Newsweek. \"Cats that have outdoor access should be monitored to avoid potential exposure to and consumption of dead wild birds.\"\n\n\"It is rare for avian influenza to infect humans,\" Abraham said. \"Two cases have been reported in the U.S., both in persons with significant exposure to infected mammals -- most recently this year in a cattle worker in Texas who had conjunctivitis [pink eye] as the only symptom. Therefore, the risk of illness to humans is extremely low.\n\n\"Persons who own birds that come into contact with wild birds and cattle farmers are at most risk to come into contact with bird flu, but the risk of illness in those persons is still negligible.\"\n\nHowever, as we saw in 2020, viruses can evolve fast.\n\n\"Influenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species,\" Abraham said. \"This frequently causes the genes of different strains within a single host to mix, commonly referred to as recombination events.\n\n\"Most recombination events result in influenza viruses that are not able to replicate or replicate less efficiently. However, rare recombination events may increase illness severity, increase transmission, or even, as we are seeing with cattle this year, infection of new species. It is possible for a recombination event to give avian influenza the ability to infect humans.\n\n\"If the same virus caused human-to-human transmission, it could have pandemic potential. Again, this would be a rare event, but it is possible.\"\n\nWhile no significant threat has been identified for humans, Abraham added that studying viral transmission patterns like this could help predict and prevent future pandemics.\n\n\"The new information gained as we study viral outbreaks helps us to prepare for the next pandemic [not an \"if,\" but a \"when\" scenario],\" he said. \"Responses to outbreaks based on scientific evidence are most likely to result in the best public health outcome. What we learn today may save us tomorrow. That which we ignore puts as at risk.

The information is critical as flu experts fear the outbreak is heightening the ever-present risk that this wily flu virus will evolve to spread among humans and spark a pandemic.\n\nBut, the information hasn't been easy to come by. Since March 25 -- when the USDA confirmed for the first time that a herd of US dairy cows had contracted the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus -- the agency has garnered international criticism for not sharing data quickly or completely. On April 21, the agency dumped over 200 genetic sequences into public databases amid pressure from outside experts. However, many of those sequences lack descriptive metadata, which normally contains basic and key bits of information, like when and where the viral sample was taken. Outside experts don't have that crucial information, making independent analyses frustratingly limited. Thus, the new USDA analysis -- which presumably includes that data -- offers the best yet glimpse of the complete information on the outbreak.\n\nUndetected spread\n\nOne of the big takeaways is that USDA researchers think the spillover of bird flu from wild birds to cattle began late last year, likely in December. Thus, the virus likely circulated undetected in dairy cows for around four months before the USDA's March 25 confirmation of an infection in a Texas herd.\n\nThis timeline conclusion largely aligns with what outside experts previously gleaned from the limited publicly available data. So, it may not surprise those following the outbreak, but it is worrisome. Months of undetected spread raise significant concerns about the country's ability to identify and swiftly respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks -- and whether public health responses have moved past the missteps seen in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut another big finding from the preprint is how many gaps still exist in our current understanding of the outbreak. To date, the USDA has identified 36 herds in nine states that have been infected with H5N1. The good news from the genetic analysis is that the USDA can draw lines connecting most of them. USDA researchers reported that \"direct movement of cattle based upon production practices\" seems to explain how H5N1 hopped from the Texas panhandle region -- where the initial spillover is thought to have occurred -- to nine other states, some as far-flung as North Carolina, Michigan, and Idaho.\n\nPutative transmission pathways of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13 supported by epidemiological links, animal movements, and genomic analysis. [/ars_img]The bad news is that those lines connecting the herds aren't solid. There are gaps in which the genetic data suggests unidentified transmission occurred, maybe in unsampled cows, maybe in other animals entirely. The genetic data is clear that once this strain of bird flu -- H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4 genotype B3.13 -- hopped into cattle, it could readily spread to other mammals. The genetic data links viruses from cattle moving many times into other animals: There were five cattle-to-poultry jumps, one cattle-to-raccoon transmission, two events where the virus moved from cattle to domestic cats, and three times when the virus from cattle spilled back into wild birds.\n\n\"We cannot exclude the possibility that this genotype is circulating in unsampled locations and hosts as the existing analysis suggests that data are missing and undersurveillance may obscure transmission inferred using phylogenetic methods,\" the USDA researchers wrote in their preprint.",

Scientists believe the virus might be passing from cow to cow, not relying on transmission from infected birds. There are reports of cats on farms getting infected after drinking the cows' milk, and one case of a human in the US contracting the disease after contact with cattle.\n\nDr Richard Webby is an infectious diseases researcher at Saint Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, and the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Influenza Studies. He told RNZ's Sunday Morning the virus' sudden jump into cows and its fast spread took experts by surprise.\n\n\"It's almost like the Crusaders losing five in a row. Had you asked me six weeks ago what the chance [was] of finding this virus in cows, I would have said none. So it's a completely new event for us.\n\n\"We think we know this virus, and then something happens next week that teaches us that we didn't really know anything about it.\"\n\nThere have been hundreds of human H5N1 cases reported since the virus was discovered in the late 1990s - about half of those fatal, making it potentially far deadlier than Covid-19, even before we had vaccines.\n\nA recent international survey of senior disease experts revealed 57 percent think a strain of flu will be the cause of the next global outbreak of deadly infectious illness.\n\n\"Influenza is always at the top of the list,\" Webby said. \"We don't need to know exactly what the next agent is going to be, but you know, preparing for one may very well give us a leg up [in] preparing for the other.\"\n\nWhile humans can be infected with H5N1, there is only limited evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"It still would rather be inside a bird replicating than anywhere else,\" Webby said. \"But any time it does get into a mammal, that at least theoretically gives that virus a little bit more opportunity to change and perhaps be a little bit more mammal, like a little bit more able to infect mammals, including humans.\n\n\"So, from that perspective, any time we see it in a mammal it's of concern, but we're now going into this a little bit blind, to be honest with you - we don't know what is likely going to happen here. We don't know what the virus is going to do in terms of changing.\"\n\nIf it started infecting pigs, that would be cause for greater concern.\n\n\"They have their own flus. A lot of them are actually viruses that we humans have given them and they've managed to be maintained.\n\n\"But when we look at what we do know about the different hosts, we do know that when these avian viruses, if they get into pigs, then growth in the pig can actually make those viruses more infectious for humans. So, yeah, that's why we absolutely don't want this virus in that host.\"\n\nIt it unlikely we will get any advance warning from scientists if it did start spreading between people, he warned.\n\n\"If all of a sudden the virologic stars align and what's a bird virus in a cow one day suddenly gets all of the mutations it needs to be a human virus, then the chances of us picking that up in advance are pretty slim. We're going to find that when we start to see accumulation of human cases.\"\n\nAs for New Zealand's sizeable dairy industry, Webb said the risk - for now - was low.\n\n\"I think if I was a cow in New Zealand, to be honest, I'd be feeling pretty safe from this virus. If I was a chicken, maybe I'd be feeling a little less safe. But what I mean by that is this episode in cows, this is the first time we've even seen it over the 25-odd years that we've been tracing.\n\n\"The great, great, great, great, great granddaddy and grandmothers of this virus started in Southeast Asia back in the late 1990s. We haven't seen it in cows before. So, even though this virus has been there for that long, it's transitioned to cows, it's been pretty rare.\n\n\"So, put yourself in a New Zealand situation. If you're a cow in New Zealand, it's not just the fact that this virus doesn't seem to get into cows very much, but you don't even have the virus there yet. So it's a pretty safe place to be.\"\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries and Department of Conservation have been preparing a contingency plan for an inevitable \"tsunami\" of bird flu coming to New Zealand. It has already been found in Antarctica.\n\nThere are some migrating birds that visit New Zealand.\n\n\"Just because New Zealand doesn't have it yet, I don't think, I wouldn't say that's going to be a true statement forever. But the chance of it, one, getting into New Zealand and then two, getting into a New Zealand cow, I think that the chances are pretty slim.\"\n\nComing so soon after the world-changing Covid-19 pandemic, the biggest of its kind in a century, Webby feared the public would not take the threat seriously. SARS-CoV-2 - the virus behind Covid-19 - made the leap to humans from an animal host sometime in late 2019, scientists believe.\n\n\"This is a bad time for this to be happening - 'It's those scientists again, they're going to worry us about a virus that's going to come and kill us all tomorrow:'...People don't want to hear about this.\n\n\"They don't want to hear about being vaccinated against a new virus again. So yeah, [the] timing is not good, for sure.\"\n\nIf an outbreak in humans did happen, Webby also feared officials - despite lessons learned from Covid-19 - would not be ready.\n\n\"It may not be this virus, but something is absolutely going to do that. It's going to jump from an animal into humans and we're going to be Covid pandemic all over again, or it could be Covid pandemic sort of supercharged as well.\n\n\"There's clearly not enough resources going into this preparedness of pandemics, and that's not a New Zealand-centric issue, it's not a US-centric issue, it's a global issue. You know, it's almost like we're not willing to sort of put those resources into the insurance we really need.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crusades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s---bUJySt5--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1643843216/4M52MCH_image_crop_129203", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

And how bad would it be? | CBC News", "body": "This story is part of CBC Health's Second Opinion, a weekly analysis of health and medical science news emailed to subscribers on Saturday mornings. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.\n\nAs early as 1997, just a year after H5N1 was first discovered, there were warning signs this form of avian flu was capable of wreaking havoc far beyond birds.\n\nThat year, poultry outbreaks in China and Hong Kong were linked to 18 human infections -- and a third of those people later died.\n\nIn the decades that followed, alarm bells from the scientific community rang louder and louder. H5N1 began infecting dozens more species, from tens of millions of wild and farmed birds, to raccoons and foxes, to seals and sea lions to, most recently, U.S. dairy cattle. The virus eventually caused more than 800 human infections around the world with a stunning death rate -- for known cases -- of roughly 50 per cent.\n\n\"The increasing host range of the virus, [its] potential spread among mammals and between a mammal and a human, its wide geographical spread, and the unprecedented scale of the outbreaks in birds, raise concerns about the pandemic potential\" of H5N1, warned a May editorial in leading medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n\nGiven those factors, an avian flu pandemic may feel not just inevitable, but imminent.\n\nYet the reality is murkier. Though influenza viruses have a knack for rapid evolution, this one hasn't managed to adapt to sustain human-to-human transmission, despite circulating for the last three decades.\n\n\"But that could still potentially happen,\" said epidemiologist Timothy Sly, a longtime influenza researcher and professor emeritus with Toronto Metropolitan University's school of public health.\n\n\"And if it ever did happen... it would be a global health catastrophe.\"\n\nSo how likely is that kind of worst-case scenario? And if H5N1 does start spreading person to person -- in a month, or a year, or a decade -- what would its impacts really be?\n\nCBC News talked to several researchers, including those studying H5N1 now and others who've followed influenza trends for decades, to help unpack the crucial unanswered questions around this virus's capacity for sparking a possible pandemic.\n\n\"Are we watching the beginning? Is this where we're seeing repeated spillovers that one day take off? Or is it like in COVID, where suddenly there's a cluster of human cases and then it's too late?\" questioned Louise Moncla, an avian flu researcher and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThere's no way to know, she says.\n\nThat's why scientists like Moncla are watching the virus closely to understand its transmission patterns and ongoing evolution, all to spot early signals that a storm may be brewing.\n\nThe spread of H5N1 among U.S. dairy cattle in recent months, and data trickling out from the department of agriculture, offered a treasure trove of genetic sequencing for scientists to sort through.\n\nSeveral research teams, Moncla's included, recently reached similar conclusions: The virus likely spilled from birds into cows as far back as late 2023, and spread undetected among cattle for months before the first cases were reported this March.\n\nMoncla's ongoing analysis of the sequences released to date also outlines how the currently circulating form of H5N1 -- a lineage known as 2.3.4.4b -- features some concerning mutations.\n\n\"There's no smoking guns,\" she quickly said. \"There are some mutations that have occurred that may enhance replication in mammals, but some of the mutations that we would be really worried about, we're not seeing.\"\n\nThose include adaptations that would allow this virus to better bind to human-specific receptors in the upper airway, which would give it the ability to transmit easily between people. Without that kind of notable shift, H5N1 infections in humans usually end up hitting dead ends.\n\nTake the recent instance of a worker infected in Texas. An overview of the case, published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, outlined how the worker was in close contact with sick dairy cattle, and developed eye inflammation and broken blood vessels as a result. The virus identified in the worker's specimen also had a previously seen genetic change that's associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts.\n\nBut the individual didn't develop any respiratory symptoms -- nor did any household contacts fall ill.\n\nSo what would it take for onward transmission to occur? Very little, evolutionarily speaking.\n\n\"Influenza is a virus that does mutate fairly easily,\" said Dr. Jennifer Guthrie, an associate professor with Western University in London, Ont., who specializes in pathogen genomics and infectious diseases.\n\n\"The longer things circulate, there is always the possibility the situation could change.\"\n\nDespite those concerns, what's particularly muddy right now is how a rising number of cattle infections are impacting farm workers, beyond the Texas case that occurred back in March.\n\nVeterinarians and physicians in states with dairy cattle outbreaks told The Associated Press there are multiple reports of farm workers falling sick, but confirming cases is proving challenging for one key reason: Many workers are reluctant to get tested.\n\n\"You have groups of individuals that don't have close contact with health care for various reasons,\" said Guthrie. \"Maybe they're vulnerable populations like migrants, or language is a barrier.\"\n\nState health labs have also sent around 25 human test samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so far, and another 100 or so workers are being monitored.\n\nThe risk of going from a few sporadic cases to \"something of international concern\" is \"not insignificant,\" CDC principal deputy director Nirav Shah said Wednesday, Politico reported.\n\n\"We've all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on. That's a risk and one that we have to be mindful of.\"\n\nMoncla also says the risks are real, but questions whether government data is being shared fast enough -- and fully enough -- to help scientists unpack what's at stake. It's not clear exactly how many people will be tested going forward, or how proactive officials are being to find potential new cases or clusters, she warns.\n\nThe full tally and severity of human infections could provide added insight, revealing whether there are high numbers of infected people with mild or no symptoms, or if there's still a major evolutionary barrier -- like scientists hope -- that's keeping this virus from striking humans on a regular basis.\n\nThere are also burning questions, Moncla says, about how exposure pathways play a role.\n\nHow different are these infections when someone, say, inhales large amounts of virus while slaughtering an infected chicken, compared to someone who gets sick after milking a cow? And what are the links to symptoms, from mild eye inflammation all the way to deadly respiratory illness?\n\n\"Filling in that missing gap is pretty important,\" Moncla said.\n\nSly, in Toronto, also stresses the need to understand H5N1's potential impacts, should it ever begin spreading person to person. In particular, determining its true death rate is a question the epidemiologist has been trying to answer since the early 2000s.\n\nBy that point, the World Health Organization had estimated that the case fatality rate for avian flu in humans was roughly 60 per cent. If such a death rate were to be sustained in a pandemic, Sly and other scientists wrote in a 2008 paper, H5N1 would represent a \"truly dreadful scenario.\"\n\nBut the team's own analysis of surveillance data, along with blood test studies to determine prior exposure to the virus, concluded the virus's case fatality rate in humans was likely closer to 14 to 33 per cent.\n\nFar more human infections have been reported since then, including those that may be flying under the radar, suggesting the true death rate could be even lower still.\n\n\"Globally at least, we're probably not catching many cases, so the denominator is, I suspect, an underestimate to some degree,\" said Guthrie. \"Someone having something really, really mild probably wouldn't even know they have influenza.\"\n\nEven so, Sly warns the impact of a new flu virus sweeping through the population would grind society to a halt, causing high levels of death and illness.\n\nThe case fatality rates of prior influenza pandemics have ranged from less than one per cent, during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, to an estimated 2.5 per cent in 1918, which studies suggest may have killed anywhere from 23 to 50 million people around the world in just a few years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a coronavirus rather than influenza, had a case fatality rate of up to 8.5 per cent in early 2020, according to one analysis, which later dropped to 0.27 per cent by late 2022.\n\nIf H5N1's human death rate was any higher than those, Sly said, \"that's getting up there to absolutely catastrophic or disastrous terms.\"\n\nThe problem, he says, is we simply don't know exactly what's going to happen \"if this thing spreads into humans.\"\n\nWithout swift intervention and active surveillance, the possibility of H5N1 infecting more humans -- and gaining those fearsome adaptations allowing its onward spread -- could start to rise dramatically, multiple scientists warn.\n\nIn a report published in early April, European health authorities outlined various necessary measures, including enhancing surveillance and data sharing, careful planning of poultry and fur animal farming, and preventive strategies such as the vaccination of poultry and at-risk people.\n\nOn Friday, federal officials said Canada is planning to expand its surveillance for avian flu amid the growing outbreak of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle, with monitoring efforts now set to include testing of milk being sold on store shelves.\n\nBut there's concern in both the U.S. and Canada that actual government efforts aren't going far enough.\n\n\"People working with cattle should have blood testing done, on a regular basis, to see if it's popping up among that group,\" said Sly. \"Canada assumes the 49th parallel is a barrier against viruses, and it's not.\"\n\nHe says countries can't afford to look the other way, given the possibility of this virus eventually making its last few evolutionary leaps.\n\n\"It doesn't seem possible,\" Sly said, \"until suddenly it is possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

New England Medical Journal.The man's infection was mild conjunctivitis, which was first reported as April 1stand the CDC shared its contents Initial sequencing results the next day.\n\nConjunctivitis in the man's right eye began in late March. Although he had no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, he had direct contact with healthy dairy cows and with cows that showed signs of illness similar to cows at a nearby facility where H5N1 was confirmed. Although he wore gloves while working, he said he did not wear respiratory or eye protection.\n\nResearchers said the man's eyes may have been infected by touching them with hands contaminated with the virus or by being exposed to droplets or aerosols from sick cows or dairy farm activities. .\n\nMedical workers collected nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, which were found to be H5N1 positive through PCR testing. There was enough RNA in the conjunctival samples to sequence the entire genome, and scientists were able to grow the virus from both specimens.\n\nThe patient also developed redness in his left eye. He and his family contacts received oseltamivir, and over the next few days, the man recovered and no symptoms were reported by his contacts.\n\nIn a supplementary appendix, the researchers said they were unable to follow up on sick farm workers or other exposures of workers. They also noted that follow-up specimens could not be collected from patients to track viral load or duration of shedding. \"We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in dairy workers or household contacts,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThis was announced by a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. CBS News The Texas dairy worker said he came to a Texas field office for testing but did not give the name of his workplace.\n\nInitial sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the same B3.13 genotype circulating in dairy cows, and isolation of the virus from both specimens yielded identical virus. As previously reported by the CDC, the virus in this man's specimen contained a change, PB2 E67K, that is known to be associated with virus adaptation to mammalian hosts.\n\nIn a supplementary appendix, the group compares sequences from patients with available bovine sequences and finds that, while closer to bovine than B3.13, human sequences fall just outside a larger cluster of bovine sequences in Texas. He said he discovered something. Genotype viruses from wild birds or wild mammals.\n\n\"Sequence data from farms where infected dairy workers were likely exposed were not available,\" the researchers said, adding that there are gaps in previous sequencing images and that the virus has been undetectable for some time. He pointed out that this suggests that the virus may have been circulating without being detected.\n\nThey said the patient may have been previously infected with a slightly different virus, or there may have been multiple independent spillovers of the B3.13 genotype from wild birds to cattle.\n\nBut taken together, they write, the genetic and epidemiological evidence provides strong evidence of transmission from diseased cattle to humans.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seroconversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral load"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polymerase chain reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerosol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/layout_large/public/article/milking%20parlor%20worker.jpg?itok=kbG3cu6X", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Although he did not have a fever, and his lungs were clear, a case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday disclosed that he had frequent direct contact with dairy cows in the same region as other infected herds. The report stated that this would be the first recorded case of mammal-to-human H5N1 virus transmission worldwide.\n\nThe affected worker and his immediate family members who tested positive for bird flu were given antiviral medications, and they recovered without experiencing any lasting issues. However, swabs from the patient's eyes and lungs revealed a peculiar finding. His eyes showed a high presence of the H5N1 virus, while there was minimal virus detected in his lungs. This suggests that the worker might have been infected through his eyes, either by touching them with contaminated hands or through exposure to infected milk, rather than through inhalation into the lungs.\n\nDespite this worrying development, health officials are facing challenges in gaining the trust and cooperation of US farm workers who have refused testing for themselves and their animals on farms. The World Health Organization maintains that the risk to humans is low, but urges countries to quickly share information to facilitate real-time monitoring and preparedness as the virus spreads.\n\nIn light of this, the CDC recommends that farmers, workers, and emergency responders use appropriate protective gear when in direct or close physical contact with sick birds, livestock, feces, raw milk, or contaminated surfaces. This is a stark reminder of the importance of taking precautions when working with animals and the need for continual vigilance to control the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fomite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/may/birdflu-03052024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Since 2020, it has led to the deaths of \"an unprecedented number of deaths in wild birds and poultry\", according to the WHO. It spread to North America in 2021 and has wreaked havoc on poultry populations since then, leading to the suspension of meat sales from certain states earlier this month.\n\nMore concerning still is the spread from poultry to mammal populations, particularly cows. At the time of writing, 34 herds of dairy cattle across nine US states are confirmed to be affected, raising fears in the media over a lack of testing. This is due in part to the confirmation that the disease has spread in at least one case from cattle to humans. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, governments and the general public are naturally worried about the costs of ignoring up-and-coming public health risks, especially of the zoonotic kind.\n\nThere is good news, however. Only dairy cattle have been infected so far and the spread of the infection, too, appears to be low.\n\nIn an interview with Just Food, Alexander Anton, secretary general of the European Dairy Association (EDA), said: \"You have 33 dairy holdings that are affected out of around 30,000 in the US. In Europe, in terms of poultry - the species that is most concerned by avian influenza - we haven't seen a lot of outbreaks last year. We've known for at least ten years that it spreads to other animals. We had foxes ten years ago but we haven't seen anything at European level [for cattle].\"\n\nAnton also noted that it is currently flu season and expects the spread to slow as the weather warms.\n\nFrom the available evidence, it also seems pasteurisation is capable of deactivating the virus, keeping milk and cheese safe even if unknowingly taken from sick cows. This is good news for producers, as the US Food and Drug Administration has also found that one in five of its tested retail samples contain viral fragments of HPAI.\n\nTracking and containing the virus remains vitally important. While many cows appear to be asymptomatic, and still capable of producing milk, the risks of further mutation increase the more widely the disease is spread.\n\nDr. Daisy May, veterinary surgeon and current writer for All About Parrots, told Just Food: \"The public health risks remain relatively low for the time being. But we have to take this incursion into the cattle industry extremely seriously from a food supply standpoint.\n\n\"Intensive testing and monitoring on farms, at auctions, processing facilities - anywhere cattle co-mingle - will be absolutely critical for early detection and containing hot spots. Depopulation and virus elimination protocols may need to be activated at any newly identified infected premises to prevent further spread.\"\n\nTesting will reduce international fears over US beef and dairy supplies, Dr. May said. \"You can bet international trade partners will be scrutinising the US response closely, too, looking for any chance to rationalise import restrictions that could devastate the beef and dairy industries economically.\"\n\nThe US dairy export market is worth around $8bn and the beef market nearly $10bn.\n\nDespite the low public health risk, Dr. May still sees the coming months as key to maintaining faith in the industry. \"From my point of view, this is one of those make-or-break moments where coordination between state/federal animal health officials, industry groups, producers and veterinarians on the ground is paramount. We can't afford a disjointed, piecemeal effort against a virus continuing to prove its ability to adapt and find new hosts.\"\n\nThe export market for dairy, while large in absolute terms, is minimal compared to its domestic sales. Luckily for producers, there do not appear to have been any notable impacts on supply.\n\nThe latest US Department of Agriculture (USDA) report, published on 17 April, suggests that dairy yield was down around 0.4% year-on-year in February, continuing an eight-month-long trend, and makes no mention of avian flu as a cause. Dairy prices remain stable, with decreases in wholesale milk and cheese costs and minor increases in those of butter.\n\nThe major industry association National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) is also keen to highlight that thus far risks to public health and the supply chain remain low.\n\n\"It's important to remember what this situation is and what it isn't,\" Alan Bjerga, the NMPF's executive vice president of communications and industry relations, said.\n\n\"As FDA testing continues to show, this is not a consumer worry - pasteurisation is working, the milk supply is safe, and we haven't seen the type of consumer panic that can be created by misinformation and sensational media reports.\n\n\"Nor is the milk supply itself at risk - the number of farms affected is still a small fraction of the U.S. dairy herd, and the illness itself is mild in cows, with little long-term effects on milk production.\"\n\nBjerga did, however, echo Dr. May's statement on the importance of testing and monitoring. \"It's incredibly important at this moment for key stakeholders to work together. That means constant communication among farmers, veterinarians and officials.\n\n\"It means continually re-evaluating the situation to take the most effective measures possible, which is the spirit of the federal order [mandating wider testing and reporting for dairy cattle] that went into effect Monday. And it means honest, clear conversations about the exact nature of what we are facing, and the humility to know that facts on the ground change and we inevitably will need to adjust.\"", "source": {"uri": "just-food.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "just-food.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field Crops", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.just-food.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/05/Cows.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 3935, "textEnd": 3943}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

There are no confirmed cases in Utah, but they're still being extra careful.\n\nThere are 34 dairy herds that have been infected with the bird flu in nine different states. There are 30,000 herds in the United States.\n\nDr. Bruce Richards, who specializes in dairy studies at Utah State University, says most cows recover from the illness.\n\n\"It is not fatal in dairy cattle like in poultry. So that's also good news for the dairy industry, is that it's not fatal for us,\" Richards said. \"Herds that are infected do not have to depopulate their entire herd.\"\n\nHe said the initial infection of the current outbreak came from wild birds that brought the flu to a farm.\n\n\"It's an airborne disease,\" Richards said. \"Keep (birds) out of the feed to keep (the virus) out of the dairy barn.\"\n\nRichards said it is also found in milk.\n\n\"The good news for us as humans is that our receptors for (the bird flu) are lower in our lungs, and so infection in humans is rare. I mean, people work with dairy cows every day and they have to be milked every day. People handle them every day. And so far we've only had one positive case (in Texas),\" Richards said.\n\nUSU's dairy farm is carefully monitoring it's cattle.\n\n\"Next month, we're actually going to have a dairy producer field day where we're going to train dairy farmers on good biosecurity practices, good ways to keep themselves safe, to keep their animals safe, and then also to control wild bird populations on the dairy farm,\" Richards said.\n\nDr. Richards recommends farmers or those who regularly interact with cows wear rubber gloves, and even masks.\n\n\"Proper personal gear in the dairy parlor is important,\" Richards said. \"If you're going between herds, wearing plastic booties or rubber boots that can be washed can help decrease the spread.\"\n\nHe said the milk from sick cows needs to be thrown out, as raw milk comes with risks.\n\n\"Pasteurized milk is still safe to drink because pasteurization will inactivate the virus,\" Richards said.\n\nThe USDA recently made it mandatory for lactating dairy cattle to test negative for bird flu before crossing a state's border.\n\n\"As far as cow to cow transmission, it's important that we try and reduce movement of lactating dairy cows between dairy farms,\" Richards said.\n\nA manager at the dairy farm said they're also being cautious with their robotic milk machines to prevent transmission.

At a briefing on Wednesday, top health bodies revealed they could start dishing out doses across the board within weeks if it comes to it.\n\nSo far, there's no sign that H5N1 is going from person to person, but one farm worker in Texas caught bird flu in April after mingling with sick cattle. The man had a mild dose and got conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, the officials reported.\n\nThe bird flu crisis has hit at least 36 dairy cow herds in nine US states, including Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and North Carolina, reports the Express US.\n\n'Zombie virus' in permafrost could spark next global pandemic with expert providing warning Bird flu 'evolving' as 'cats go blind or die' after drinking infected cow's milk\n\nIf you can't see the map below, click here.\n\nWith the bug spreading fast, there's worry it may evolve in ways that make it easier to jump to humans, pushing top health officials to brace for the chance of H5N1 leaping from animals to people - or even worse, from one person to another.\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on Wednesday: \"[Studies] suggest that the vaccines will offer good cross-protection against cattle outbreak viruses.\"\n\nThe pair of jabs are already in the US' emergency stash, but only in small numbers, the officials noted.\n\nDawn O'Connell, representative from the Department of Health and Human Services, has detailed plans for dealing with a potential bird flu outbreak in a conversation with NBC News.

Providing an idea of capacity, O'Connell mentioned that \"over 100 million doses of the vaccines could be shipped out within three to four months if needed\".\n\nIn intriguing news, she also confirmed the US is pursuing the creation of a third bird flu vaccine employing the same mRNA technology used in Pfizer and Moderna's Covid vaccines. Ultimately, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would need to approve all three vaccines before distribution can commence.\n\nThe FDA has committed to staying \"actively engaged\" in preparations by assessing potential vaccines, ready to enter the breach as the situation necessitates.\n\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here.", "source": {"uri":

Thirty-six herds across nine states have tested positive for the influenza, as well as one person in Texas.\n\nThe herds that tested positive in Michigan are located in Ionia, Isabella, Montcalm, and Ottawa counties, state authorities said.\n\nBird flu has also been detected since 2022 in flocks in some two dozen counties.\n\nSamples of milk from various states have tested positive for the influenza but testing of 201 of the samples found that no live virus was present in the milk.\n\nFederal officials say all signs indicate milk and milk products are safe but have cautioned people against consuming raw milk, due to raw milk not undergoing pasteurization. Further testing is planned.\n\nThe USDA also said on May 1 that 30 samples of ground beef from retailers in states with herds that tested positive came back negative. \"These results reaffirm that the meat supply is safe,\" the agency stated.\n\nThe agency is still working on analyzing muscle samples collected at slaughter facilities and a beef cooking study.\n\n\"These data support a single introduction event from wild bird origin virus into cattle, likely followed by limited local circulation for approximately 4 months prior to confirmation by USDA,\" the researchers said.\n\nBird flu has also spread globally to other species, including walruses, bears, and seals, in recent months.\n\nThe authors did not list any limitations or conflicts of interest. They disclosed funding from the federal government.\n\nIn another preprint, professors from the University of Maryland School of Public Health outlined the results of a systematic review of literature to look at the history of avian influenza in cats and the possible danger cats pose as a potential pathway for humans to contract the flu.\n\nThe review showed that since 2004, there have been hundreds of avian influenza infections in cats, including infections without infections. Avian influenza started circulating decades ago in wild birds.\n\n\"Thus, we argue that surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed,\" the authors said.\n\nThey encouraged people who own cats to be aware of possible heightened risk.\n\nThe work was funded by the University of Maryland Baltimore.

USDA Study Shows Various New Mutations In H5N1 Virus Found In Dairy Cows - Thailand Medical News", "body": "H5N1 News: In recent months, a concerning development has emerged within the dairy farming industry in the United States. A strain of the H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu, has been detected in dairy cows across several states, prompting significant attention from health authorities and researchers alike. A comprehensive genetic analysis conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that is covered in this H5N1 News report, has revealed a series of new mutations within the virus, raising questions about its potential impact on public health and agricultural practices.\n\nUSDA Study Shows Various New Mutations In H5N1 Virus Found In Dairy Cows\n\nThe Discovery of New Mutations\n\nThe USDA study uncovered a total of 491 amino acid sites with nonsynonymous changes in the H5N1 virus strains infecting the dairy cows in the United States. Among these changes, 309 mutations were identified at sites associated with functional alterations, indicating a substantial level of genetic variation within the virus population.\n\nNotably, several of these mutations were linked to changes in pathogenicity, virulence, host range specificity, and mammalian adaptation, suggesting an evolving landscape of viral characteristics.\n\nNotably, variants affecting pathogenicity in key virus components like HA, MP, NP, and PB2 were detected, such as an increase in Q154R and S207G, a decrease in V105M, and an increase in D701N. Furthermore, mutations linked to increased virulence (Q134K/R, V67I, E627K) and host-range specificity (A55T, E57G, N71S, E229K) were also identified.\n\nOf particular concern were variants in PB2 associated with mammalian adaptation, with E627K, M631L, and D701N showing high frequencies, especially M631L detected in 99% of 214 cattle. However, the critical mammal adaptation mutation PB2 271A was notably absent, except for one sample. Additionally, mutations affecting receptor binding affinity were observed in HA, adding another layer of complexity to the virus's behavior.\n\nThese findings underscore the dynamic nature of the H5N1 virus and its potential to evolve rapidly, posing challenges for containment and control efforts.\n\nImplications for Transmission and Spread\n\nAnother key findings of the study was the ability of the H5N1 virus to cross species barriers, with evidence of transmission from wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle. This spillover event was followed by rapid dissemination of the virus within dairy farms across multiple states, including Texas, Kansas, Michigan, and New Mexico. The movement of asymptomatic cattle played a crucial role in facilitating the spread of the virus, highlighting the challenges in containing and controlling such outbreaks within livestock populations.\n\nRisk Factors and Concerns\n\nWhile none of the identified mutations individually posed an immediate cause for alarm, the cumulative effect of these genetic changes raised concerns among experts. Of particular worry is the potential for the virus to evolve in ways that enhance its ability to spread between species, including humans. The study emphasized the need for ongoing surveillance and monitoring to track the prevalence of these mutations and assess their impact on public health.\n\nTimeline and Epidemiological Insights\n\nThe timeline of the outbreak, as revealed by genetic analyses, indicated that the virus had been circulating in cattle for several months before formal confirmation by regulatory authorities. This period of undetected transmission underscored the challenges in early detection and containment of emerging infectious diseases within livestock populations. The study also highlighted instances of interspecies transmission, with the virus spreading from cattle back to wild birds, poultry, domestic cats, and even a raccoon.\n\nSurveillance and Preventive Measures\n\nIn response to the findings, researchers and health officials stressed the importance of enhanced surveillance measures, not only on affected farms but also across the broader agricultural landscape. Large-scale monitoring efforts were recommended to track the movement of the virus, identify potential hotspots of infection, and implement targeted control strategies. Additionally, the study advocated for continuous assessment of antiviral drug efficacy against the evolving viral strains.\n\nPublic Health Implications\n\nThe emergence of new mutations in the H5N1 virus within dairy cows raised significant public health concerns. While the virus had primarily affected livestock, there were fears of potential spillover into human populations, especially given the observed mutations associated with increased mammalian adaptation. The study highlighted the need for vigilance and preparedness in dealing with zoonotic threats, emphasizing the importance of early detection, rapid response protocols, and effective communication channels between veterinary and public health agencies.\n\nFuture Research Directions\n\nLooking ahead, the study called for further research into the pathobiology and evolution of the virus within dairy cattle. Understanding the mechanisms driving viral transmission, host adaptation, and genetic variability would be crucial in devising targeted interventions and preventive measures. Moreover, ongoing surveillance efforts would be essential in assessing the evolving risk landscape and informing evidence-based strategies for mitigating the spread of zoonotic diseases.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe USDA study shed light on the complex dynamics of the H5N1 virus outbreak in dairy cows, unveiling a landscape of genetic mutations that could impact its transmission, virulence, and potential for interspecies spread.

The man's infection, which was mild and consisted of conjunctivitis, was first reported on April 1, and the CDC shared its initial sequencing findings the following day.\n\nThe man's right-eye conjunctivitis began in late March. He didn't have contact with sick or dead birds or other animals but did have direct contact with healthy dairy cows, as well as ones that had illness signs that were similar to those at nearby facilities where H5N1 was confirmed. He said he wore gloves while working, but not respiratory or eye protection.\n\nResearchers said the man's eyes could have become infected by touching them with virus-contaminated hands, or from exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosols from sick cows or activities in the dairy setting.\n\nHealth workers collected nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, which were positive for H5N1 in PCR testing. There was enough RNA in the conjunctival sample for full genome sequencing, and scientists were able to grow the virus from both specimens.\n\nThe patient also developed redness in his left eye. He and his household contacts received oseltamivir, and over the following days, the man recovered, and no symptoms were reported in his contacts.\n\nIn the supplementary appendix, researchers said they weren't able to do a follow-up investigation on the sick worker or other exposures among workers at the farm. They also noted that they weren't able to collect follow-up specimens from the patient to track viral loads or shedding duration. \"We were also unable to collect acute or convalescent sera to assess seroconversion in the dairy farm worker or household contacts,\" the group wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services told CBS News that the Texas dairy worker came to a Texas field office for testing and did not disclose the name of their workplace.\n\nInitial sequencing found that the virus belonged to the same B3.13 genotype circulating in dairy cows, and virus isolation from both specimens yielded identical viruses. As reported earlier by the CDC, the virus in the man's specimen had a change, PB2 E67K, that has a known link to virus adaptation to mammalian hosts.\n\nIn the supplementary appendix, the group said when they compared the sequence from the patient with the available cattle sequences, they found that the human sequence lies just outside the larger cluster of cattle sequences from Texas, though it is closer to cattle than B3.13 genotype viruses from wild birds or wild mammals.\n\n\"Sequence data from the farm where the infected dairy farm worker was exposed to presumably infected was not available,\" they wrote, noting that the sequencing picture so far has gaps and suggests the virus may have been circulating undetected for some time.\n\nThey said it's possible that the patient was infected with an earlier slightly different virus or that there was more than one independent spillover of the B3.13 genotype from wild birds to cattle.\n\nTaken together, though, they wrote the genetic and epidemiologic evidence provide strong evidence of transmission from a sick cow to a human.", "source": {"uri": "cidrap.umn.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "CIDRAP"}, "authors": [],

There's a topic floating around on the internet even more important than Trump's new game show \"Name That Trial,\" and that's the H5N1 bird flu virus.\n\nBird flu did not rate much media coverage for years when it only resulted in the mass killing of chickens to slow the spread of the virus, with 90 million being the latest figure in this country.\n\nBut things have changed.\n\nJust as the current coronavirus that rocked the world most likely jumped from bats to pigs, chickens, hedgehogs, weasels, rats, raccoon dogs, and a host of other animals openly slaughtered and skinned at the Huanan market in China, bird flu is now jumping to new species in the U.S.\n\nMost concerning for Idahoans is the spread of the H5N1 flu virus to cows. Specifically, Idaho dairy cows which are kept in large factory farms are particularly prone to spreading diseases.\n\nAccording to a Sept. 5, 2023, report in Food and Water Watch.org: \"Idaho is home to at least 365 large factory farms, confining approximately 2.5 million cattle and calves.... You would be hard-pressed to imagine an environment more delightful to diseases than a factory farm.\"\n\nAnd here's the scary part: \"Moreover, corporations selectively breed animals to share traits so they're dependably profitable. This means factory-farmed animals share genetic material, which in turn means one sick animal can easily infect all the rest.\"\n\nThe dairy industry is understandably taking steps to distance the bird flu from its products as quickly as possible. It's even gone as far as to rename the virus. As a recent VOX headline proclaimed, \"The dairy industry really, really doesn't want you to say 'bird flu in cows.'\"\n\nSo, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners is rebranding the disease Bovine Influenza A Virus (BIAV), reminiscent of efforts by former president Donald Trump to rebrand the COVID pandemic.\n\nObviously, renaming COVID as \"Chinese virus\" and \"Kung flu\" did not make the deadly disease \"just disappear\" like Trump predicted, as it has killed around seven million people worldwide and over one million people in the U.S., so far.\n\nThe detected human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the US so far have resulted in minor symptoms. However, as reported by the World Health Organization, the fatality rate for humans worldwide over the last twenty years is a shocking 52%.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration reported last week that dead fragments of the bird flu virus had been detected in some samples of pasteurized milk in the U.S.\n\nMichael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, stated \"... dead particles are unlikely to cause a person to get sick.\" FDA officials said these samples do not appear to contain live virus and that the commercial milk supply should still be safe.\n\n\"Unlikely\" \"do not appear to contain live virus\" \"should still be safe?\" The wording is a bit concerning.\n\nIt seems that every day there is news of the bird flu spreading to a different species. From chickens to cows to goats to cats and, of course, most concerning, to humans. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this point.\n\nPork producers hope that pigs do not contract the virus as \"pigs can be a mixing vessel for influenza A viruses\" and create a new coronavirus, according to USDA research veterinary medical officer Dr. Amy Baker.\n\nAs soon as someone suggests humans suffering at the hands, or rather, hooves of pigs, one cannot help but recall George Orwell's 1945 prophetic political fable \"Animal Farm.\"\n\nWe hear the term Orwellian often when people reference Orwell's other classic novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" in their efforts to warn us about government overreach and totalitarianism.\n\nAnd, of course, \"Animal Farm\" targets some similar themes as Orwell uses the takeover of a farm by animals seeking freedom from the cruel farmer and its aftermath to illustrate the lies and hypocrisy of political leaders.\n\nGenerally overlooked by adults, but not children is the book's theme of \"revenge.\" The animals simply get to the point that they cannot take the abuse any longer and seek to punish those responsible.\n\nMany of Orwell's prophecies in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" have come true such as ubiquitous surveillance (video cameras), constant war (terrorism), and rewriting history (January 6 insurrection).\n\nMaybe the revolt in \"Animal Farm\" is an Orwellian prophecy being realized in the form of today's coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nPerhaps the pigs and other farm animals are at it again -- and who could blame them? After all, today's factory farms make Mr. Jones' detested Manor Farm in the novel appear more like paradise.\n\nAnd according to the Sentience Institute, \"70.4% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 98.2% of chickens raised for eggs, and over 99.9% of chickens raised for meat are living in factory farms.\"\n\nThose statistics, along with the world's current situation, make the animals' slogan in Orwell's novel most prophetic: \"Four legs good, two legs bad.\"", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We know that works.\"\n\nUnlike with Covid, Baker said a vaccine could be developed relatively quickly; the US has already stockpiled 10 million doses of shots targeting strains closely related to that found in the farm worker.\n\nHowever, in an interview with RNZ's Sunday Morning, US-based infectious disease researcher Dr Richard Webby voiced concerns the world would be again caught out.\n\n\"It may not be this virus, but something is absolutely going to do that,\" he told the programme.\n\n\"It's going to jump from an animal into humans and we're going to [have a situation resembling the] Covid pandemic all over again, or it could be the Covid pandemic sort of supercharged as well.\n\n\"There's clearly not enough resources going into this preparedness of pandemics, and that's not a New Zealand-centric issue, it's not a US-centric issue, it's a global issue.\n\n\"You know, it's almost like we're not willing to sort of put those resources into the insurance we really need.\"\n\nWebby, who heads Who's Collaborating Centre for Influenza Studies, noted another concern already flagged by the UN authority: that the world's public health agencies lacked the capability to diagnose it everywhere.\n\n\"If all of a sudden the virologic stars align and what's a bird virus in a cow one day suddenly gets all of the mutations it needs to be a human virus, then the chances of us picking that up in advance are pretty slim,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to find that when we start to see accumulation of human cases.\"\n\nFor New Zealand's dairy industry, he considers the current risk low - as do local biosecurity officials.\n\n\"I think if I were a cow in New Zealand, to be honest, I'd be feeling pretty safe from this virus,\" he said, noting the US infections were the first seen in cattle over 25 years of tracking the virus.\n\n\"If I was a chicken, maybe I'd be feeling a little less safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_morton@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Jamie Morton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Case fatality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Conservation (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Primary_Industries_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Otago", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Otago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/JODXOFAIEBJZWFZH43BJUWQSJY.jpg?auth=31f13476ee1d259f3754648e1685387885c85cf3d9e68d076a43b16fc0fa3b19&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

This is because the blood vessels in his eyes popped.\n\nExperts at the CDC say that they think he caught the virus from an infected cow in March.

The Texas patient came to doctors with the infection in late March, with scientists saying his vital signs -- such as breathing -- were normal.

On Wednesday, the markets had tumbled over concerns that a potential positive test would slash consumer demand.\n\nThe USDA has confirmed bird flu in dairy herds in nine states since late March. Old dairy cattle are often processed into ground beef.\n\n\"Today clearly showed even the computer algorithms were exhausted after the volatility and headlines the markets have faced this week,\" said Ross Baldwin, hedge strategist for AgMarket.Net.\n\nCME June live cattle futures finished down 0.125 cent at 176.675 cents per pound on Friday and lost about 1.1% for the week. August feeder cattle dipped 0.475 cent to end at 254.75 cents and were down about 2.2% for the week.\n\nThe USDA is still performing two other safety studies on beef related to H5N1 but says meat supplies are safe. On Monday, it began requiring lactating dairy cattle to test negative for the virus before being shipped across state lines.\n\nOne person, a Texas dairy farm worker, has been infected with H5N1 in the current outbreak. He was not wearing respiratory or eye protection and had been exposed to cattle that appeared to have the same symptoms as those in a nearby farm with a confirmed outbreak of the virus, according to new details on the case released on Friday.\n\nIn CME's lean hog market, June futures slipped 0.975 cent to close at 98.95 cents per pound and reached the lowest price since March 22.\n\nThe USDA quoted the wholesale pork carcass cutout at $98.12 per cwt, up $0.24 from Thursday, while belly values sank $4.08 to $116.85 per cwt.

Watch:\n\nThe images of the patient, plus further details about his unprecedented case, were published in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAccording to the experts, the patient developed a subconjunctival haemorrhage, or bleeding just beneath the conjunctiva, the clear surface covering the white part of the eye.\n\nHe patient is also suffering a watery liquid discharged from his right eye.\n\nThe Mirror report: The dairy farmer is now the second person to be diagnosed with bird flu in the USA, and perhaps the first to have caught it from a mammal - in this case, a cow.\n\nSo far, nearly 900 people in 23 countries have been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian flu over the last 20 years.

He also had no signs of fever, changes in breathing or vision during the infection.\n\nAfter being treated with anti-virals, the patient reported no symptoms except for some \"discomfort in both eyes.\"\n\nThe report added: \"Over the subsequent days, the worker reported resolution of conjunctivitis without respiratory symptoms and household contacts remained well.\"\n\nCDC Director Dr Mandy Cohen said that the patient's condition was \"very mild.\"\n\nShe told NPR : \"The person had very mild symptoms.

The situation is fraught with uncertainty, as not only the virus itself but also researchers' understanding of it is evolving. However, in some respects there is evidence that the United States needs to increase surveillance of pathogens on large livestock farms.\n\nAs of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has: report Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H5N1) infection in livestock have been confirmed in nine states. This virus is \"highly pathogenic\" to birds and many other animals. stickerbut for now, the CDC says the risk of infection to the general public \"remains low.\"\n\nEpidemiologists have long caused concern There is a possibility that a mutated strain of bird flu could adapt and infect humans, potentially causing a new pandemic. In 1996 he discovered that the H5N1 avian influenza virus was first detected; get infected Approximately 1,000 people have a mortality rate of over 50%. Bird influenza virus infected pigs in 2009swine flu -- caused an estimated 12,469 deaths in the United States. There have been no confirmed deaths or serious symptoms in humans due to the A(H5N1) virus.However, that Lethalness in wildlife widespread transmission among populations and their many species mammalianConcerns have been raised, including for dairy cows.\n\nThe most recent confirmed human case of the disease, reported by Texas officials on April 1, was likely caused by exposure to infected dairy cows. A Colorado case in early 2022 involved exposure to infected poultry. All cases were said to be mild. However, influenza viruses are notorious for changing shape. Given the ease with which A(H5N1) spreads between humans and the risk of it transforming into a pathogen with more serious health risks, we need to know where the virus originates, how it changes, and under what conditions it spreads. A vigorous surveillance program to track is warranted.\n\nUnfortunately, a key element of that oversight is missing: the farm. Officials with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) order Requires A(H5N1) testing for dairy cows traveling across state lines. However, a more extensive sampling program is needed. In addition to gaining insight into all cattle that remain in their home states, federal officials will need to collect samples from other species, especially pigs. critical bridge Between the influenza virus that kills birds and humans.\n\nThe USDA has the authority to require testing, at least for animal diseases. Federal law requires the agency to conduct \"operations and actions to detect, control, and eradicate pests and diseases in livestock, including animals in slaughterhouses, stockyards, and other facilities (including drawing animal blood and diagnostic testing).\" It gives you the authority to do it. Point of concentration. \" 7 USCA \u00a7 8308. Hog and Other Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), i.e. Majority Of all the livestock and animal products consumed in the United States, it probably falls under \"Other Concentration Points.\" Therefore, if the Department of Agriculture were to implement A(H5N1) testing requirements for pig farms, it would have a strong legal basis. The law requires the USDA to reimburse farmers for the cost of testing, but if the cost prevents the USDA from conducting critical oversight to prevent the next pandemic, it would require Congress to provide more funding. You should request it.\n\nThe pig industry may protest that A(H5N1) is not a disease that affects pigs, and that testing pigs for the virus amounts to a public health surveillance program. To the extent that this characterization is correct, it is problematic because the federal government does not have the authority to require or conduct public health surveillance on farms. Why are federal agents authorized to go to farms to detect diseases in animals, but not to detect diseases in humans? Congress must address this absurd contradiction. There is a need.\n\nAvian influenza aside, food safety is affected by the lack of authority for public health authorities to conduct basic epidemiological surveillance of farms. Recent studies in which the livestock industry has refused to cooperate with federal requests for microbial sampling include salmonella. Spread of infection related to pigsE. coli outbreak O157: H7 infection associated with romaine lettuce suspected to be contaminated It used fertilizer from an adjacent feedlot that housed more than 100,000 cows. Whole-genome sequencing of samples from pig and cattle operations involved in these outbreaks, as well as countless other operations, yields important clues about the origins of the outbreaks and how to avoid similar food safety failures. It is possible that However, under the current monitoring regime, livestock producers have no incentive to comply with sampling requests.\n\nFortunately, efforts are underway to resolve this issue. My organization, Consumer Federation of America, has joined other consumer advocacy groups. to support Expanded Food Safety Investigation Act.of invoiceCurrently supported by 10 members of the House and Senate, it would authorize the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to conduct microbial sampling of CAFOs for the purpose of investigating foodborne illness outbreaks and other public health needs. .\n\nSo far, the industry has not had to seriously address demands for clarification against seemingly common-sense measures like the law. However, as new pathogens emerge, such as the A(H5N1) virus, calls for reform will increase. Rather than reflexively blocking transparency efforts, livestock industry leaders should engage in dialogue and support the development of effective on-farm pathogen surveillance protocols.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers can protect themselves from A(H5N1) viruses in foods by avoiding them. raw milkpractice,4 coresSafe handling practices for meat and poultry foods, including eggs. CDC for workers guidelines Regarding the use of PPE.\n\nWith any luck, the A(H5N1) virus will be harmless to humans and will soon disappear from the public eye. But we should not wait for a crisis to begin building critical public health infrastructure. That infrastructure includes policies to effectively implement on-farm surveillance of pathogens that cause human disease.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_animal_feeding_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concentrated animal feeding operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/055/100/834/JWBKNELpyQ2r3mG3QPvbX5R93/e4b8e1f751986bd0aebb78a94909b79ed52e02a7.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 1611, "textEnd": 1618}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The Influenza A H5N1 lineage 2.3.4.4.b that emerged in 2022 spread across all continents except Australia, affecting and decimating several avian species. The outbreak has pushed many avian species to the verge of extinction and has spilled over to over a hundred mammalian species to date.\n\nIt is important to note that the recent outbreak in the U.S. is not solely affecting cattle; farm cats have also been significantly impacted. A total of seven cats have been documented to be infected in the cattle farms. Unlike cattle, cats infected with the virus exhibited severe symptoms, including neurological ones. While there's one documented case of a human with mild symptoms who had close contact with infected animals, the risk appears low.\n\nA survey in affected regions in the U.S. found traces of the genetic material of the virus in nearly 20% of grocery milk samples using PCR testing, although further studies also confirmed the absence of live virus in the samples. However, this survey also suggests that the outbreak might be more widespread than reported cases. Despite this finding, pasteurisation, a standard milk treatment effectively destroys live viruses thus the public health risk is minimal.\n\nGenomes and insights\n\nDespite controversy surrounding limited metadata, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has provided a large tranche of genomic data for the virus following the outbreak which has offered valuable insights into the outbreak. Most significantly, the data suggests that the virus had a single point of introduction in late 2023, and a potential undetected spread among cattle. A number of mammalian adaptation mutations have been identified in the genomes, consistent with the wider spread in cattle. The data also hints at the possibility of reverse spillover events -- transmission from cattle back to poultry -- which differs from previous avian-to-mammalian transmissions.\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nThere are several unanswered questions about the outbreak that remain unanswered. Firstly, the route of mammalian transmission among cattle herds is unclear, while speculations for this include contaminated feed, milking equipment, or even airborne transmission. Secondly, the question of how the virus evaded detection among cattle populations remains open. Finally, the potential of reverse spillover events from cattle to poultry, as suggested by the genomic data, necessitates further research to assess the risk of transmission to humans and develop appropriate mitigation strategies.\n\nSituation in India\n\nIndia has seen avian influenza outbreaks in poultry this year across four states, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and more recently in Kerala, and Jharkhand. These outbreaks have largely been limited to poultry. However, the genome sequences from these outbreaks are not yet available in the public domain and therefore the lineages of the affecting virus are not known.\n\nGiven the fact that the genetic alterations currently occurring in the virus are not adequate enough to enable human-to-human transmission, the immediate risk of an outbreak in humans remains low. However, close contact with infected birds or animals significantly increases this risk. Though rare, human infections come with a significant mortality rate, and therefore handling of affected birds, animals or infected material should be done only with adequate personal protective equipment and caution. The transcontinental spread of avian Influenza reiterates the need for active surveillance and a much wider collaboration among countries and organizations sharing data and resources for understanding the virus and its transmission dynamics. As the world slowly crawls out of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has never been a better setting for the global pandemic treaty.\n\n(Bani Jolly is a senior scientist at Karkinos Healthcare and Vinod

Additional conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the worker to assess viral levels or duration of viral shedding were also not available, the authors pointed out.\n\nSince 2020, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b subtype viruses have spread widely among wild birds worldwide, resulting in outbreaks in poultry and other animals. Recently, the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were identified in dairy cows and in unpasteurized milk in multiple U.S. states, as well as in cats.\n\nThe adult farm worker initially presented only with mild symptoms of conjunctivitis in the right eye. The worker had no changes in vision or systemic signs or symptoms, and also reported no contact with any animals, including birds, except dairy cows. Some of those cows were showing signs of illness similar to other cows in the same region of Texas infected with H5N1. Of note, conjunctivitis in humans from H5N1 infection has rarely been documented.\n\nThe worker reported wearing gloves but no other protective equipment when working with the cows. The worker could have contracted conjunctivitis through direct contact with hands contaminated with cow respiratory secretions, milk, or fomites or via respiratory droplets or aerosols from sick cows or the environment, the authors speculated.\n\nConjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from the worker's right eye, and initial testing of the samples were performed at a CDC laboratory within the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing suggested infection with influenza A and A(H5). Samples were then sent to the CDC for confirmatory testing.\n\nThe worker was told to isolate at home and was treated with oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg twice a day for 5 days. Members of the worker's household were also treated with oseltamivir for postexposure prophylaxis. The worker's symptoms resolved rapidly over a period of several days.\n\nWhile acute conjunctivitis is a clinically mild illness, H5N1 viruses, including those belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, pose pandemic potential and have caused severe respiratory disease in humans.\n\nThe H5N1 virus isolated from the worker's specimen had a change in the genome associated with adaption that is known to occur in mammals infected with avian influenza A viruses, including H5N1. However, the viral sequences from the worker and from cattle in Texas \"maintained primarily avian genetic characteristics,\" the authors wrote. No changes were observed in the hemagglutinin gene that would increase receptor-binding specificity in the human upper respiratory tract and increase risk of transmission to humans, Uyeki and colleagues noted.\n\nThere were much higher levels of viral RNA detected in the worker's conjunctival swab than the nasal swab, they wrote, which \"could reflect differences in viral replication in the conjunctivae and nasopharynx.\"\n\nAdditionally, the researchers found no genetic evidence of reduced susceptibility to currently available influenza antiviral drugs.", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MedPage Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharyngeal_swab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasopharyngeal swab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fomite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whole genome sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral shedding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/109xxx/109953.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 969, "textEnd": 976}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The worker recovered after several days following treatment with Tamiflu and all of the people with whom they live \"remained well,\" researchers said in the new paper. The worker was wearing gloves but no mask or eye protection when he or she came into contact with the cows, researchers said.\n\nThey said that the worker \"reported no contact with sick or dead wild birds, poultry, or other animals but reported direct and close exposure to dairy cows that appeared to be well and with sick cows that showed the same signs of illness as cows at other dairy farms in the same area of northern Texas with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection.\"\n\nHowever, they noted that they weren't able to test data from cattle presumably infected on the farm where the worker works.\n\nResearchers also said they could not obtain follow-up specimens from the worker, which would have allowed them to determine viral levels and how long the virus was being shed, and blood from the worker or their household contacts.\n\nDSHS says it has tested about 20 dairy workers, all with symptoms of influenza. Nationwide, at least 30 people have been tested since March, the CDC said in an update on Friday, out of at least 220 people monitored after exposure to infected cattle.\n\nOfficials say that there have likely been some people with symptoms who have not gotten tested. \"So we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1,\" Ms. Anton said.\n\nAnother farm worker in Colorado tested positive in 2022 after being close to poultry believed to be infected with the avian influenza.\n\nWhile that worker also recovered, worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, about half of people with confirmed cases of the avian flu have died.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oseltamivir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/id990704-chickens-in-texas.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 551, "textEnd": 558}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 938, "textEnd": 943}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But even as new tests show pasteurized milk is safe and agriculture officials impose testing regimens for interstate cattle moves, Republicans have another burgeoning concern -- that alarm means harm for the dairy industry.\n\n\"The issue I have is, because it's been talked about emotionally, people may respond to that,\" said Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. \"I just point to the swine flu [outbreak in 2009] that had nothing to do with hogs [but] had a significant negative impact on the hog industry.\"\n\nThere has been one reported transmission of the current H5N1 strain to a farm worker, in Texas. Scientists and federal officials have said that while viral fragments in pasteurized milk do not appear harmful, raw milk -- popular in states like Thompson's, where it is legally sold -- could still pose a threat.\n\n\"My concern is [the Biden administration is] going to be using this for more fear porn,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a vocal critic of the administration's response to another infectious disease crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic. His state, Wisconsin, has reported H5N1 cases in birds but not cows.\n\nRepublicans insist they are not dismissing initiatives to bolster infectious disease resources, at least among livestock. Thompson's committee on Wednesday released an outline for its renewal of the expansive Farm Bill, which allows oversight and support for agricultural programs that include the dairy industry, now in the throes of new testing and surveillance demands.\n\nThe bill summary says it \"brings together provisions related to livestock health and management, foreign animal disease preparedness.\" Thompson told STAT that these efforts predated the H5N1 outbreak, but that he is also separately pushing for more funds to back up the initiatives.\n\n\"Basically, we're trying to double what we invest in terms of the trifecta of animal health,\" or research, infrastructure, and personnel, he told STAT on Tuesday. That would be a roughly $2 billion investment -- through the budget process -- that he said has broad support.\n\nThe Farm Bill is scheduled for a May 23 markup by Thompson's committee, its first step towards passage; a new federal budget, on the other hand, is on a distant horizon. In the meantime, state health officials and farm workers have already expressed concerns about keeping up with new federal testing requirements for dairy cows.\n\nScientists and even some Democrats say that testing, and the federal government's information-sharing, have been too limited to get a clear picture of the H5N1 risk for other cows and potentially humans.\n\nSome were left shocked when the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month released data showing that cases among cows were more widespread than previously thought, and that viral fragments were found in milk.\n\n\"The basic question here is why wasn't more done to prevent this? Once this moves into cattle, potentially pigs, all this is increasing the chances for it to be contagious in humans,\" said Nigel Sizer, executive director of a network of scientific research and advocacy organizations, Preventing Pandemics at the Source.\n\nStephen Ostroff, a former FDA deputy commissioner for food and veterinary medicine, also voiced concerns about how widespread testing truly is, and the lack of clear public communication about risks.\n\n\"It's very reminiscent of the early stages of Covid, when we were flying a little bit blind, because we simply didn't have sufficient testing capacity to be able to know exactly who was infected,\" said Ostroff. \"The lack of context for it is really a challenge. How many samples were tested? Where were they from?\"\n\nDemocrats from dairy-laden states are also calling for a federal action plan to aid farmers struggling to isolate and test herds.\n\n\"The federal government has to step up to help our dairy farmers and producers weather and combat this outbreak, stop the spread of this virus, and ensure consumers know what is being done to keep them safe,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) said in a letter to agriculture officials Thursday.\n\nBut at least for now, Republicans are urging Americans to not panic.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the highest ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, in April asked federal health and agriculture officials for committee briefings on the bird flu developments.\n\nHe told STAT on Tuesday that he texted CDC Director Mandy Cohen directly and they are trying to set up a briefing, and \"she stressed that it's not spread to humans.\"\n\nCassidy admitted he'd \"like to have more\" information about potential risks, but \"it seems like they are appropriately monitoring it.\"", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType":

flu --something he's able to pull off because of his background in this area and his guarantee that the farms will be kept anonymous in the published work.\n\nWhat concerns him most is the possibility the outbreak could wind up at another kind of farm.\n\n\"We know when it hits the poultry farms because the birds die, but the pigs may or may not manifest severe illness,\" he says, \"The virus can

But bird flu doesn't care.", "body": "Kelsey Piper is a senior writer at Future Perfect, Vox's effective altruism-inspired section on the world's biggest challenges. She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nThe so-called \"bird flu\" H5N1 virus only rarely infects humans. Over the course of several decades during which it has circulated and resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of birds, about 880 cases in humans have been reported, generally in humans who work very closely with livestock.\n\nBut when it does make the leap to human hosts, H5N1 is often lethal -- out of 26 cases reported since 2022, seven people died. That's why it's troubling that H5N1 has been recently discovered to have quietly spread across the country's dairy farms, with testing finding genetic material of the virus present in 1 in 5 milk samples across the country. (Pasteurization kills the virus, so milk remains safe to drink.)\n\nThat prevalence suggests that H5N1 is now spreading in mammals -- and since cows on dairy farms are in frequent contact with farm workers, it seems likely the virus will have many chances to evolve to spread more easily among humans. If it does that, we may have another pandemic on our hands.\n\nNone of that is great news, but the thing that has struck me most about the bird flu outbreak is that among the general public, it's been greeted with a weariness that borders on indifference. The dominant attitude I've encountered when I ask people their concerns about bird flu amounts to \"Well, I hope that doesn't happen; I don't have it in me to go through a pandemic again.\"\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was awful for people -- not just for the millions who died and the many more who it hospitalized and lastingly affected, but also for the billions whose daily life it damaged, from lockdowns and school closures to dramatic new restrictions on movement and travel. You might expect that precisely because Covid-19 was so awful, the general public would be raring to make sure it can never happen again, by insisting our leaders do whatever it takes to be prepared for the next pandemic.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to have happened. Instead, with trust in our public health institutions badly damaged and many people suffering from pandemic fatigue, we now lack the attention span for the kind of serious policy response that could feasibly prevent the next pandemic.\n\nRepeated efforts to get a serious pandemic prevention program through Congress have fizzled. Despite the desperation of Americans to not go through this again -- or possibly because of the desperation of Americans to not go through this again -- we've basically decided to handle pandemic preparedness by hoping really sincerely it doesn't happen again.\n\nBut it will. If not with this virus, another one.\n\nH5N1 has never, as far as we know, had sustained human-to-human transmission. It may never mutate to be capable of that -- many viruses don't.\n\nThe CDC says \"the current public health risk is low,\" and while that gives me flashbacks to Covid, it's accurate at this moment; unless you spend a lot of time with cows or poultry, or drink raw milk, you're unlikely to be exposed unless the virus evolves new capabilities. H5N1 has been dancing along the line of human spillover for more than 25 years without making the full leap. Hoping really hard that it goes away might work out fine.\n\nBut if we are truly desperate to prevent the next pandemic -- if we feel very viscerally that we can't do this again, that our normalcy and our unmasked gatherings are among the most precious things we have these days -- then that's reason to prioritize preparedness more highly, not less so.\n\nWe need an actual, serious policy response aimed at looking closely at the possible origins of pandemics, at how to reduce human-wildlife interfaces. We should be closely monitoring research with pandemic potential, and work to improve our infrastructure for spotting pandemics early, developing vaccines and countermeasures.\n\nIt's very understandable that the general public doesn't want to have to become an expert in the different varieties of pandemic-potential virus out there. They don't want to check the CDC website for case numbers, don't want to see another round of school closures, don't want to let pandemics consume their life again.\n\nBut if there's limited public pressure to prevent the next pandemic -- the issue doesn't rank among the most important ones for the 2024 elections -- policymakers will evidently just not do it. So I think we have to, somehow, process the wreckage wrought by Covid, and turn our sense that we can't live through this again into a determination to do better so we never have to.\n\nPandemics aren't like earthquakes. They happen for predictable reasons, and we know how to stop them. It would be an enormous tragedy if we fail to get that work done because Covid-19 was so painful and so exhausting that we can't even think clearly about the possibility it might happen again.", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelsey_piper@vox.com", "name": "Kelsey Piper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive animal farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beSlMi6F8gNcZigb13231iK2B8A=/0x424:4915x2882/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25430296/GettyImages_1430874216.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Viral fragments have also been found in the country's milk supply.\n\nThe USDA confirmed on Wednesday that the ground beef samples had tested negative for the virus, but traders have nevertheless reacted to the outbreak. Live cattle futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dropped more than 6 per cent on Wednesday from above $1.85 per pound to below $1.74 per pound.\n\nThe USDA said it was confident that both the country's meat and dairy supplies were safe, but traders' fears that the risk of contamination could knock demand had nonetheless driven down prices, according to analysts.\n\n\"Perception is reality when it comes to food in the consumers' eyes obviously,\" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at broker StoneX. \"If they perceive a problem, whether there's a problem or not, there's a problem.\"\n\nHe added that announcements around the outbreak have \"had a big impact on the psychology of the futures market\".\n\nCattle futures had soared to record highs in recent months, as drought in the west and south of the US has forced ranchers to cut the national herd to its smallest since 1951, crunching supplies.\n\nWith prices rising, speculators piled into the futures market betting on further gains, said Suderman. But this week's announcements from the USDA have caused many of those traders to ditch those long positions, he added.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you introduce this uncertainty and that creates fear and managed money says, 'why should we continue to risk our money maintaining ownership of this asset, when we don't know what the next headline is going to be',\" said Suderman.\n\nLast week, Colombia banned the import of beef products from certain US states in response to the detection of the virus in dairy cows.\n\nThe South American country is only a small importer of US beef, said Suderman, but the market reacted when that news hit because traders were thinking, \"even if it's just a small customer, is this just the first shoe to drop, will there be more?\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

Welcome to MedPod Today, the podcast series where MedPage Today reporters share deeper insight into the week's biggest healthcare stories. I'm your host, Rachael Robertson.\n\nWe're kicking off today's episode with a rundown on what's happening with H5N1, or bird flu, brought to us by Kristina Fiore. Then Joyce Frieden tells us about a case that could change whether emergency departments can offer abortions. After that, Kristina will join us again to talk about the New England Journal of Medicine's surprising change to its embargo policy that will particularly impact medical publications like MedPage Today.\n\nBut first, the latest on avian influenza.\n\nH5N1 - avian influenza- is causing unprecedented outbreaks in mammals around the world, including U.S. dairy cattle. While this hasn't been a problem for people just yet, MedPage Today reporters have been asking questions about pandemic preparedness, including vaccination, treatment, and testing. Kristina Fiore is here to tell us more.\n\nKristina, what do we know about the scope of the H5N1 outbreak so far?\n\nKristina Fiore: So we know as of right now, Wednesday morning, that 36 dairy herds in 9 states have tested positive for H5N1. It's the same strain that's been found in wild birds in the U.S. since 2021. The first detection in cattle was in the northern panhandle region of Texas in February of this year, and by early March, similar cases were seen in other states, including Kansas and New Mexico.\n\nSo experts I spoke with suggest that the outbreak is actually larger than we currently know given two factors. One is that H5N1 was detected in samples from commercial milk. And the other is that viral sequences released by the USDA suggest that the outbreak began in December 2023.\n\nJames Lawler, MD, MPH, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security told me that the U.S. hasn't been testing adequately to be able to get a real picture of how widely the virus has spread in these animals, or even to the farmworkers who tend them, potentially. And the CDC reported that in this outbreak, 44 people had been monitored for symptoms and more are being passively monitored -- so they'll report if they develop symptoms. And a total of 23 people have been tested, and one has tested positive and that's the farm worker in Texas whose only symptom was pink eye.\n\nRobertson: So far, there hasn't been any person-to-person transmission, but should H5N1 evolve to be able to be transmitted between people, is the U.S. ready?\n\nFiore: So our reporter Jennifer Henderson took a look at vaccine availability. And she found out that there are currently three H5N1 vaccines approved in the U.S. by GSK, Sanofi, and CSL Seqirus. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, told us that it has a national stockpile program where it works with industry to test updated vaccines. And that program currently has two antigens that are very well matched to the current H5N1 clade that's circulating now. ASPR says that hundreds of thousands of doses could be deployed within weeks of regulatory action, and more than 100 million doses could be deployed over the next months after that.\n\nAs for antivirals - you, Rachael, had a great story out this week showing that experts think our current antivirals targeting flu would work against H5N1, because all influenza viruses have extremely similar internal mechanisms for reproduction. The N in H5N1 stands for neuraminidase. That's a flu protein that's targeted by our neuraminidase inhibitors, like Tamiflu. And we also have a polymerase inhibitor called Xofluza that interferes with replication and should work in H5N1 too.\n\nAs far as testing goes, the CDC told me that its public health labs all have flu surveillance that will pick up H5N1. It's also working with commercial partners to have commercial PCR tests ready to go to hospitals and clinics should those ever be needed. So in theory, we have the key bases covered should H5N1 jump to humans. But we all know there are a lot of surprises in a pandemic. And this is a virus that has historically had 52% mortality, which is why it's such a public health concern. Lawler told me that while that's probably an inflated number, even like a 5% mortality would be \"a society ending pandemic.\"\n\nRobertson: Well, how likely is it that H5N1 will make that jump into humans?\n\nFiore: Yeah, so everyone I talked to says they hope it's not likely. But given the unprecedented spread in mammals, they're keeping a very close eye on this.\n\nLawler said that the more it circulates in mammals, the greater the chance it has of adapting more effectively to other mammals, including humans. Then just this week, the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases published findings from an analysis of tissue samples from cows and cats that caught H5N1 on farms in Texas and Kansas. Now, the cows had mild disease and one of their main symptoms was mastitis and there were high viral loads in their milk. The cats, on the other hand, didn't fare so well. More than half of 24 cats on one farm that were fed milk from sick cows died. So it's pretty severe in that species.\n\nH5N1 has also been detected in a range of mammals in the U.S., including seals, foxes, skunks, raccoons, bobcats, and more. So H5N1 is around and it's in more mammals than ever seen before. The authors of that EID report called for much more surveillance to really get ahead of the spread of H5N1 in mammals.\n\nRobertson: Thanks for that rundown on H5N1, Kristina. We'll be sure to check back in with you as this story develops.\n\nFiore: Sounds good, thanks.\n\nRobertson: Yet another major case about abortion access is in the courts. Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a case that could affect whether emergency departments will be able to provide abortions when the health -- but not the life -- of the mother is at stake. The case is about a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA. MedPage Today Washington editor Joyce Frieden is here to explain.\n\nSo Joyce, tell us about EMTALA. What is this case about?\n\nJoyce Frieden: Well, Rachael, EMTALA requires hospitals and emergency departments that accept Medicare funding, which is basically all of them, to provide stabilizing treatment to any patient who arrives with an emergency medical condition, regardless of their ability to pay. However, a new law in Idaho known as the Defense of Life Act outlaws all abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the pregnant person, and anyone who performs an abortion not covered by the exemptions faces up to 5 years in prison. The rape and incest exemptions, by the way, only apply in cases where those crimes have been previously reported to the police.\n\nThe federal government is arguing that in some cases, medical care that a state may characterize as an abortion is necessary emergency stabilizing care that hospitals are required to provide under EMTALA. Examples of conditions that may necessitate an emergency abortion include ectopic pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, or a pregnancy complication threatening septic infection or hemorrhage. But the state of Idaho is arguing that the law would not prevent emergency doctors from providing necessary emergency care. Idaho says that the federal government \"has failed to present any credible evidence of any pregnancy-related medical emergencies in Idaho requiring, under EMTALA, emergency medical treatment that will result in loss of the preborn child's life but that the [Idaho] statute prohibits.\" They note that an operation to treat an ectopic pregnancy, for example, is not prohibited by the law in question.\n\nRobertson: So how are the Supreme Court justices reacting? Do they seem to be leaning one way or another during the oral arguments?\n\nFrieden: Well, you might not be surprised to hear that the court seemed to be divided along ideological lines. For instance, Justice Elena Kagan seems to be favoring the federal government's position:\n\nJustice Elena Kagan: \"All of these cases are rare, but within these rare cases, there's a significant number where the woman's life is not imperiled, but she's going to lose her reproductive organs. She's going to lose the ability to have children in the future unless an abortion takes place. Now, that's the category of cases in which EMTALA says, 'My gosh, of course, the abortion is necessary to assure that no material deterioration [of her health] occurs.' And yet Idaho says, 'Sorry, no abortion here,' and the result is that these patients are now helicoptered out of state.\"\n\nFrieden: The lawyer for Idaho agreed that such situations raised tough medical questions, but he also said that the state feels there are two parties to consider here, the pregnant person and the unborn child. Kagan didn't seem sympathetic to that argument. On the other hand, Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Idaho's lawyer whether there was any condition where EMTALA requires that an abortion be performed, but the Idaho law does not. The lawyer said there was, and it had to do with mental health emergencies. He noted that even though the Biden administration claims that abortion is not on the table under such circumstances, and also says no professional organizations have suggested such a thing, the American Psychiatric Association in a 2023 position paper says that abortions are \"imperative\" for mental health conditions.\n\nRobertson: So for now, the Idaho law remains in effect. What have the results of that been so far?\n\nFrieden: The law is definitely affecting care in Idaho, according to Jim Souza, MD. He's chief physician executive of St. Luke's Health System, which is in the Boise area. He said last week that during 2023, when Idaho's law was not in effect for emergency medical conditions, only one pregnant patient presenting to an emergency room was transferred out of state for care. And he said, \"In the few months since Idaho's law has been in effect, six patients with medical emergencies have already been transferred out of state for [pregnancy] termination. And if we annualize that, we can anticipate up to 20 patients needing out-of-state care this year alone.\"\n\nRobertson: Scientific and medical journals typically provide reporters embargoed access to their papers. That includes journalists from mainstream publications, like The New York Times or NPR, as well as the medical press. But the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) is rescinding that access for certain publications - including MedPage Today. Kristina Fiore is back to tell us more.\n\nSo Kristina, what is going on with this change?\n\nFiore: Yeah, so last month, one of our reporters tried to access an embargoed paper, and she noticed that the NEJM media site no longer had PDFs. So she emailed the press team, and they told her that they were no longer giving advanced access to reporters who work primarily for publications focused on physicians. That would be publications like ours, like Medscape, Healio, MJH Life Sciences, Haymarket publications, and so on. So of course, we looked further into this, and New England Journal told us that access will unwind as reporters apply to renew their media credentials. Some MedPage Today reporters have applied to renew their credentials and have been denied because our publication \"primarily serves clinicians and health care professionals.\"\n\nRobertson: That's a pretty big change. What caused it and why only physician focused publications and not everybody?\n\nFiore: We don't know. NEJM introduced its embargoed access policy decades ago. And when we asked NEJM, their communications director only said that medical publishing \"has changed considerably, as have our own publications.\" She said that parent company NEJM Group has grown to include \"several journals to which physicians and clinical professionals can subscribe.\" And that's happened as the number of media outlets focused on medical professionals has increased, she said.\n\nSo I reached out to Ivan Oransky, MD, who has written about embargoes extensively for decades and he told me that NEJM is \"apparently trying to grow their market share. They're prioritizing that over the free and transparent and sometimes critical flow of clinical information,\" he said. Oransky called it a really bad policy and he said it's a way backward with embargoes.\n\nRobertson: What are the next steps here?\n\nFiore: Well, we're all hoping that NEJM changes its mind and that no other journals take this approach. The embargo system was developed so that reporters could have enough time to report on studies accurately and gather outside perspectives on new research without the fear of being scooped, which could then lead to inaccurate, sloppy, or rushed reporting. And that's not good, especially in this environment of pervasive misinformation.\n\nRobertson: And that is it for today.

We truly don't know. We're basically flying blind. The second big question is how, where and when is H5N1 mutating?\n\nUSDA recently shared a few viral sequences from animal infections. However, data was incomplete. We need to do a whole lot more testing to understand how this virus has changed over time, and therefore predict where it might end up.\n\nAnother big unanswered question is wastewater surveillance. We created this wastewater surveillance during the pandemic which was a huge tool in understanding what areas need action. And we are starting to see H5N1 spike in wastewater, but there's a lot we don't know: Is this due to animals (we think so), versus humans? Is this from milk dumping? Is it from animal sewage? We certainly need more data and more visibility into that.\n\nOh, yeah, definitely. It's definitely more widespread. And for two reasons. One is that it was found in the milk supply, right? And this was surprising because milk from known infected cows was not going into the market. So this confirms that the cow outbreak is much bigger than previously known.\n\nSecond is genomic surveillance. We had a few scientists, citizen scientists walk through what they found analyzing the raw USDA data and what they found was there's an estimated spillover to dairy cows starting in December. So we think it's been spreading under our noses for a while and is bigger than what we're currently reporting right now.\n\nSo the risk to the average Joe on your corner in the city is very low. But I am more concerned about farmers, workers, emergency responders, really on the front line who are working with livestock every single day that are in direct and close contact.\n\nThey should really be protecting themselves right now, especially since we don't know how big this outbreak is. We don't know how effective it's spreading to humans. Well, yes, we have one confirmed case, but we haven't been doing more systematic or asymptomatic testing.\n\nAnd so there are a number of precautions that they can take. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are going to roll their eyes, but one of them is wearing an N95 mask, wearing gloves and really taking those precautions seriously.\"\n\nThere's a lot of similarities, but there's really important differences too. I mean, some of the similarities that are kind of haunting us, and I think I think that's why a lot of us are so frustrated, is the lack of transparency, data collection and communication, right off the bat.\n\nThis is slowly changing with H5N1, but we need to be better at that from day one. And there's a lot of differences too. One example you brought up is vaccines and treatments, right? We're not starting from zero. We have a stockpile of vaccines. We know Tamiflu works. We have some of these tools ready to engage. That was very different from COVID-19.\n\nThe other really big difference is that, I hate when people say 'this feels like March 2020,' because it's not an alarm fire emergency like we saw in March 2020 or even January 2020. I would say this is more like October 2019 where we're witnessing a spillover event and we don't know if it's gonna cause a pandemic or not.\n\nSo the actions we are asking the public are very different from COVID, but again, the government response could certainly be better, faster.\n\nI think that's what has been the main frustration is that information from that response has not been easy to find, if it has been able to be found, it's not necessarily complete and not necessarily backed with data, leaving a lot of us to kind of piece together a very fuzzy picture.\n\nI don't think it's malice, but what I do think is that there are just multiple players involved. Right? We have animals, we have humans, we have viruses, and all of these players have their own priorities only to authorities, agility, experience, politics, etc., that is really hindering a coordinated one-stop shop of information or communication.\n\nI will say though, that after a lot of pressure, government agencies have started finally hosting briefings for the media, as well as scientific experts, which I do think is a positive step in the right direction.\n\nAnd we can't take this long to respond because viruses spread a whole lot faster. And there's just so many practice runs we get before this starts costing lives.\n\nYeah, this is such a heated debate right now. Because there are pros, obviously to vaccinating animals. There are negatives though.\n\nFor example, it's really tough to know the difference between vaccination and infection and screening.The other thing is that this makes it, if an animal is vaccinated, it's more likely to have asymptomatic spread, right, so we're less likely to find it if there's a signal to be found.\n\nThe other very real challenge on the ground is that exporting cows and chickens and livestock is much more difficult if they're vaccinated rather than unvaccinated. There's lots of rules and regulations around that.\n\nWhat's not clear is what is the line, or that point where we have to start doing something? When is that? And it's not clear from the animal perspective, it's certainly not from the human perspective.\n\nI think if we start seeing human-to-human transmission, we certainly need to start really ramping up our vaccine manufacturing. I would even argue that if we start seeing this in pigs, I would start getting even more concerned because they're such a good mixing vessel for viruses.\n\nSo pigs are always kind of on our epidemiologists' mind as somewhere we do not want the flu going. And that is because pigs are known to us as mixing vessels.\n\nThey have both human and avian flu receptors, which makes it really easy for viruses to swap mutations. It's really playing with fire where a virus could figure out how to adapt a lot easier to humans.", "source": {"uri": "fooddive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Food Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_owens@fooddive.com", "name": "Nathan Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95_respirator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N95 respirator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizen science"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.fooddive.com/imgproxy/jNDiwZ6aQRmKUyBlKxUWZIlIpONdYBszP5td4Nn107Q/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTEyMTI5NzUxNC5qcGc.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 4222, "textEnd": 4232, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 4310, "textEnd": 4322}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 4354, "textEnd": 4366}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

To be clear, pasteurized milk remains safe to drink, but it does mean avian flu is spreading among cows. This week, the federal government required more testing of herds. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports.\n\nYUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Eric Weaver raises, tends and milks 200 cows in Lancaster County, the tenth-generation farmer to work land bestowed on his family by the founder of Pennsylvania himself.\n\nERIC WEAVER: Yeah, my ancestors would have gotten this piece of land from William Penn, actually.\n\nNOGUCHI: The work is in his blood.\n\nWEAVER: I just enjoy seeing cattle do well, seeing them perform well.\n\nNOGUCHI: But Weaver isn't sure what to make of avian flu. Federal officials confirmed cases in 34 herds across nine states so far, though not in Pennsylvania. Experts say it's likely spread far beyond that because cattle crisscross the country in the course of production. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture began requiring every dairy herd to test before crossing state borders. Weaver says, unlike many other farms, his cows don't mingle with others, something he hopes will protect them from infection.\n\nWEAVER: We're not buying in cattle, so it - that's something that helps reduce new diseases coming onto the farm potentially, but this disease sounds like it's passing from farm to farm easier.\n\nNOGUCHI: Much is unknown about this disease. Although, again, food safety experts say milk is still safe thanks to pasteurization. Fragments of virus are not contagious or dangerous.\n\nALEXIS THOMPSON: When we say we're very confident in our milk supply, that's part of it.\n\nNOGUCHI: Alexis Thompson studies cow diseases at Texas A&M Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. She says, by law, milk from sick cows is thrown out, but...\n\nTHOMPSON: You have to be identified as being sick, though.\n\nNOGUCHI: And that's Thompson's worry. There's been too little testing.\n\nTHOMPSON: We don't know how many animals have this. That testing has not been done.\n\nNOGUCHI: So far, only lactating cows seem to get infected, and none have died. But as happened with COVID -19, viruses can mutate, becoming more infectious or deadly. Thompson says dairy farmers are in a tough spot. They helped identify this disease in cows in the first place, but now testing or cooperating with officials comes with a risk of stigma and serious business disruption.\n\nTHOMPSON: It's very scary if you say you want people to come onto your operation because you don't know how that is going to disrupt your livelihood. They have been very understanding. They have been very helpful. They want to have answers, too. But at the end of the day, most of them are footing the bill.\n\nNOGUCHI: This, she says, is where public health must contend with the realities for the 28,000 or so commercial milk producers in the country. The USDA acknowledged this at a press conference last week.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nROSEMARY SIFFORD: We are trying to address, again, what we hear as anecdotal reluctance by just...\n\nNOGUCHI: Deputy administrator Rosemary Sifford said, USDA is assuring farmers its goal is preventing future deadlier disease. But outside of that, there's no financial incentive. Keith Poulsen directs the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nKEITH POULSEN: This is a pandemic-potential virus. I don't want to have a doomsday scenario here, but we know that flu changes. We think that's a very low but nonzero risk, but the longer that it's not managed appropriately on the farms, that potential goes up.\n\nNOGUCHI: And, he says, poultry and pig farms have similar concerns.\n\nYuki Noguchi, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LILY MOORE SONG, \"BEAUTIFUL LIE\") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Penn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rosemary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AP_04012904302-e1530203619855-1920x955.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9530556", "eventUri": "eng-9530556", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

It is rare for these strains of influenza to infect humans, although there are increasing reports of bird flu cases in other mammals such as tigers, polar bears, elephants, seals, mink, and pet dogs and cats. In birds, it causes a respiratory illness that is categorized as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic. Pathogenicity relates to how sick the infected animal is, and highly pathogenic avian influenza has the ability to spread beyond the respiratory tract to infect multiple organs, often resulting in death in birds within 48 hours.\n\nBirds, including wild birds and farmed and industrial poultry, spread avian influenza in nasal mucus, saliva, and feces. Avian influenza is very contagious in birds, and wild birds can infect domesticated birds and vice versa. Migratory birds distribute the infections globally, making prevention extremely difficult. Infections spread rapidly in dense populations, for example in industrial poultry growers.\n\nIn 2022, an outbreak in the U.S. killed more than 50 million chickens, not including many more million that were killed (culled) by farmers to prevent spread. There have been two human avian influenza documented in the U.S. Both cases had extensive exposure to infected mammals and the spread in the mammals listed above has been occurring more frequently and widespread over the last several years. Spread to mammals other than humans appears to occur after eating infected birds.\n\nThe genes of influenza viruses frequently mix in each animal that is infected with different strains of the virus. This gene mixing, or recombination, can result in influenza viruses that are able to act in new ways, for example, infect new species, cause new symptoms, and worsen the severity of illness. Presumably, a recent recombination event has made an avian influenza transmissible to and between domesticated cattle.\n\nSince this is a highly pathogenic strain (H5N1), it is not surprising that the virus is spreading beyond the respiratory tract into mammary glands and thus cow's milk. Since pasteurization destroys influenza viruses, it's also not surprising to find fragments of the virus in milk, but these fragments contain too little of the virus to cause illness or spread infection. H5N1 influenza is not the only virus that can have fragments present in cow's milk, and that is why pasteurization is so important.\n\nInfluenza has a complicated replication cycle within multiple species that frequently causes recombination events. Even those influenza viruses that normally infect humans (not avian influenzas) begin their replication cycles in birds and pigs. The new abilities gained by viruses after recombination events can contribute to the spread among new species and this is apparently what has occurred this year in domesticated cattle. Not only has H5N1 gained the ability to infect and spread beyond the respiratory tract in cattle, but it has also gained the ability to spread among cattle to infect the herd.\n\nThe outbreak is spreading rapidly in the U.S. This is very worrisome. The more cattle that are infected, the more recombination events occur. If the right recombination event or series of recombination events increases the severity of illness or death rate in cattle, the supply of dairy products and beef would likely be affected.\n\nThere is so far no evidence to suggest that pasteurized cow's milk or dairy products are unsafe for humans. Certainly, everyone should avoid unpasteurized milk or dairy products. This is especially true in newborns, those with suppressed immune systems, and those who are pregnant.\n\nThere is a lot we don't know, and parents should stay alert for notifications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as recommendations may change based on newly available information. Dogs and cats should not eat wild birds, especially waterfowl, although the risk to hunting dogs appears low. A frightening scenario would be a recombination event that allows H5N1 to cause severe illness and spread rapidly in people, which would have the potential to cause a pandemic.

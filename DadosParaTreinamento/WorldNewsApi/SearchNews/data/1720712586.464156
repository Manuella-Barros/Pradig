The 24-year-old social media influencer posted a loved-up snap of herself cuddled up to the Olympic swimming champion, 29, as they enjoyed a date night. Smiling at the camera as they sipped cocktails, Holly wrote: \u201c365 + days with you. I love you,\u201d in the caption and added in her Instagram stories: \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t stopped smiling.\u201d Just a few days earlier, Adam shared the same photo alongside a montage of family snaps with Holly, including her younger siblings and his three-year-old son George he shares with ex Eirianedd Munro, and wrote: \u201cGrateful for every second I\u2019m able to be present.\u201d Holly\u2019s famous parents were quick to congratulate the couple, with mum Tana writing: \u201cI love this x.\u201d While celebrity chef dad Gordon commented: \u201cCongrats both @adam_peaty @hollyramsayy.\u201d Since the pair went public with their romance last June, Holly and Adam have often posted loved up snaps on their social feeds with comments declaring their love for each other. Holly recently said of Adam: \u201cEvery day is better with you.\u201d While Adam gushed back: \u201cYou help me become a better man every day and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds with you. No one knows me like you do. My best friend.\u201d Though the couple have only been dating a year, Holly and Adam sparked engagement rumours back in April when she was spotted wearing what looked like a diamond ring on her wedding finger. Holly set speculation ablaze when she demonstrated her new skincare products on social media - but it was the ring on THAT finger that captured everyone's attention. Fans were quick to notice, with one writing at the time: \"Thought the first was an engagement pic\" before another fan wrote: \"I was thinking the same, I was like congrats wait how does daddy Gordon feel about it!\" The couple have continued to fuel speculation about their deepening bond and at the beginning of this year, fans noticed that Adam and Holly had got tattoo tributes to each other. Adam had the initial 'H' tattooed on his neck - while Holly had a letter 'A' inked onto her skin, intimately hidden behind one of her ears. Holly and Adam met when her younger sister Tilly appeared as a celebrity on Strictly Come Dancing in 2021. And in 2022, Adam \u2013 who denied any rumours of a Strictly \u2018curse - shocked fans when he announced he was splitting from mother of his child Eirianedd after three years together. In an emotional online post, the athlete wrote: \"Eiri and George, I'm sorry for letting you down. My only interest is for the well-being of our family at this difficult time.\" He recently detailed his \u201cthree years of hell\u201d as he opened up about his struggles with alcoholism and depression after his relationship broke down and swimming left him completely 'broken'. At one point he said he never wanted to see a swimming pool again after his career took a nosedive. Speaking in May 2023, Adam admitted he felt he was living with a \"devil on his shoulder\". He went on to say that he \"hears voices inside his head\", which caused him to doubt his abilities. He said: \"If I was going out to a race sometimes it would be 'you don't deserve this', even though I've done seven, eight, 10 years of work.\" He added: \"As athletes, our brains are wired a little bit differently, we are constantly chasing reward. How do you fill that void, especially when you're injured or in the off-season? You're constantly looking for a high or a reward and a lot of athletes do struggle with alcohol. It was something that I was constantly doing and I was like 'I don't want this in my life.'\" Adam has since got back in the pool and is competing again.

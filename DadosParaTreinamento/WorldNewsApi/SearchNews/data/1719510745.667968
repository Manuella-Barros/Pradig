In contrast, the former Union minister charged, the Congress-led UPA Government that got voted out in 2014 was \u201cmajboor, kamzor aur apang\u201d (helpless, weak and crippled). Addressing back-to-back election rallies in Bihar\u2019s Arrah and Jehanabad constituencies, Nadda mocked the UPA for having sent \u201cdossiers to Pakistan when the nation was rattled by terrorist attacks sponsored from across the border\u201d. \u201cWhen Modi took over, and Uri and Pulwama happened, our troops penetrated Pakistan\u2019s borders to conduct surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes and beat the terrorists inside their homes,\u201d he said. Nadda also praised the Government for scrapping Article 370, claiming it \u201cliberated people of Jammu and Kashmir, who had been held hostage by a handful of political families for years\u201d. \u201cIn the ongoing elections, Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing a record turnout. The enthusiasm of voters is a testimony to the liberating effect of abrogation of Article 370,\u201d he claimed. Training his guns at the RJD, a Congress ally that is also the BJP\u2019s principal challenger in Bihar, Nadda said the party stood for \u201crishwatkhori\u201d (corruption), was \u201crashtra virodhi\u201d (anti-national), promoted \u201cjungle raj\u201d (lawlessness) whenever in power, and was comparable to \u201cdal dal\u201d (marshland). Underscoring the improvements in the living standards of people with Modi at the helm, Nadda said \u201ctoday almost every household has electricity. A giant leap from the situation 10 years ago when 2.5 crore had no access to power and only 18,000 villages were electrified\u201d. \u201cTen years ago, almost every handset owned by Indians used to be made in China, Taiwan, Japan or Korea. Today, most of your mobile phones are made in India. We are manufacturing 97 per cent of the mobile phones we use. This is an example of the positive changes,\u201d he said. Nadda said PM Modi has not simply ruled but has brought a fundamental change in the country\u2019s political culture. \u201cThe common people, who had become used to a state of indifference, are now resolutely with Modi to take forward the pledge of \u2018Viksit Bharat\u2019 (developed India),\u201d he said. Nadda claimed that in the six phases of general elections that have passed, the NDA was ahead in enough number of seats to be well past the majority mark and \u201cwe are on course to achieving the target of 400-plus\u201d. The BJP president was on a whirlwind tour of the state, where eight seats were going to polls on June 1 in the final phase. He was scheduled to wind up his tour with a rally in Nalanda Lok Sabha constituency, named after the eponymous home district of ally Nitish Kumar, the Bihar CM and JD(U) president.

But it passed in at $1.62m", "text": "A five-bedroom home in Brunswick passed in at $1.62 million after two vendor bids at auction on Saturday. A handful of people endured Melbourne\u2019s wet weather to attend the auction of 24 Sturrock Street, which had a listed price guide of $1.6 million to $1.7 million. Just one of three expected bidders ended up making an appearance and did not make an offer. It was one of 793 homes scheduled to go under the hammer in Melbourne on Saturday. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 61.8 per cent from 553 reported results, while 79 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. With the small but reluctant crowd showing no sign of kicking off the auction, Ray White Brunswick auctioneer Jamil Allouche placed a vendor bid of $1.6 million before taking a short break to confer with the vendors. He returned to place a second vendor bid of $1.62 million, at which the property was passed in.", "summary": "The vendor placed two bids in the hope of kick-starting the auction of the California-style bungalow.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/property/news/young-regional-couple-outbid-developers-for-1-61-million-highett-home-20240627-p5jpb9.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1996229971724788%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/a2a098cc1ebce19724cd9c7cdbf60d76106265dd", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:37:20", "author": "Alexandra Middleton", "authors": ["Alexandra Middleton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.401}

{"id": 227491362, "title": "New Trier goalkeeper Annie Fowler saves best for last. This season, that is. Freshman is just getting started.", "text": "New Trier freshman Annie Fowler is not like most goalkeepers. Take penalty-kick shootouts, for example. They are the bane of many goalies. \u201cPersonally, I love PKs,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI really love them.\u201d She\u2019s also really good at them, as she demonstrated Saturday in the Class 3A state championship game at North Central College in Naperville. After making 11 saves during 100 minutes of regulation and two overtimes, Fowler stopped two of the last three PK shooters to help the Trevians edge St. Charles North 4-3. It was New Trier\u2019s seventh state championship under coach Jim Burnside, who broke the state record for career wins in a 1-0 supersectional victory over Lyons and has a 611-93-51 record. Burnside has never had a freshman goalkeeper like Fowler. \u201cShe has the poise,\u201d Burnside said. \u201cShe has the attitude. She\u2019s special that way.\u201d The Trevians (25-2-4) won the shootout 5-4 in six rounds. The first three shooters for each team made their kicks, with Sybil Evans, Charlotte Dellin and Josie Noble connecting for New Trier, while St. Charles North (18-3-5) got tallies from Laney Stark, Kyra Treanor and Juliana Park. New Trier\u2019s Addy Randall, who scored twice in regulation, then sent her shot off the crossbar. But Fowler responded by stopping Kayla Floyd without even leaving her feet. After New Trier\u2019s Honor Dold and St. Charles North\u2019s Kaitlin Glenn converted in the fifth round, the shootout was tied at 4-4, necessitating sudden death. Eleni Kanellos made her kick to give the Trevians a 5-4 lead. Fowler then dove to her left to stop Chloe Kirsten to clinch the title, although Fowler didn\u2019t realize it until all of her teammates started sprinting toward her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was one (round),\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI thought we had to go through all five again, so I was a little caught off guard. I was like, \u2018Whoa,\u2019 and the adrenaline started pumping and we got the result we wanted.\u201d Fowler\u2019s performance came as little surprise to her teammates, who have seen it time and again, just not in front of so many spectators. \u201cWe call her our little monkey,\u201d New Trier\u2019s Clara Deliduka said. \u201cShe\u2019s just constantly insane just from her energy. When we\u2019re practicing PKs, she\u2019s saving all of them. You get up there and you\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t want Annie to practice against me because I know she\u2019s going to save it.\u2019\u201d How does Fowler do it? \u201cShe just loves predicting, and I think (a shootout) is a great 1v1 situation for her,\u201d Deliduka said. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome with the 1v1s.\u201d That\u2019s not the only thing that makes Fowler stand out. She\u2019s poised beyond her years, as she showed near the end of regulation after a controversial call went against her. The Trevians were clinging to a 2-1 lead when Fowler was called for carrying the ball. The North Stars were awarded a rare indirect free kick in the penalty area just 10 yards in front of New Trier\u2019s net. With all 11 New Trier players lined up on the goal line, Floyd tapped the ball to Stark, who ripped a shot under the crossbar for her second goal of the game with 1:06 remaining. The call mystified many in attendance. \u201cI had never seen it either,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cThey allowed it the last game. It was crazy. It was surprising, and it maybe brought down my spirits a little bit, but I have the best teammates in the world. \u201cThey brought me up, and though maybe it wasn\u2019t the call we were looking for, my team was just excited we got to spend 20 more minutes with each other. That\u2019s how we kind of thought about it.\u201d Burnside declined to comment about the call but did praise Fowler\u2019s maturity. \u201cShe is a person who puts the last play behind her, and that is the greatest strength for a goalkeeper,\u201d Burnside said. \u201cThat\u2019s what she does.\u201d Fowler did so even after Glenn scored a great goal to give the North Stars a 3-2 lead with 7:14 left in the first 10-minute overtime period. The Fairfield-bound Dellin tied it at the 2:56 mark when she headed home a corner kick from Annie Paden. Park could have won the game for St. Charles North at the end of the second OT, but Fowler made a tremendous leaping save to tip a 22-yard rocket over the crossbar at the buzzer. \u201cBeing a freshman, I didn\u2019t want to let my seniors down,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI kind of owed it to my team, and having such great defenders and forwards, they were able to carry me through that overtime.\u201d Fowler saw the shootout as a chance for redemption and wasn\u2019t worried even after Randall\u2019s missed shot. \u201cMy team had been playing for 100 minutes,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI made a huge mistake. That happens. I was not going down without a fight. \u201cI knew after that miss happened, it was just like, \u2018If you have my back, I have yours.\u2019\u201d That has endeared Fowler to her teammates, and not only the defenders like Deliduka, Dold, Basie Shannon and Kennedy Colegrove, who helped New Trier record 26 shutouts and allow just eight goals this season. \u201cShe\u2019s the best goalie I know,\u201d Randall said. \u201cShe\u2019s tough as nails, and she goes for every ball. She has an insane amount of composure and discipline, and she works so hard. Everything she\u2019s got, she\u2019s deserved.\u201d Fowler\u2019s coolness in the heat of the championship match will only raise the level of esteem she receives. \u201cWe recognize that underclassmen, we definitely have more nerves because we don\u2019t have experience, but with Annie Fowler, it\u2019s really the complete opposite,\u201d Randall said. \u201cShe\u2019s really composed and mature about stuff like that.\u201d The Trevians stay composed throughout a season that ended with a 19-game unbeaten streak, including wins in their final 10 matches. As good as players like Fowler were individually, no one took all of the credit for that success. \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of great people, especially this group,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cThese defenders, I would trust them with my life. I think I owe (stats) more to them than me. I rarely got any action this season because they are a brick wall.\u201d Matt Le Cren is a freelance reporter.", "summary": "Fowler stops two of St. Charles North's last three attempts in the shootout as New Trier wins the state title.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/02/3a-girls-soccer-annie-fowler-new-trier-st-charles-north/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PPN-L-GSO-NEW-TRIER-0602-3-e1717330499317.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:23:46", "author": "Matt Le Cren", "authors": ["Matt Le Cren"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.039}

Recently, golf enthusiast Chris McKee suggested a potential career for Mickelson after he retires from golf.\n\nMcKee asked whether the six-time major winner would join CBS, ESPN, NBC, or Sky Sports as a PGA broadcaster, or join LIV Golf broadcasts. Surprisingly, Phil Mickelson answered the question, saying he would probably want to continue playing.\n\nChris McKee shared a short clip of Phil Mickelson with the caption:\n\n\"The second Phil Mickelson retires he'll instantly become the most sought after TV analyst in golf. Would any PGA Tour broadcaster (CBS, ESPN, NBC or Sky) bring him in or would he have to stick to LIV broadcasts? #LIVGolf\"\n\nThe HyFlyers captain jumped into the comments section to write:\n\n\"Thank you for the kind words. However, just cuz someone CAN do something doesn't mean they SHOULD do it. Instead of commentating, I'm going to shoot some Pros vs Schmos 9 hole matches. I'll share insights throughout as well as talk a little smack. It won't be the highest quality video but it'll be fun for me to do and fun to watch I think too.\"\n\nInterestingly, Ian Poulter, who also plays on the LIV Golf series, accepted Mickelson's offer. He commented that although they would have played against one another as Ryder Cup captains, that possibility no longer exists. As a result, Poulter is interested in playing nine-hole matches against Mickelson.\n\n\"I'm happy to be the Schmos if you like.. just like we could have been Ryder Cup Captains against each other.

Tartans trousers only.\"\n\nIt is important to note that both Phil Mickelson and Ian Poulter have strong records in the Ryder Cup. They could have been future captains of the biennial tournaments, but both have joined LIV Golf, diminishing their chances of being part of the Ryder Cup.\n\nWhen will Phil Mickelson and Ian Poulter play next?\n\nIan Poulter will tee off at the LIV Golf Houston event next. The Saudi Circuit event is slated to take place from June 7 to 9 at the Golf Club of Houston.\n\nBefore this, Phil Mickelson is set to compete at the PGA Championship 2024 next week. The upcoming major will feature a stellar field, including PGA Tour and LIV Golfers. However, Poulter will miss the tournament.\n\nMickelson is exempted to compete in the Major as he won the PGA Championship in 2021, granting him a five-year exemption to compete in all four majors.\n\nPhil Mickelson and Ian Poulter last competed at the LIV Golf Singapore event, where Poulter finished in 36th place while Mickelson finished in 22nd place.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankita_yadav@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ankita Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Poulter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian Poulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/b7427-17152345483578-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554073", "eventUri": "eng-9554073", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "dateEnd": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 2212, "textEnd": 2223}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Or is it? Phil's LIV Golf contract, estimated to be worth around $200 million, is reportedly set to expire in 2025 and at this point only Lefty knows what will happen after that. However, he reveal a portion of his retirement plans this week on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nIn response to a fan saying that Phil Mickelson would become the most sought after TV analyst in golf the moment he retires (which I believe is true, by the way), Phil responded saying that talking about golf on TV broadcasts likely isn't in his future. Phil said:\n\n\"Thank you for the kind words. However, just cuz someone CAN do something doesn't mean they SHOULD do it. Instead of commentating, I'm going to shoot some Pros vs Schmos 9 hole matches. I'll share insights throughout as well as talk a little smack. It won't be the highest quality video but it'll be fun for me to do and fun to watch I think too.\"\n\nIn response to that, PGA Tour golfer Wesley Bryan (1 win) says he'd love to be included. Ian Poulter also told Phil he'd like to get in on the action:\n\nMardy Fish chimed in with \"Happy to let you teach me how to golf too buddy.\" Someone else suggested that Phil starts a podcast where he only interviews left-handed professional athletes.\n\nEvery serious golf fan would watch this and a LOT of casual fans would as well. Mickelson has a knack for speaking about the game that few others in the world can come close to. He also has an unmatched creative eye for the game that's sorely missed on the PGA Tour these days but is one of the primary reasons to tune into the LIV Golf broadcasts. I once watched him hit a shot backwards at a tournament in New Jersey, on purpose, and the bleachers went absolutely nuts.\n\nSo yeah, this would be a great retirement option for Phil Mickelson but he's already earning millions so making this project worth his time would be tricky. Distribution (TV? YouTube? Private streaming service?) would be the first obstacle to sort out in order to determine if the monetization is worth the grind for Phil Mickelson in retirement.\n\nBut with videos like Bryson vs Phil and the gambling clip that emerged, this would be a winning venture if Phil Mickelson pursues it in retirement.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cass_anderson@brobible.com", "name": "Cass Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiawah_Island,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiawah Island, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiawah Island, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Poulter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Poulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Bryan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardy_Fish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mardy Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/phil-mickelson-liv-golf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554073", "eventUri": "eng-9554073", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

That's not for old Lefty though, and instead he plans to film his own segment where pros take on - assumedly - famous non pros, all in the name of content.\n\nThe idea has a fan in Poulter, who replied to Mickelson confirming he's game, given they won't be facing off as Ryder Cup captains. The LIV defectors have taken themselves out of the running to lead the European and US teams respectively after joining the Saudi-backed breakaway tour. The door has been left open for star players to still compete, such as Europe's Jon Rahm and Tyrell Hatton.\n\nBut golf politics would appear to have ruled out any of the more experienced LIV guys being considered for captaincy roles. Luke Donald will continue his reign after securing victory for Europe in Rome last year. Poulter is a Ryder Cup specialist on the course, but isn't likely to be welcomed on board as a captain or vice captain any time soon.\n\nHowever, the US are yet to confirm who will succeed Zach Johnson.

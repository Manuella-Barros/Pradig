The tasty sausage creation then was named third in Scotland in the national listing. David Thomson, Thomas Johnston Butchers\u2019 director, said the award was a tremendous credit to the hard work of the company\u2019s 35-strong team. He added: \u201cIt is tremendous to be recognised at this level for our products. This company has been making beef link sausages to pretty much that same recipe since 1861. It\u2019s only had a few tweaks over the years and we\u2019re all absolutely thrilled that it has proved a winner. \u201cWe pride ourselves on using the best locally sourced meats and making our links by hand in the traditional way and the team works hard at keeping our tried and tested products up to standard. \u201cTo lift the regional title and to be recognised as third best in Scotland is tremendous.\u201d All of the butchers at the Falkirk business are expert link sausage makers, turning out around 100kg of beef links alone each week. \u201cThey\u2019re experts at it,\u201d said David, who accepts they may have to produce even more beef links to meet demand following their award. Thomas Johnston Butchers have enjoyed their most glittering year yet with recognition at national and international level for products including their pork link sausages, sausage rolls and steak pie. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a rollercoaster for us all,\u201d said David, \u201cand this is just the icing on the cake.\u201dScottish Craft Butchers Executive Manager Gordon King said the standard of this year\u2019s entry had been extremely high with more than 70 butchers from all over Scotland competing for the title. He said: \u201cThis is something that skilled butchers in every part of the country are producing day in and day out \u2013 most handmade and in small batches. This Championship brings together some of the finest butchers in the country and the team at Thomas Johnston Butchers should be justifiably proud of their regional title.\u201d", "summary": "A Falkirk butcher has added to its already bulging 2024 trophy cabinet by capturing another title.", "url": "https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/news/people/sausage-success-in-national-championships-for-falkirk-town-centre-butcher-4646269", "image": "https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmY4ZDcxYjllLWUyNGItNGE2Mi1iZDVlLWFjMmZhOTczMTBiYjpkZDdkZTcyMi05YTkzLTRjNDgtOTJiMC0xYzkzNmQ1ZGI1MmM=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:34:16", "author": "James Trimble", "authors": ["James Trimble"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.722}

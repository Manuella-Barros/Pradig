But even the best have moments they'd like to take back.\n\nIn the latest episode of \"Big Noon Conversations,\" Joel Klatt asked Sarkisian what the most regrettable playcall of his career was. He had to ponder for a brief moment.\n\n[Read more: Steve Sarkisian explains how he's created a 'culture of vulnerability' at Texas]\n\n\"Oh my gosh, let me think about this,\" Sarkisian initially said.\n\nSarkisian didn't ponder for too long, though.\n\n\"Well, yeah, I know exactly what it was: Fourth-and-2, USC playing Texas in the national championship game,\" Sarkisian said.\n\nNearly 15 years to the day that he became Texas' head coach, Sarkisian was coaching against the Longhorns in the 2006 Rose Bowl as USC's quarterbacks coach. Holding a 38-33 lead, the Trojans were just 2:13 away from becoming the first team in nearly 70 years to three-peat as national champions.\n\nUSC needed to pick up 2 yards on a fourth-and-2 from Texas' 44-yard line. Instead of going to that year's Heisman Trophy winner, Reggie Bush, Sarkisian opted to give the ball to running back LenDale White.\n\nWhite wasn't able to power past Texas' front, getting stuffed just in front of the first-down marker. A measurement confirmed that White failed to get the first down.\n\nTexas' fourth-down stop preceded one of the most iconic moments in college football history. On the ensuing Longhorns' drive, Vince Young led Texas down the field, running in an 8-yard score on fourth-and-5, which helped put Texas up, 41-38, with 19 seconds remaining.\n\nUSC wasn't able to get the ball past midfield on the final possession, ending its dreams of a three-peat. It also caused many to question why White got the ball instead of Bush with the opportunity to seal the win with over two minutes left.\n\nWhen Sarkisian named that as his most regrettable playcall, Klatt was a bit surprised.\n\n\"You didn't like that call?\" Klatt said. \"You ran power.\"\n\n\"We ran power, and we had been running it all game,\" Sarkisian said.\n\n\"I think you averaged 12 yards per carry on that specific play, with LenDale White,\" Klatt said.\n\nIn addition to that stat, there were multiple reasons why it was understandable for Sarkisian to go to White in that instance. He served as USC's power back all year long, rushing for 1,302 yards on 6.6 yards per carry with 24 touchdowns. He had rushed for 123 yards on 6.5 yards per carry before the fourth-down run. In fact, he actually rushed for a five-yard gain on the previous play, though he did fumble the ball.\n\nEven though the process of giving the ball to White might have been sound, that ultimately doesn't matter to Sarkisian.\n\n\"Here's my thing about playcalling: Playcalls are good when they work, they're terrible when the play doesn't work,\" Sarkisian said. \"That's the history of playcalling. ... That play, I'll never forget. It's probably one of the reasons why I'll never forget that. I want a million playcalls back.\"\n\nObviously, that moment didn't set Sarkisian's career back. He later became the head coach at Washington and USC. Following his ouster at USC, he worked as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons before becoming an offensive coordinator again at the college level for Alabama.\n\nNow, Sarkisian's seemingly one of the few head coaches who still calls plays in the sport.\n\n\"I think it's sustainable,\" Sarkisian said of calling plays while handling the duties of being a college head coach. \"I think the thing for me, and I can't speak for everybody else, you try to hire really good people as best you can and people who are really competent and excel at what they do. Then, you try to get them to understand the way we think, the way I think as the head coach, so that they can make some of the day-to-day operational decisions on different things.\"\n\nTexas' offense ranked ninth in the nation in yards last season en route to a 12-2 year. Sarkisian's favorite playcall of his career actually came in Texas' 49-21 win over Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship Game.\n\n\"I was sitting with Coach [A.J.] Milwee, our quarterback coach, the night before the game. I said 'Hey, the first time we get third-and-2, third-and-3, I'm gonna go with the odds that we're gonna get man coverage and we call the double-reverse pass and hit [Ja'Tavion] Sanders wide-open for a touchdown.' I said, 'That's going to be the call. I don't care if we're on our own 10 or if we're going in, that's the call.'\n\n\"Sure enough, it came up in the game and our guys hit it. We hit [Sanders] and like all our kids know what's happening. So when we called it and for it to hit the way that it hit, it was a pretty special deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LenDale_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LenDale White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klatt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Klatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Bush", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS_National_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BCS National Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose Bowl Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/steve-sarkisian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669216", "eventUri": "eng-9669216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

It's well-earned, with Arch Manning, CJ Baxter, Colin Simmons, Ryan Wingo, Anthony Hill and Dia Bell, if he signs, being a few of the five-stars that have joined the Longhorns during his tenure.\n\nRecruiting is a complicated process, but part of Sarkisian's success is based on him being open and honest with his players. To the coach, that means opening up about his own past personal struggles with alcohol.\n\n\"So it really wasn't like something that I could hide from. This is public knowledge,\" Sarkisian said on the Joel Klatt Show. \"In coaching, there's this thing called negative recruiting. ... Other schools and other coaches were going to try to use that against me. So I really became open honest and vulnerable with the recruits first to talk through my story.\"\n\nSarkisian hit rock bottom after a 2015 incident at USC when he was fired for alcohol abuse. He entered rehabilitation. Without many other options, former Alabama coach Nick Saban gave him another chance in 2016 to rejoin the coaching world.\n\nAfter two stints at Alabama and a brief appearance with the Falcons, Sarkisian was eventually hired at Texas. His troubles at USC were far from undocumented, yet Sarkisian says that he gives his recruits his own unfiltered version of the events when talking to them.\n\n\"Eighteen-to-22 (year-old) males. If there's a guarded group of individuals in our society, it's that group right?\" Sarkisian said. \"Being vulnerable, being open, being honest ... so how do I get them to feel comfortable to do that? Uncut, it's the version that they're sitting in their chairs thinking 'I can't believe coach Sark just said all of that to us.'\"\n\nSarkisian brought in the sixth-ranked signing class in 2024 and the No. 3 class in 2023. His mistakes may have tarnished his past, but at the same time it's clear Sarkisian has learned from them.\n\n\"And now, what happens is there's some empathy.

Even when moving from an offensive coordinator to a head coach, Sarkisian kept the duty. After all, it's why he's considered one of the top head coaches in college football after sporting multiple elite offenses.\n\nSo, FOX's Joel Klatt asked Sarkisian to reflect on his career thus far and figure out the worst and best play call.\n\nThe worst came to him instantly, being a moment Texas fans have remembered 20 years later. Calling a run play on fourth down for USC in the 2006 BCS National Championship game, with the Longhorns making a stand at the line of scrimmage.\n\n\"4th and 2, USC playing Texas in the national championship game,\" Sarkisian said.\n\nKlatt interjected, asking \"You don't like the call? You ran power. I think you averaged 12 yards per carry on that specific play with LenDale White.\"\n\n\"Here's my thing about play calling,\" Sarkisian responded. \"Play calls are good when they work. They're terrible when the play doesn't work. That's the history of playcalling... That play I will never forget.\"\n\nVince Young was given the ball back with just a few minutes left and the rest is history. Texas won the national championship while Sarkisian, despite now being in Austin, has bad memories of the moment.\n\nShifting to a more positive moment, Sarkisian says the best play call of his career was recent. Texas was in the Big 12 Championship game against Oklahoma State, needing to whip up some magic. Sarkisian may have already had a seven-point lead but he pulled out a trick play to go up by two scores.\n\n\"We were playing Oklahoma State, Big 12 Championship game,\" Sarkisian said. \"I was sitting with Coach (AJ) Milwee, our quarterbacks coach the night before the game. We had an early kick and I said 'The first time we get 3rd and 2 or 3rd and 3, I'm going with the odds -- we're getting man coverage.'\n\n\"We called a double reverse pass and had JT Sanders wide open for a touchdown. I said 'That's going to be the call. I don't care if we're on our own 10, that's the call.' And sure enough, it came up in the game and our guys hit it.

He also fulfilled the prophecy of Texas becoming the Big 12 Conference Champions and tacked on the program's first College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nBut Sarkisian's road to victory last year is a product of his past experiences working alongside two of college football's most recognized coaches, Nick Saban and Pete Carroll. In Sarkisian's most recent interview with Joel Klatt, he spoke about what he learned from the duo, who have since retired from the game.\n\n\"The biggest thing I got from those two: dramatically different personalities,\" Sarkisian said. \"Here's Pete Carroll, he's bouncing around, he's chewing gum, he's playing catch every day, he's got his gloves on, he's creating an environment of energy. Here's Nick Saban, the methodical regiment, the discipline of this is how we're going to go about our business and this is the approach.\"\n\nSarkisian held the role of offensive assistant and assistant head coach under Carroll at USC in the early 2000s, leaving the program for a head coaching position at Washington ahead of Carroll's departure to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIn 2016, Sarkisian would find himself at Alabama as a team analyst, later being promoted to offensive coordinator just in time to see the Tide's national championship game against Clemson.\n\nHe said that despite their polar opposite mindsets, Saban and Carroll agreed on the fact that they wanted to create a winning program.\n\n\"In the end, they're both striving for the same thing, which is being champions,\" Sarkisian said. \"They're both highly competitive, two of the most competitive humans I've ever been around, and they're both extremely successful.\"\n\nWhile Texas defeated Alabama in Tuscaloosa last season, that was only a minor bump in Saban's career, as he posed a 292-71-1 record across four universities, including seven national championships. Carroll's only college head coaching experience came from USC, but he led the Trojans to a national championship appearance against Texas and later became a Super Bowl winner with the Seahawks in 2014.\n\nSarkisian mentioned that with both Carroll and Saban, the most success came in the later half of their careers, and when he asked them what flipped the switch, he said he got nearly the exact same answer.\n\n\"They figured out who they were, and then they coached who they were rather than trying to be something that they're not,\" Sarkisian said. \"When adversity strikes, the real you comes out, and then everybody around you is like, 'Who the hell is that guy?'\"\n\nReflecting on his own coaching style, Sarkisian admitted that he felt like a thermometer, adjusting to the environment of each program instead of creating his own. Since arriving at Texas, Sarkisian has been able to take those memorable lessons from Saban and Carroll and make a culture that he's proud of.\n\n\"I've been fortunate to work for two amazing men in our sport that have been tremendous, and the life lessons I learned from them well beyond football that I've been able to apply, but apply in a way that fits me so there's a consistency to the approach that I give every day,\" Sarkisian said.\n\nWith plenty of knowledge and experience from his past successors, Sarkisian hopes to follow in their footsteps and rise to the occasion of being one of the newest members of the SEC.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_hutchinson@si.com", "name": "Emma Hutchinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Carroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klatt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Klatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS_National_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BCS National Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2880,h_1620,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/longhorns_country/01j0qcdkq6ay3w4yk1yv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669216", "eventUri": "eng-9669216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

During a conversation with FOX Sports' Joel Klatt, the Texas head coach revealed how his teams develop strong cultures.\n\n\"Culture is organic,\" Sarkisian said. \"It's not something that you list out in a team meeting. I think it naturally occurs. Every family dynamic has its own culture. I think that starts at the top. How are your parents? How were you raised? What is leadership?\n\n\"What is the example that we give to the culture that we want as coaches, that the players now can look to and say, 'Hey, that is something I want to emulate. That is somebody I want to be like. That is somebody I want to shape my life toward.'\"\n\nTexas' culture worked wonders last season. The Longhorns finished the 2024 campaign with a 12-2 overall record and an 8-1 mark in conference play. Led by Sarkisian, the program won the Big 12 for the first time since 2009 and made its first ever appearance in the College Football Playoff.\n\nWith numerous returning pieces, including starting quarterback Quinn Ewers, Texas hopes to reach even greater heights in the upcoming season. Sarkisian knows how vital culture is to the program's success.\n\n\"I was telling the group last year at the end of the year -- not only did they buy into our idea of the culture, I felt like the leaders on that team last year, elevated it,\" Sarkisian said. \"We went to another space that I didn't know a college football team could go.\n\n\"I think that's why you make those plays in games because guys count on one another because they had an opportunity to get vulnerable and get to know one another.\"\n\nSarkisian will need his players to make plenty of big plays in the upcoming season. The Longhorns' first season in the SEC will be a gauntlet, including matchups against Oklahoma and Georgia. Not to mention, Texas will face off against Michigan in Week 2.\n\nSarkisian is embracing the challenge.

All of it has made a stew that coaches must constantly tend to, a revolving door of responsibility that many have bemoaned. Not Sarkisian.\n\n\"Sometimes I hear other coaches complaining about different things in their program,\" Steve Sarkisian said on The Joel Klatt Show. \"We don't really deal with that as much, because I think it's who we are on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe Texas coach has built his program around sustainable methods of keeping up with each of those challenging new circumstances in the sport.\n\nThe Longhorns proved the model works last season, reaching the College Football Playoff for the first time in the program's history. Texas hopes it's just the first of many appearances, particularly with the playoff set to expand to 12 teams.\n\nSteve Sarkisian explained how it happened.\n\n\"It all comes back to our culture,\" he said. \"Of all the stuff that's happening, how good can our culture be in this building, right, whether it's the players, whether it's the support staff, whether it's the coaching staff, whether it's the administration.\n\n\"Is everybody on the same accord, is everybody talking the same language, is everybody working together, do we have a healthy environment that people want to come in here every day or do they have to come here every day?

Coaches are moving around the country now too more than ever, so how do we create an environment where people want to be here every day and are striving for a common goal and are committed to this thing collectively, and in turn through team success now come the individual accolades, awards, honors and draft picks and things of that nature.\"\n\nTexas will put its culture to the test again this fall, looking to repeat as a College Football Playoff contender.\n\nSteve Sarkisian doesn't want anything to change. He's built the consistency into the program, even with the aforementioned challenges the sport has sprung up over the last few years.\n\n\"So naturally over time that we've been here it's like what is the one thing that we can control?\" Sarkisian said. \"All this other stuff is happening, and we have to adapt.

Heading into the program's last year in the Big 12 Conference, the Longhorns started with a No. 11 ranking. After a stunning victory over No. 3 Alabama in week two, the team moved up to No. 4.\n\nSarkisian's Longhorns ended the regular season with only one loss in a thrilling Red River Showdown against Alabama and were ranked No. 3 with a spot in the College Football Playoffs after defeating Oklahoma State in the conference tournament. Texas fell to Washington in the semifinals 37-31.\n\nWhen Chris Del Conte, Jay Hartzell, and Chairman Eltife offered him the job, he had to reflect on what he was signing up for. The expectations others had for him? He had it much higher for himself.\n\n\"Once you kind of come to that realization that you know what you're signing up for and you understand what the expectations are - why am I taking this job? Is it just to be a head coach again? Or is it to strive to be a champion? Then can you do it again and again and again?\"\n\nGoing into the Southeastern Conference, there is a massive target in Texas and Sarkisian's back. But for the head coach, he has the best job in college football.\n\n\"Do what you love, love what you do,\" Sarkisian said. \"This is the greatest job in America. I get to come into this building every single day. I get to try to serve others as best I can, to try to lift them up to be the best that they can be.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AP poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Del_Conte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Del Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Hartzell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Hartzell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_Showdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red River Showdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_145/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/longhorns_country/01j0p43f4nhemn6zxrph.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669216", "eventUri": "eng-9669216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Recruiting was one of them. More specifically, how money factors into recruiting.\n\nSarkisian -- with a straight face -- said that \"NIL should be the last reason why you choose to go to a school.\" And to be fair, he's right. That is the correct outlook on the recruiting process. High school athletes should pick their college program based on system, fit, playing time, coaching staff, and tangible on-field performance metrics. The opportunity to get paid at the right school is an added bonus.\n\nHowever, Sarkisian went on to say that Texas takes a different approach to recruiting.

Which has become the most demanding month of the year for coaches as they manage postseason play and recruiting at the high school and college levels with the transfer portal.\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was in the eye of the storm last December, recently sitting down with Joel Klatt where he discussed the challenges that come in the final month of the calendar year.\n\n\"That was the hardest month of the year for me last year,\" Sarkisian said about December. \"You gotta think about we played in the Big 12 Championship game, we qualified for the CFP, we're playing in the Sugar Bowl against Washington, we were signing a really good high school class or top three, top four high school class, and we thought we might have some portal needs. We weren't quite sure, so you have to start to recruit these kids as they go into the portal and that was extremely challenging because as an offensive head coach and the play caller, I want to game plan.\"\n\nPlaying in December is always a good thing for coaches, meaning that you're participating in postseason play through a conference title game or a bowl. But when that's added onto signing a high school recruiting class and the winter transfer portal window opening up, responsibilities can pile up fast for head coaches.\n\n\"That month was really difficult and quite frankly a little out of control. I'm hopeful moving forward that we can get the timing of this a little bit better,\" Sarkisian said. \"I've been a proponent all along of moving signing day up to that first Wednesday prior to the conference championship game so all of your high school kids can sign. That gets put to bed and then the portal can open that Monday after that conference championship weekend. And then what I would what I would say, you can't enter the portal as long as your team is still in the College Football Playoff.\"\n\nSarkisian's vision of splitting up the responsibility for coaches in the calendar along with making some changes to the rules of the transfer portal could likely be something that most coaches would get behind. As they too are looking for things to be made easier in December one way or another during changes times in college football.\n\n\"I think this too, I think our game is at an all time high. The publicity, the exposure, the conversations, I think our weekly games are fantastic. They mean something, they matter,\" Sarkisian added. \"We're not perfect, that's okay, nothing's perfect. We just gotta keep trying to chop wood and move it in a positive direction. That hopefully over time, everybody can feel comfortable with this new era of college football. It's new. There's nothing wrong with new, change is inevitable. We're changing, that's okay. Let's just change it in a positive way.\"\n\nDespite the added responsibilities to the job, and likely stress, Sarkisian is still clearly hopeful for the future of college football. Which hopefully can make the proper changes in the future as coaches continue to juggle game plans, high school signing classes, inevitable coaching staff turnover, and transfer portal recruiting in the hectic month of December.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaiden_smith@on3.com", "name": "Kaiden Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klatt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Klatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Football_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Football Championship Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/19104141/Steve-Sarkisian-1-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669216", "eventUri": "eng-9669216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

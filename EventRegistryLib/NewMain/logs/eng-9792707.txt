Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the US and the UK denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both neighboring India and China. But relations with United States and other Western nations have been strained over lost civic freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.

But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents.

Yunus faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during Hasina's rule. He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nHasina resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.

But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government.

Bangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon.\n\nYunus, who called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\" faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during the former prime minister's rule. He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nHasina resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence. Jubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence. Some even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo.

He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nHasina resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence. Jubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence. Some even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nOn Tuesday, the operations at Dhaka's main Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport resumed after eight hours of suspension.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, a total of 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.\n\nIt said the jailbreak took place on Monday evening amid chaos gripping the country, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. At least three other TV stations were attacked.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both neighboring India and China. But relations with United States and other Western nations have been strained over lost civic freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMore than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader of Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood.\n\nMilitary chief General Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late on Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party urged people on Tuesday to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path\".\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the United Nations human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis\".\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party.\n\nBut amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 War of Independence, and which had fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nNearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. However, it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the US and the UK denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both neighbouring India and China. But relations with the US and other Western nations have been strained over lost civic freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work\".", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe unrest has resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. Fears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina's party.\n\nAuthorities also shut off mobile internet on Sunday, and

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the densely populated nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 41 people dead and about 200 others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen was reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nPeople shout slogans as they take part in a protest against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government demanding justice for the victims killed in the recent countrywide deadly clashes, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would launch an investigation into a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 policemen, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nNahid Islam, a top student coordinator, told reporters late Monday that the movement would propose an outline for the new interim government -- and they would not accept any other solution.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and the country's two leading, pro-government TV stations -- both of which were forced to go off air.\n\nElsewhere, protests were peaceful, and thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country's figurehead president met.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media. It was not clear where she would go next.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with United States and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged a peaceful transition, according to a statement from U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, calling for \"a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, speaking to reporters in Washington, welcomed the announcement that an interim government would be formed and called for \"calm and restraint in the days ahead.\"\n\nAli Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics who teaches political science at Illinois State University, said the country now faces an immense political challenge, as politicians and the military will struggle to restore calm while satisfying various camps and reining in attempts to settle scores.\n\n\"So the challenges on the process going forward are daunting,\" he said, adding that observers will be watching to ensure that the military's role stays that of mediator, given the history of army takeovers.\n\nProtests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system -- which set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan -- must be drastically cut.\n\nThe debate has highlighted the fact that there's a lack of quality jobs for college graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe unrest has resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. Fears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina's party.\n\nAuthorities also shut off mobile internet on Sunday, and broadband internet was cut briefly Monday but services were restored later in the day.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus was their choice as head of an interim government a day after the longtime Prime Minister Sheik Hasina resigned. The country's figurehead president and the military chief said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon. Nahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country. Yunus faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during Hasina's rule. He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance. Islam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices. Hasina resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. Her departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.

More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore. More violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, at least 25 people died, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood. The military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections. Speaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\u009d \"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\"\u009d Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings. \"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.

They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. Hasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom. The 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents.

Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military.

They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media.

Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both neighboring India and China. But relations with United States and other Western nations have been strained over lost civic freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak.

This comes a day after the military took control as mass demonstrations forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country.\n\nA key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests Tuesday called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to be named as the head of a new interim government, a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country after weeks of deadly unrest.\n\nNahid Islam, the organizer, in a video post in social media said the student protest leaders have already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country. Bangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said Monday that an interim government would be formed soon.\n\nYunus, who called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\" faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during the former prime minister's rule. He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nHasina resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nRead moreIron lady Sheikh Hasina ends 15-year rule and flees Bangladesh\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence. Jubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence. Some even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nOn Tuesday, the operations at Dhaka's main Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport resumed after eight hours of suspension.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore, while at least 25 people died amid violence in Savar, just outside Dhaka, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, a total of 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.\n\nIt said the jailbreak took place on Monday evening amid chaos gripping the country, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zaman and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\n'Transitional moment'\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nations human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. At least three other TV stations were attacked.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both neighboring India and China. But relations with United States and other Western nations have been strained over lost civic freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nMs Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.\n\nThousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer on Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nJubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence.\n\nSome even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMore than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Ms Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nMore violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, left at least 25 people died, the reports said.\n\nAnother 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood.\n\nThe military chief, General Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late on Monday after meeting with General Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, General Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nExperts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Ms Hasina's resignation.\n\nBut some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party.\n\nBut amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Ms Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nGeneral Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nNearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off the air.

The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told

But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. At least three other TV stations were attacked.\n\nMore than a dozen people were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a senior member of Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore, while at least 25 people died amid violence in Savar, just outside Dhaka, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com",

Demonstrators have demanded the end of quotas of government jobs to select members of society since July. Violent clashes with law enforcement have resulted in hundreds dead and Hasina fleeing the country after stepping down.\n\nBangladesh's prime minister resigned and fled the country on Monday, after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.\n\nThousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the capital's main airport suspended operations.\n\nAfter the embattled leader was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. He said he met with opposition politicians and civil society leaders and would seek the president's guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHe promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fuelled outrage against the government. He added that he ordered security forces not to fire on crowds.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" Waker-uz-Zaman said.\n\nBut even after he spoke, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, taking furniture and pulling raw fish from the refrigerators.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father was assassinated in 1975, as well as the house of the country's chief justice and Hasina's previous personal home in Dhaka, the capital. They torched two major offices of the ruling party.\n\nElsewhere, protests were peaceful, and thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country's figurehead president met.\n\nPM left country for her own safety, family says\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media. It was not clear where she would go next.\n\nShe left the country for her own safety at the insistence of her family, her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC World Service.\n\nHasina was \"so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her,\" Joy said, adding she would not attempt to mount a political comeback.\n\nThe protests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party, but the demonstrations then morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina and the party.\n\nThe 76-year-old -- who was the longest-serving female head of government -- was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the United States and Britain denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with the U.S. and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak.\n\nCountry's challenges 'are daunting'\n\nAli Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics and professor of political science at Illinois State University, said the country is facing a long road ahead, as politicians and the military will struggle to restore calm while satisfying various camps and reining in attempts to settle scores.\n\n\"So the challenges on the process going forward are daunting,\" he said, adding that observers will be watching to ensure that the military's role stays that of mediator, given the history of army takeovers.\n\nThe protests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system -- which set aside up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan -- must be drastically cut.\n\nThe government attempted to quell the demonstrations with force, leaving nearly 300 people dead since mid-July.\n\nAt least 95 people, including at least 14 police officers, died in clashes in the capital on Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. Hundreds more were injured.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. The unrest has also resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew.\n\nAuthorities also shut off mobile internet service on Sunday in an attempt to quell the unrest, and broadband internet was cut briefly on Monday, but services were restored later in the day.\n\nOver the weekend, protesters called for a \"non-co-operation\" effort, urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills and not to show up for work on Sunday, a working day in Bangladesh. Offices, banks and factories opened, but commuters in Dhaka and other cities struggled to get to their jobs since much public transport was halted amid fears of violence.\n\nHasina offered to talk with student leaders on Saturday, but a co-ordinator refused and demanded her resignation.\n\nShe repeated her pledges to investigate the deaths and punish those responsible for the violence.

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)\n\nBangladesh's prime minister resigned and fled the country Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the densely populated nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 41 people dead and about 200 others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. More than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. Experts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would launch an investigation into a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fueled outrage against the government. Nearly 100 people, including 14 policemen, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nNahid Islam, a top student coordinator, told reporters late Monday that the movement would propose an outline for the new interim government -- and they would not accept any other solution.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and the country's two leading, pro-government TV stations -- both of which were forced to go off air.\n\nElsewhere, protests were peaceful, and thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country's figurehead president met.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media. It was not clear where she would go next.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with United States and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged a peaceful transition, according to a statement from U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, calling for \"a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, speaking to reporters in Washington, welcomed the announcement that an interim government would be formed and called for \"calm and restraint in the days ahead.\"\n\nAli Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics who teaches political science at Illinois State University, said the country now faces an immense political challenge, as politicians and the military will struggle to restore calm while satisfying various camps and reining in attempts to settle scores.\n\n\"So the challenges on the process going forward are daunting,\" he said, adding that observers will be watching to ensure that the military's role stays that of mediator, given the history of army takeovers.\n\nProtests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system -- which set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan -- must be drastically cut.\n\nThe debate has highlighted the fact that there's a lack of quality jobs for college graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe unrest has resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. Fears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina's party.\n\nAuthorities also shut off mobile internet on Sunday, and broadband internet was cut briefly Monday but services were restored later in the day.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The government attempted to quell demonstrations by shutting schools, imposing curfews and sending in troops to shoot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, leading to some 300 deaths, but those heavy-handed tactics only drove further discontent.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nMilitary chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said Monday he was temporarily taking control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, said after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nYunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\" He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nA longtime opponent of the ousted leader, he was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengeance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending.\n\nStudent organizer Nahid Islam said the protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nAmid celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day: \"Today we are getting what we deserve,\" she said. \"Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful.\"\n\nJubilant protesters still thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with the soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nBut the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 War of Independence. Many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nViolence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported.

toppled PM want Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead Bangladesh", "body": "A protest organiser said they had already spoken with Mr Yunus, who had consented to take over as head of a new interim government.\n\nA key organiser of Bangladesh's student protests has called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to be named as the head of a new interim government, a day after long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country after weeks of deadly unrest.\n\nNahid Islam, the organiser, in a video post on social media said the student protest leaders have already talked with Mr Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said on Monday that an interim government would be formed soon.\n\nMr Yunus, who called Ms Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\" faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during the former prime minister's rule.\n\nHe received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nMs Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.\n\nThousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer on Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nJubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence.\n\nSome even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMore than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Ms Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nMore violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, left at least 25 people died, the reports said.\n\nAnother 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood.\n\nThe military chief, General Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late on Monday after meeting with General Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, General Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nExperts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Ms Hasina's resignation.\n\nBut some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party.\n\nBut amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Ms Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nGeneral Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nNearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType":

Zia, a longtime rival of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was convicted on corruption charges by Hasina's government in 2018.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence as jubilant protesters thronged the ousted leader's residence. Some posed for selfies with soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nAs the country waited for a new government to emerge, a key student leader said protesters wanted Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government.\n\nYunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\" He could not immediately be reached for comment, but student leader Nahid Islam said Yunus had agreed.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nHasina fled to India by helicopter on Monday as protesters defied military curfew orders to march on the capital, with thousands of demonstrators eventually storming her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. Protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to her party grew into broader challenge to her 15-year rule in recent weeks.\n\nA crackdown on the demonstrations led to clashes that left scores dead - and only fueled the movement.\n\nMilitary chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was taking temporary control of the country after Hasina resigned, and he and the country's figurehead president promised an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, protest leader Sarjis Alam told reporters that they had asked the president to dissolve Parliament by 3:00 p.m., and threatened to renew demonstrations otherwise as they seek to \"repair the state.\"\n\n\"We have proposed the name of Muhammad Yunus with his consent, now if someone else comes from among the MPs, we will not allow that to happen,\" he said.\n\nA longtime opponent of the ousted leader, Yunus was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending.\n\nIslam, the organizer, said protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nAmid celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day: \"Today we are getting what we deserve,\" she said. \"Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful.\"\n\nBut the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence. Many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nViolence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents.

The government attempted to quell demonstrations by shutting schools, imposing curfews and sending in troops to shoot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, leading to some 300 deaths, but those heavy-handed tactics only drove further discontent.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nYunus, who is in Paris according to Indian media, told student leaders he would be willing to serve, considering the present situation of the country, organizer Nahid Islam said in a video posted to social media.\n\nYunus, who called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\" is a longtime opponent of the ousted leader. During her administration, the government accused him of corruption and put him on trial on charges he said were motivated by vengance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nMilitary chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said Monday he was temporarily taking control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, said after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the Hasina was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nJubilant protesters still thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with the soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nBut many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence.\n\nViolence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. At least three other TV stations were attacked.\n\nMore than a dozen people were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a senior member of Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore, while at least 25 people died amid violence in Savar, just outside Dhaka, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com",

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests Tuesday called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government, a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following weeks of deadly unrest. Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter as protesters defied military curfew orders to march on the capital, before thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. Her depature came after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into deadly violence, fuelling a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. The government attempted to quell demonstrations by shutting schools, imposing curfews and sending in troops to shoot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, leading to some 300 deaths, but those heavy-handed tactics only drove further discontent. Bangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections. Yunus, who is in Paris according to Indian media, told student leaders he would be willing to serve, considering the present situation of the country, organizer Nahid Islam said in a video posted to social media. Yunus, who called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\"\u009d is a longtime opponent of the ousted leader. During her administration, the government accused him of corruption and put him on trial on charges he said were motivated by vengance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending. Islam said the student protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes. Military chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said Monday he was temporarily taking control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, said after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections. Speaking after the Hasina was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored. The streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence. Jubilant protesters still thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with the soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens. But many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours. On Tuesday, the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence. Violence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings. \"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\"\u009d declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka. Crowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - the country's first president and independence leader - was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air. At least three other TV stations were attacked. More than a dozen people were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a senior member of Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore, while at least 25 people died amid violence in Savar, just outside Dhaka, the reports said. Another 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighborhood. In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country. Police in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\u009d \"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\"\u009d Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X. In a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00c3\u00bcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\"\u009d and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\u009d Hasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom. The 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it. Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"\u009d",

talked with Mr Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said on Monday that an interim government would be formed soon.\n\nMr Yunus, who called Ms Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day,\" faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during the former prime minister's rule.\n\nHe received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nMs Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.\n\nThousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer on Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nJubilant protesters were still thronging the ousted leader's residence.\n\nSome even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMore than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Ms Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nMore violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, left at least 25 people died, the reports said.\n\nAnother 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood.\n\nThe military chief, General Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late on Monday after meeting with General Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nSpeaking after the embattled leader was seen in television footage boarding a military helicopter with her sister, General Waker-uz-Zaman sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored.\n\nExperts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Ms Hasina's resignation.\n\nBut some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party.\n\nBut amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Ms Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nGeneral Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nNearly 100 people, including 14 police officers, were killed Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk",

Thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the densely populated nation on India's border that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption and climate change. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late Monday after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nAfter the embattled leader was seen on TV with her sister boarding a military helicopter, the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, sought to reassure a jittery nation that order would be restored -- though experts warned the road ahead would be long. He said he had met with opposition politicians and civil society leaders and would seek the president's guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Hasina's resignation. But the celebrations soon turned violent in places, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favored those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party. But amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nWaker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would launch an investigation into the crackdown that led to some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence and fueled outrage against the government. He added that he ordered security forces not to fire on crowds.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. But it was not clear if Hasina's resignation or the military chief's calls for calm would be enough to end the turmoil.\n\nNahid Islam, a top student coordinator, told reporters late Monday that the movement would propose an outline for the new interim government -- and they would not accept any other solution.\n\nThroughout the day, people continued to pour into and out of Hasina's official residence, where they set fires, carried out furniture and pulled raw fish from the refrigerators. They also massed outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the country's first president and independence leader -- was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and the country's two leading, pro-government TV stations -- both of which were forced to go off air.\n\nElsewhere, protests were peaceful, and thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country's figurehead president met.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed in a city in India on the border with Bangladesh, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media. It was not clear where she would go next.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with United States and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak. In total, she served more than 20 years, longer than any other female head of government.\n\nAli Riaz, an expert on Bangladeshi politics who teaches political science at Illinois State University, said the country is facing a long road ahead, as politicians and the military will struggle to restore calm while satisfying various camps and reining in attempts to settle scores.\n\n\"So the challenges on the process going forward are daunting,\" he said, adding that observers will be watching to ensure that the military's role stays that of mediator, given the history of army takeovers.\n\nProtests have continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system -- which set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan -- must be drastically cut.\n\nThe debate has highlighted the fact that there's a lack of quality jobs for college graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs. But there aren't enough to go around -- each year, some 400,000 graduates compete for around 3,000 jobs in the civil service exam.\n\nThe government attempted to quell the demonstrations with force -- leaving nearly 300 people dead since mid-July -- and that only seemed to fuel them.\n\nAt least 95 people, including at least 14 police officers, died in clashes in the capital on Sunday, according to the country's leading Bengali-language daily newspaper, Prothom Alo. Hundreds more were injured. At least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.\n\nThe unrest has resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew. Fears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina's party.\n\nAuthorities also shut off mobile internet on Sunday, and broadband internet was cut briefly Monday but services were restored later in the day.\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, told the BBC that he doubted his mother would make a political comeback, as she has in the past, saying she was \"so disappointed after all her hard work.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [],

who toppled PM want Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead Bangladesh", "body": "A key organiser of Bangladesh's student protests has called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to be named as the head of a new interim government, a day after long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country after weeks of deadly unrest.\n\nNahid Islam, the organiser, in a video post on social media said the student protest leaders have already talked with Mr Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said on Monday that an interim government would be formed soon.\n\nHe received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance.\n\nIslam said the student protesters would announce more names for the government, and it would be a difficult challenge for the current leadership to ignore their choices.\n\nMs Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into violence and grew into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule.\n\nThousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure threatened to create even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation that is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer on Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nSome even took selfies with the soldiers guarding the building, where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings and even the former prime minister's flower pots and chickens.\n\nViolence just before and after her resignation left at least 109 people dead and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMore than a dozen were reportedly killed when protesters set fire to a hotel owned by a leader in Ms Hasina's party in the southwestern town of Jashore.\n\nMore violence at Savar, just outside Dhaka, left at least 25 people died, the reports said.\n\nAnother 10 people died in Dhaka's Uttara neighbourhood.\n\nThe military chief, General Waker-uz-Zamam said he was temporarily taking control of the country, and soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced late on Monday after meeting with General Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nExperts, though, warned the road ahead would be long.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people poured into the streets waving flags and cheering to celebrate Ms Hasina's resignation.\n\nBut some celebrations soon turned violent, with protesters attacking symbols of her government and party, ransacking and setting fires in several buildings.\n\n\"This is not just the end of the tyrant Sheikh Hasina, with this we put an end to the mafia state that she has created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester, on the streets of Dhaka.\n\nProtests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League party.\n\nBut amid a deadly crackdown, the demonstrations morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Ms Hasina, highlighting the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.\n\nGeneral Waker-uz-Zaman promised that the military would investigate a crackdown that had left nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence, and which had fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks.", "source":

(AP Photo/Rajib Dhar)DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Bangaldesh's president dissolved parliament Tuesday, clearing the way for new elections to replace the longtime prime minister who resigned and left the country after weeks of violent unrest. President Mohammed Shahabuddin's office announced the decision Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, a protest leader had threatened to return to the streets unless parliament was dissolved the same day. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests Tuesday called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government, a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following weeks of deadly unrest. Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter as protesters defied military curfew orders to march on the capital, before thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. Her depature came after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into deadly violence, fuelling a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. The government attempted to quell demonstrations by shutting schools, imposing curfews and sending in troops to shoot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, leading to some 300 deaths, but those heavy-handed tactics only drove further discontent. Bangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections. Military chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said Monday he was temporarily taking control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971. Mohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, said after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections. Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\"\u009d He could not immediately be reached for comment. A longtime opponent of the ousted leader, he was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending. Student organizer Nahid Islam said the protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes. The streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence. Amid celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day: \"Today we are getting what we deserve,\"\u009d she said. \"Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful.\"\u009d Jubilant protesters still thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with the soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens. But the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence. Many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change. Violence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Amid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours. In the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country. Police in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\u009d \"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\"\u009d Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X. In a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00c3\u00bcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\"\u009d and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\u009d Hasina landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom. The 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.", "source": {"uri":

Earlier, a protest leader had threatened to return to the streets unless parliament was dissolved the same day.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- A key organizer of Bangladesh's student protests Tuesday called for Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government, a day after longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following weeks of deadly unrest.\n\nHasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter as protesters defied military curfew orders to march on the capital, before thousands of demonstrators stormed her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer depature came after weeks of protests against a quota system for government jobs descended into deadly violence, fuelling a broader challenge to her 15-year rule. The government attempted to quell demonstrations by shutting schools, imposing curfews and sending in troops to shoot tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition, leading to some 300 deaths, but those heavy-handed tactics only drove further discontent.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nMilitary chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam said Monday he was temporarily taking control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, said after meeting with Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nYunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\" He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nA longtime opponent of the ousted leader, he was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengance. He received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending.\n\nStudent organizer Nahid Islam said the protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence.\n\nAmid celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day: \"Today we are getting what we deserve,\" she said. \"Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful.\"\n\nJubilant protesters still thronged the ousted leader's residence, some posing for selfies with the soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nBut the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence. Many fear that Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nViolence just before and after Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalized.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path.\"\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the United Nation's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis.\"\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported. The report said Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the polls, and the U.S. and the U.K. denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nJulhas Alam, The Associated Press",

residence.\n\nSome posed for selfies with soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nAs the country waited for a new government to emerge, a key student leader said protesters wanted Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government.\n\nMr Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Sheikh Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day\".\n\nHe could not immediately be reached for comment, but student leader Nahid Islam said Mr Yunus had agreed.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late on Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's 15 years in power ended with the leader and her sister boarding a helicopter for India, as thousands of protesters defied military curfew orders to march on her residence, which they later sacked along with buildings associated with her party and family.\n\nHer departure came after protests against a quota system for government jobs grew into broader challenge to her 15-year rule as scores were killed in clashes between protesters, security forces and pro-government activists.\n\nMilitary chief General Waker-uz-Zamam said earlier he was taking temporary control of the country, as soldiers tried to stem unrest.\n\nThe military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, protest leader Sarjis Alam told reporters that they had asked the president to dissolve Parliament by 3pm, and threatened to renew demonstrations otherwise as they seek to \"repair the state\".\n\n\"We have proposed the name of Muhammad Yunus with his consent, now if someone else comes from among the MPs, we will not allow that to happen,\" he said.\n\nA long-time opponent of the ousted leader, Mr Yunus was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengeance.\n\nHe received the Nobel in 2006 for work pioneering microlending.\n\nMr Islam, the organiser, said protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nAmid celebrations, student Juairia Karim said it was a historic day.\n\n\"Today we are getting what we deserve,\" she said. \"Everyone is happy, everyone is cheerful.\"\n\nBut the country was still counting the toll of weeks of violent unrest that produced some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence.\n\nMany fear that Ms Hasina's departure could lead to even more instability in the densely populated South Asian nation, which is already dealing with crises from high unemployment to corruption to climate change.\n\nViolence just before and after Ms Hasina's resignation left at least 109 people dead, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nAmid security concerns, the main airport in Dhaka, the capital, suspended operations for eight hours.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nPolice in Dhaka mostly left their stations and assembled in a central barracks in fear of attacks after several stations were torched or vandalised.\n\nMs Hasina landed at a military airfield near New Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka and met India's national security adviser Ajit Doval, the Indian Express newspaper reported.\n\nThe report said Ms Hasina was taken to a safe house and is likely to travel to the UK.\n\nThe 76-year-old was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote

They say it is the best day for our lifetime,\" said Abdul Baten, acting president of the Canada-Bangladesh Association of Manitoba.\n\nBaten said the news sparked an impromptu gathering in the early hours of Monday morning in a Winnipeg park, where some cried tears of joy after many sleepless nights over a deadly crackdown on the peaceful student protests.\n\n\"And all these things happened just because of our student community,\" he said. \"We used to say that this generation ... they do the Facebook and all other things. But this generation, they learn from each other, they share the information.\"\n\nProtests from frustrated students demanding an end to a system they said favoured those with connections to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party began peacefully last month, but later morphed into an unprecedented challenge to the party and Hasina's 15-year rule.\n\nAttempts to quell the demonstrations with force, leaving nearly 300 people dead since mid-July, also fuelled outrage against the government.\n\nThe protests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system -- which set aside up to 30 per cent of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan -- must be drastically cut.\n\nIn parts of Bangladesh, thousands of demonstrators stormed Hasina's official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family. But in other areas, protests were peaceful, with thousands gathered Monday evening outside the presidential palace, where the military chief, opposition politicians and the country's figurehead president met.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father was assassinated in 1975, as well as the house of the country's chief justice and Hasina's previous personal home in Dhaka, the capital. They torched two major offices of the ruling party.\n\nFears also rose among Hindus that they might be targeted in the unrest since they are generally thought to be supporters of Hasina's party.\n\nIt's a fear shared by Sutirtha Saha, whose Hindu family still lives in Bangladesh.\n\n\"People basically in Bangladesh associate Hindu people with the ... former party,\" he said. \"It has always been like this, it's always synonymous with Hindus being pro-Awami League ruling party and pro-India.\n\n\"This is what people think,\" said Saha. \"Sometimes they consider us as outsiders, they think we are more Indians than Bangladeshi, which is not true. Our language is Bengali, we were born there and we have been brought up there and I don't know why people would assume otherwise.\"\n\nSaha said his parents live in a part of Bangladesh where it's known that some Hindu families live. He said he watched earlier in the day on security camera footage as his family's home in the country was attacked earlier in the day.\n\nHe also said he's been monitoring that camera just in case something happened while his parents were asleep.\n\n\"I felt helpless, powerless, just concerned about how my family would be,\" he said. \"I have been in contact with them ... for the past couple of hours I've been calling them every few minutes, the whole day I've been watching my phone looking at the CCTV camera.\"\n\nBaten said he appreciates the support he's seen in Canada for the protesters and was joined by hundreds of community members as they gathered to celebrate the news Monday afternoon at Kirkbridge Park in south Winnipeg.\n\n\"We are very happy -- very, very happy,\" he said. \"And we hope for the best for Bangladesh.\"\n\nAnd Ashraful Alam, who attended the gathering, said he wants those celebrating Hasina's resignation back home to do so calmly and peacefully.\n\n\"The first thing is that it is achieved, but now we have to be united back again and rebuild the country,\" he said.\n\nAlam said while the gathering a celebration, it was also the chance to spread a message of unity.\n\n\"It's a country with many races and many people of different faith,\" he said. \"We want to live in harmony with all of them.\"\n\nMore than a hundred students from University of Manitoba Bangladeshi Students' Association (UMBSA) had also gathered in mid-July to show their support for the protesters in Bangladesh and to voice criticism's of the country's leadership.\n\nHasina, 76, was the country's longest-serving female head of government. She was elected for a fourth consecutive term in a January vote that was boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed in the lead-up to the polls, and the United States and Britain denounced the result as not credible, though the government defended it.\n\nHasina had cultivated ties with powerful countries, including both India and China. But under her, relations with the U.S. and other Western nations have come under strain, as they have expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people.\n\nHer political opponents have previously accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and have blamed the unrest on that authoritarian streak.\n\nThe prime minister's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change. Amid security concerns, the capital's main airport suspended operations.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Zia, a longtime rival of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was convicted on corruption charges by Hasina's government in 2018.\n\nThe streets of Dhaka appeared calmer Tuesday, with no reports of new violence as jubilant protesters thronged the ousted leader's residence. Some posed for selfies with soldiers guarding the building where a day earlier angry protesters had looted furniture, paintings, flower pots and chickens.\n\nAs the country waited for a new government to emerge, a key student leader said protesters wanted Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head an interim government.\n\nYunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, called Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\" He could not immediately be reached for comment, but student leader Nahid Islam said Yunus had agreed.\n\nBangladesh's figurehead president and its top military commander said late Monday that an interim government would be formed soon to preside over new elections.\n\nHasina fled to India by helicopter on Monday as protesters defied military curfew orders to march on the capital, with thousands of demonstrators eventually storming her official residence and other buildings associated with her party and family.

The United States stands with the people of Bangladesh. We urge all parties to refrain from further violence. Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch Asia Deputy Director Meenakshi Ganguly said, \"What we do want to see most immediately is a non-partisan investigative system that looks into all the violence that has occurred and prosecute those responsible, irrespective of which side they belong to, that there is law and order, which means that there is no engagement in exacting revenge.\"\n\nPrime Minister Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border which is already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.

Why did they hit the streets and what happens now?", "body": "Inside Bangladesh it's being dubbed a Gen Z revolution - a protest movement that pitted mostly young student demonstrators against a 76-year-old leader who had dominated her nation for decades and turned increasingly authoritarian in recent years.\n\nThere was jubilation on the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Monday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter following weeks of deadly anti-government unrest.\n\nHasina's abrupt exit ends 15 years in power that has been marked by a stifling of civil freedoms and the heavy-handed use of security forces to crush dissent, critics and rights groups say.\n\nIn a national address, Bangladesh's army chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said the military would form an interim government, but student protest leaders have called for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead a temporary administration.\n\nLater on Tuesday, a source at the Yunus Centre think tank in Dhaka confirmed to CNN that its founder had agreed to return to Bangladesh to fulfil the protesters' request for him to serve as head of the interim government, while the country's main opposition party offered its full support to student protesters.\n\nWhat began as peaceful protests by students against civil service job quotas morphed into a nationwide push to force Hasina out after demonstrators were met with a government crackdown that killed about 300 people, according to local media and agencies.\n\nHasina blamed the opposition for the violence and imposed internet blocks and an indefinite curfew across the country.\n\nHer response inflamed the protesters further and, in the end, the world's longest-serving female head of government had to quickly flee the country with her sister to India before crowds stormed her official residence, smashing walls and looting its contents.\n\nStudents began protesting on July 1 at the prestigious Dhaka University demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves 30% of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles were linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters said the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nDriving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nThe protests turned violent on July 15 and the government's increasingly deadly response fueled their anger further, even after the Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs and internet blocks were lifted.\n\nOn Sunday, at least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes between police and protesters, the highest for a single day from any protests in the country's recent history.\n\nAfter Hasina's resignation on Monday, celebration soon gave way to more violence as protesters torched several buildings, including the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum - the ancestral residence of Hasina's father Mujibur Rahman - and Awami League offices, eyewitnesses told CNN.\n\n\"Things turned ugly really quickly,\" said Raiyan Aftab, 23, a student at BRAC University, who said police shot at protesters outside the campus. \"They shot everybody. There is blood in front of my university right now. There's like 30 bodies... I couldn't sleep all night.\"\n\nAcross the capital, anti-government protesters were attacked by police and military personnel, witnesses said. At Dhaka Medical College, police opened fire on protesters, according to a CNN fixer at the scene.\n\nStudents and protesters at Dhaka University Campus and the Shaheed Minar, a national monument in the capital, were beaten by police as they assembled at these locations.\n\n\"I went to Shaheed Minar with my friends to celebrate. It was epic. There's like thousands of people there, everybody went, regardless of class, heritage, religion, we're all together and all the students met up with flags and everything. It was a historic moment,\" said Aftab. \"But it was short lived.\"\n\nMeanwhile, images appeared online of young people guarding Hindu temples as misinformation swirled online and a mob attacked a temple, according to the director of the Meherpur ISKCON temple.\n\nThe demonstrations became the ultimate challenge to Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced the release of opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia - a longtime Hasina rival - who had been jailed in 2018 on graft charges which she denies. Other student protesters and those arrested on \"false cases,\" were also released, the president said.\n\nHasina's political career spanned decades since returning from exile in the early 1980s following the assassination of her father and most of her family. In 1990 she led a popular democratic uprising against military rule and has survived several assassination attempts in the years since.\n\nShe first became prime minister in 1996 and served for one term before returning to power in 2008, ruling Bangladesh with her Awami League party until Monday.\n\nHuman rights organizations have warned that Hasina and her government were headed toward a one-party system, and critics expressed concerns over increased reports of political violence, voter intimidation, and harassment of the media and opposition figures.\n\nDuring her time in power, rights groups say the government has used its cyber security law to crack down on freedom of expression online, arresting journalists, artists and activists, with reported cases of arbitrary detention and torture.\n\nBut Hasina had managed to weather many previous protests against her rule that erupted particularly during elections, so her resignation after five weeks of unrest was seen as sudden and unexpected.\n\nYoung people, who witnessed their peers shot and killed, fueled by dismal job prospects and who were tired of corruption and repression, could not be stopped by curfews, internet blocks or security forces.\n\n\"This might very well be the first successful Gen Z led revolution,\" said Sabrina Karim, associate professor of government at Cornell University, who specializes in the study of political violence.\n\nThe military may have also played a role in Hasina's resignation. Karim said in a statement that it \"appears that the military were not always a unified force backing the Hasina regime.\"\n\n\"While there are many photos and videos circulating of soldiers using deadly force and shooting at unarmed protesters, some members of the military called for an independent UN-led investigation into these atrocities,\" she said. \"In addition, some members of the military announced yesterday that they would not use deadly force on protesters who convened on the capital.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Bangladesh awaited the formation of the interim government and protest organizers with the Students Against Discrimination said they will meet with Bangladesh's army chief.\n\nStudent leader Muhammad Nahid Islam said they hadn't met all of their goals, and after Hasina's resignation, the group wanted to \"abolish fascist systems forever.\" The leaders say they won't accept a military-led or supported government.\n\nThe protest group say the interim government should be led by Yunus, a social entrepreneur and banker who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering microfinance work that helped alleviate poverty in Bangladesh.\n\nYunus will soon return to Bangladesh with the intention to take up the post \"after a minor medical procedure in Paris,\" a source told CNN. The Students Against Discrimination group also confirmed his return, telling CNN in a text message: \"We are very delighted to say that Dr. Yunus has agreed to accept this challenge to save Bangladesh as per our student's request.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN Monday, Yunus said he wanted to see the army hand control of the country to a civilian government.\n\n\"People are celebrating on the street and millions and millions of people all over Bangladesh [are] celebrating as if this is our liberation day,\" he said.\n\nWhile Hasina's resignation was celebrated, some Bangladeshis expressed trepidation over the path ahead as the country attempts to fill a leadership vacuum.\n\n\"Hasina may be gone, but there is still a long road ahead for Bangladesh,\" student Faiza Chowdhury, 25, told CNN. \"Until our religious minorities and ethnic minorities are protected and justice comes to them too, the nation is not free.\"\n\nProtester Aftab was wary of the military holding on to power.\n\n\"We have to remember the last 15 years, the army didn't do anything. They protected this regime so they can't just come into power and become good guys. We know who they are and what they're going to do,\" he said.\n\nOthers were more optimistic. Another Bangladeshi studying in New York told CNN that \"Gen Z made everything possible. They are the future of Bangladesh and they can create a better future.\"\n\nTanbirul Miraj Ripon in Dhaka and CNN's Samra Zulfaqar, Isaac Yee, Bex Wright, Teele Rebane, Lucas Lilieholm, and Esha Mitra

The Prime Minister's resignation came as a consequence of the popular uprising sparked by protests led by young students since last July, opposing a law that established quotas for public administration jobs.\n\nThe protests continued even after the Supreme Court ruled last month that the quota system -- which reserved up to 30% of public jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in the country's independence war against Pakistan -- had to be drastically reduced, noted the American news agency AP. The police and paramilitary forces violently repressed the demonstrations, resulting in nearly 300 deaths since mid-July, including at least 95 fatalities -- 14 of whom were police officers -- just this Sunday in clashes in the capital, Dhaka, according to AP citing the leading Bengali newspaper Prothom Alo.\n\nHundreds of people were injured, and around 11,000 have been detained in recent weeks. However, the departure of the leader could usher in further instability in the predominantly Muslim nation of 170 million people, already grappling with high unemployment rates, corruption, and the impacts of climate change.\n\nHundreds of thousands took to the streets with flags and cheers to celebrate Hasina's resignation, but in some places, the jubilation turned to violence as citizens attacked symbols of her government and party, looted, and burned buildings. \"This is not just the end of tyrant Sheikh Hasina; we are putting an end to the mafia state she created,\" declared Sairaj Salekin, a student protester in Dhaka, to AP.\n\nCrowds stormed Hasina's official residence, setting fires, looting furniture and other items, and taking food from refrigerators. Hundreds gathered in front of the Parliament building, where they hung a banner reading \"justice.\"\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Army Commander General Waker-uz-Zaman announced that he would take over temporarily and seek advice from President Mohammed Shahabuddin to form an \"interim government.\" Later in the evening, after a meeting with the military chief and opposition politicians, President Shahabuddin announced that Parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to new elections.\n\nIn statements to the BBC, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of the former Prime Minister and one of her advisors, confirmed that Hasina would permanently retire from politics and defended her legacy. \"She is very disappointed that after all her hard work, a minority has risen against her,\" he said. \"When she took power, this country was considered a failed state. It was poor, and today it is seen as one of Asia's rising tigers.\"\n\nHasina was re-elected in January for a fourth consecutive term in elections boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the elections. The United States and the United Kingdom deemed the results not credible, despite the government's defenses.\n\nBangladesh's relations with the U.S. and other Western countries have been strained, as these nations have voiced concerns over human rights violations and press freedom in the Asian nation. Hasina's political rivals had previously accused her of becoming increasingly autocratic and endangering the country's democracy.", "source": {"uri": "cubaheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We will not accept any military government, military-backed government or any B-team government formed with the associates of the fascists,\" the student leaders warned.\n\nMr Yunus, 84, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 after he pioneered microlending. He faced a number of corruption accusations and a number of court cases under Ms Hasina's rule, which his supporters described as a politically motivated vendetta as he was seen as a potential rival.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, he was honoured with numerous prestigious awards such as the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. He has also worked as chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018.\n\nMr Yunus has called Ms Hasina's resignation the country's \"second liberation day\" and said Bangladesh was now a \"free country\" after her departure.\n\nMs Hasina's exit has plunged the country into political instability after 15 years of one-party rule. The South Asian nation is already grappling with a series of crises such as high unemployment, corruption, communal violence and climate change.\n\nOn Monday, at least 135 people were killed as thousands of people marched to Dhaka to demand the resignation of the prime minister. Widespread arson, vandalism and rioting continued in the country overnight, taking the total death toll during the protests to well over 400.\n\nAnalysts have said the road ahead in Bangladesh's future would be long as unrest continues.\n\n\"Will be hard to focus on an interim government and political transition as long as the unrest and mayhem are not reined in. This is where the role of the army becomes significant. Intervening has its own risks, but it's unclear who else can step in at this point,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, said.\n\nThe main opposition, Bangladesh Nationalist Party, on Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path\".\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chair, wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nGeneral Zaman said he was temporarily taking control of the country as soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nMr Shahabuddin announced late Monday after meeting with General Zamam and opposition politicians that parliament would be dissolved and a national government would be formed as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia.\n\nHe also announced that all detained protesters would be released.\n\nThe role of the military in the country's governance is yet to be seen. The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nAfter Ms Hasina's ouster, protesters stormed into her residence where they set fires, carried out furniture, and took away raw fish from the refrigerators. They also gathered outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Ms Hasina's family's ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - the country's first president and independence leader - was assassinated. They torched major offices of the ruling party and two pro-government TV stations, forcing both to go off air.\n\nMs Hasina had by then arrived in neighbouring India where she reportedly applied for political asylum in Britain and is still awaiting confirmation.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Why did they hit the streets and what happens now? | CNN", "body": "CNN --\n\nInside Bangladesh it's being dubbed a Gen Z revolution - a protest movement that pitted mostly young student demonstrators against a 76-year-old leader who had dominated her nation for decades and turned increasingly authoritarian in recent years.\n\nThere was jubilation on the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Monday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter following weeks of deadly anti-government unrest.\n\nHasina's abrupt exit ends 15 years in power that has been marked by a stifling of civil freedoms and the heavy-handed use of security forces to crush dissent, critics and rights groups say.\n\nIn a national address, Bangladesh's army chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said the military would form an interim government, but student protest leaders have called for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead a temporary administration.\n\nWhat began as initially peaceful protests by students against civil service job quotas morphed into a nationwide push to force Hasina out after demonstrators were met with a government crackdown that killed about 300 people, according to local media and agencies.\n\nHasina blamed the opposition for the violence and imposed internet blocks and an indefinite curfew across the country.\n\nHer response inflamed the protesters further and, in the end, the world's longest-serving female head of government had to quickly flee the country with her sister to India before crowds stormed her official residence, smashing walls and looting its contents.\n\nFires burn outside the Prime Minister's House after Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country, on August 5, 2024 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nParvez Ahmad Rony/Drik/Getty Images\n\nWhy were Bangladeshis on the streets?\n\nStudents began protesting on July 1 at the prestigious Dhaka University demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves 30% of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles were linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters said the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nDriving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nThe protests turned violent on July 15 and the government's increasingly deadly response fueled their anger further, even after the Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs and internet blocks were lifted.\n\nOn Sunday, at least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes between police and protesters, the highest for a single day from any protests in the country's recent history.\n\nProtesters shout slogans as they celebrate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation in Dhaka.\n\nRajib Dhar/AP\n\n'Blood in front of my university'\n\nAfter Hasina's resignation on Monday, celebration soon gave way to more violence as protesters torched several buildings, including the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum - the ancestral residence of Hasina's father Mujibur Rahman - and Awami League offices, eyewitnesses told CNN.\n\n\"Things turned ugly really quickly,\" said Raiyan Aftab, 23, a student at BRAC University, who said police shot at protesters outside the campus. \"They shot everybody. There is blood in front of my university right now. There's like 30 bodies... I couldn't sleep all night.\"\n\nAcross the capital, anti-government protesters were attacked by police and military personnel, witnesses said. At Dhaka Medical College, police opened fire on protesters, according to a CNN fixer at the scene.\n\nStudents and protesters at Dhaka University Campus and the Shaheed Minar, a national monument in the capital, were beaten by police as they assembled at these locations.\n\n\"I went to Shaheed Minar with my friends to celebrate. It was epic. There's like thousands of people there, everybody went, regardless of class, heritage, religion, we're all together and all the students met up with flags and everything.

Why did they hit the streets and what happens now? - KION546", "body": "(CNN) -- Inside Bangladesh it's being dubbed a Gen Z revolution - a protest movement that pitted mostly young student demonstrators against a 76-year-old leader who had dominated her nation for decades and turned increasingly authoritarian in recent years.\n\nThere was jubilation on the streets of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Monday after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country by helicopter following weeks of deadly anti-government unrest.\n\nHasina's abrupt exit ends 15 years in power that has been marked by a stifling of civil freedoms and the heavy-handed use of security forces to crush dissent, critics and rights groups say.\n\nIn a national address, Bangladesh's army chief Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman said the military would form an interim government, but student protest leaders have called for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to lead a temporary administration.\n\nLater on Tuesday, a source at the Yunus Centre think tank in Dhaka confirmed to CNN that its founder had agreed to return to Bangladesh to fulfil the protesters' request for him to serve as head of the interim government, while the country's main opposition party offered its full support to student protesters.\n\nWhat began as peaceful protests by students against civil service job quotas morphed into a nationwide push to force Hasina out after demonstrators were met with a government crackdown that killed about 300 people, according to local media and agencies.\n\nHasina blamed the opposition for the violence and imposed internet blocks and an indefinite curfew across the country.\n\nHer response inflamed the protesters further and, in the end, the world's longest-serving female head of government had to quickly flee the country with her sister to India before crowds stormed her official residence, smashing walls and looting its contents.\n\nStudents began protesting on July 1 at the prestigious Dhaka University demanding an end to the government's quota system, which reserves 30% of civil service posts for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nMany of the country's contemporary political elite are related to that generation - including Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nThe reserved roles were linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters said the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina's ruling Awami League party.\n\nDriving the anger was high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it slowed in the post-pandemic era and is beset with high inflation and depleted foreign currency reserves. In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.\n\nThe protests turned violent on July 15 and the government's increasingly deadly response fueled their anger further, even after the Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs and internet blocks were lifted.\n\nAfter Hasina's resignation on Monday, celebration soon gave way to more violence as protesters torched several buildings, including the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum - the ancestral residence of Hasina's father Mujibur Rahman - and Awami League offices, eyewitnesses told CNN.\n\n\"Things turned ugly really quickly,\" said Raiyan Aftab, 23, a student at BRAC University, who said police shot at protesters outside the campus. \"They shot everybody. There is blood in front of my university right now. There's like 30 bodies... I couldn't sleep all night.\"\n\nAcross the capital, anti-government protesters were attacked by police and military personnel, witnesses said. At Dhaka Medical College, police opened fire on protesters, according to a CNN fixer at the scene.\n\nStudents and protesters at Dhaka University Campus and the Shaheed Minar, a national monument in the capital, were beaten by police as they assembled at these locations.\n\n\"I went to Shaheed Minar with my friends to celebrate. It was epic. There's like thousands of people there, everybody went, regardless of class, heritage, religion, we're all together and all the students met up with flags and everything. It was a historic moment,\" said Aftab. \"But it was short lived.\"\n\nMeanwhile, images appeared online of young people guarding Hindu temples as misinformation swirled online and a mob attacked a temple, according to the director of the Meherpur ISKCON temple.\n\nThe demonstrations became the ultimate challenge to Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced the release of opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia - a longtime Hasina rival - who had been jailed in 2018 on graft charges which she denies. Other student protesters and those arrested on \"false cases,\" were also released, the president said.\n\nHasina's political career spanned decades since returning from exile in the early 1980s following the assassination of her father and most of her family.

The Students Against Discrimination group also confirmed his return, telling CNN in a text message: \"We are very delighted to say that Dr. Yunus has agreed to accept this challenge to save Bangladesh as per our student's request.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN Monday, Yunus said he wanted to see the army hand control of the country to a civilian government.\n\n\"People are celebrating on the street and millions and millions of people all over Bangladesh [are] celebrating as if this is our liberation day,\" he said.\n\nWhile Hasina's resignation was celebrated, some Bangladeshis expressed trepidation over the path ahead as the country attempts to fill a leadership vacuum.\n\n\"Hasina may be gone, but there is still a long road ahead for Bangladesh,\" student Faiza Chowdhury, 25, told CNN. \"Until our religious minorities and ethnic minorities are protected and justice comes to them too, the nation is not free.\"\n\nProtester Aftab was wary of the military holding on to power.\n\n\"We have to remember the last 15 years, the army didn't do anything.

Waker-uz-Zaman confirmed Hasina had resigned and said the military would form an interim government.\n\nAddressing protesters, largely young Bangladeshis and students, he said: \"Whatever demands you have we will fulfil and bring back peace to the nation, please help us in this, stay away from violence.\"\n\n\"The military will not fire at anyone, the police will not fire at anyone, I have given orders,\" he added.\n\nA senior official from Bangladesh's foreign ministry told CNN on Tuesday that Hasina is now in a \"safer\" location \"close to Delhi.\"\n\nImages showed flames billowing from vehicles near Hasina's house, and protesters inside the building, smashing walls and looting its contents.\n\nEarlier in the day, the military and police had attacked demonstrators rallying in the area, according to a journalist working for CNN in Dhaka.\n\nAt least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday in clashes between police and protesters demanding the scrapping of quotas for government jobs and the resignation of the prime minister. Opponents argued the civil service job quotas were discriminatory.\n\nThe death toll on Sunday, which included 13 police officers, was the highest for a single day from any protests in the country's recent history.\n\nThe figure surpassed the 67 deaths reported on July 19, when students took to the streets against the quotas, Reuters reported. At least 32 children were killed during protests last month, UNICEF said on Friday.\n\nThe widespread unrest - which spilled into the cities of Rajshahi, Barisal and Chittagong among others - prompted the government to impose an indefinite nationwide curfew over the weekend. Meanwhile, human rights groups accused authorities of using excessive force against protesters, a charge the government denied.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Tuesday announced the release of opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia - a bitter rival to Hasina - along with student protesters and those arrested on \"false cases,\" according to state news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS).\n\nShahabuddin said the current parliament would be dissolved immediately and an interim government should be formed in consultation with all parties and stakeholders to hold elections as soon as possible, according to BSS.\n\nNafiz Basher, an organizing member of Students Against Discrimination, which led the protest movement, told CNN that the group's movement's representatives would meet the army chief on Tuesday.\n\nStudent leader Muhammad Nahid Islam said they hadn't met all of their goals, and after Hasina's resignation, the group wanted to \"abolish fascist systems forever.\"\n\nHe said the group wanted to see Bangladeshi Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus lead an interim government. \"We have given our blood, we have been martyred, our vision of forming a new Bangladesh will now have to be realised,\" he said.\n\nYunus told CNN on Monday that he wanted to see the army hand control of the country to a civilian government. \"People are celebrating on the street and millions and millions of people all over Bangladesh [are] celebrating as if this is our liberation day,\" he said.\n\nThe US State Department and the UN Secretary General both urged restraint and for all parties to refrain from further violence following the prime minister's resignation.\n\n\"Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,\" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing on Monday.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasized \"the importance of a peaceful, orderly and democratic transition,\" according to a statement from his deputy spokesperson.\n\n\"The Secretary-General stands in full solidarity with the people of Bangladesh and ... continues to underscore the need for a full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence,\" Farhan Haq said.\n\nThe US embassy in Dhaka urged US citizens to \"shelter in a safe place,\" in new travel guidance issued Monday. Authorities added that US nationals in the capital should consider returning to their home country, amid the \"unpredictable and volatile\" atmosphere.\n\nThe main flight hub in Dhaka, the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, was temporarily closed following Hasina's resignation, according to the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) state news agency.\n\nEarlier this year human rights organizations expressed concern over increased reports of political violence, following a general election that saw Hasina secure a fourth consecutive term in office.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotted the national vote in January, as critics warned Hasina and her government were headed toward a one-party system marred by accusations of authoritarianism.\n\nWhile Hasina's resignation was celebrated, some Bangladeshis expressed trepidation as to the path ahead as the country attempts to fill a leadership vacuum.\n\n\"Hasina may be gone, but there is still a long road ahead for Bangladesh - until our religious minorities and ethnic minorities are protected and justice comes to them too, the nation is not free,\" Khatib Zahin, 28, told CNN.\n\nAnother resident, Arifeen Mahmood Khan, said: \"Let's be better, stronger and kinder than we've ever been before. Let's work together to build a better Bangladesh we've always dreamed of.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Hasina had accused student protesters of being \"terrorists,\" attempting to \"destabilize the nation,\" Reuters reported. \"I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand,\" she said.\n\nPolice opened fire on protesters in Dhaka that day, according to a journalist working for CNN, despite intense criticism of alleged brutality by security forces against demonstrators.\n\nAt least four people sustained injuries as protesters gathered at Dhaka Medical College on Monday, according to the journalist. One of those people was shot in the head.\n\nProtesters told CNN that \u2060the military was blocking Dhaka Medical College Bakshibazar Gate. Police also used tear gas on protesters there, according to a demonstrator.\n\nStudents and protesters at Dhaka University Campus and the Shaheed Minar, a national monument in the capital, were beaten by police as they assembled at these locations.\n\nProtesters there said that the police had attempted to break up the crowd by \"brutally beating\" them with bamboo sticks and using tear gas.\n\n\"Direct open firing took place in Shahbag area 15 minutes ago. We don't have an estimate of how many were injured. It is still ongoing. Near Motijhil Shantinagar, tear gas has been fired on common people,\" one demonstrator told CNN.\n\nIn other locations across Dhaka, the military also fired warning shots in the sky and towards protesters.\n\nDetails and videos were scant due to a communications blackout ordered by the government, which led to a \"near-total national internet shutdown after earlier social media and mobile cuts\" according to data from Netblocks, a global internet monitor.\n\nVideo posted on social media and verified by CNN showed security forces launching live rounds into the air near protesters on the N1 highway in Dhaka.\n\nProtesters in Dhaka told CNN that the university campus had been surrounded by armed forces. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title":

Almost 100 protesters had been killed in a brutal crackdown by Sheikh Hasina, the country's long-serving prime minister.\n\nThe response by the increasingly paranoid 76-year-old autocrat -- which brought the total death toll from three weeks of protests to 300 -- proved a dramatic miscalculation, alienating not just the public but also her most powerful backers, including the military and garment industry tycoons that had hours earlier loyally defended her.\n\nBy midday on Monday a growing mass of protesters -- which spanned liberal students, labourers and pious Muslims -- ignored calls to disperse and approached her grand central Dhaka residence, Gono Bhaban.\n\nWith thousands on the streets outside, Sheikh Hasina's advisers and family members convinced her to resign and flee the country, according to her relatives and media reports, an outcome that would have seemed hard to imagine even that morning.\n\nHer hasty departure to neighbouring India and exile brought to an end 15 years of increasingly repressive rule in Bangladesh that had made Sheikh Hasina -- the survivor of several assassination attempts -- the world's longest-serving female leader.\n\nIt has also opened a dangerous political vacuum in Bangladesh. Even as jubilant crowds ransacked the prime minister's residence, the elation was tempered by mounting alarm about spreading vandalism and retributory violence, and questions about what the future holds for the country of 170mn.\n\nThe military has quickly stepped in, announcing talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin, and political parties on forming an interim government. Student leaders have called for Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus to take on an advisory role ahead of elections.\n\nBut they do not yet know whether they can trust the army, which has frequently intervened in Bangladesh's politics through dictatorships and coups.\n\n\"It became clear that neither her police force, nor the army could prevent the onslaught,\" said Cynthia Farid, a Supreme Court lawyer, of Sheikh Hasina's resignation. \"Wherever we go from here will clearly involve the army to restore calm\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009However, they must return to the barracks in the shortest possible time.\"\n\nSheikh Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was first elected in the 1990s and had been in power continuously since 2009.\n\nBangladesh, once one of the world's poorest countries, has developed rapidly thanks in part to its lucrative garments export sector, which is now the second-largest. This allowed Sheikh Hasina to tout her development record, as she deftly balanced ties with India, China and the west.\n\nYet she also built a personality cult around her family, while her government oversaw extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances and rigged elections to remain in office.\n\nShe was elected to a fifth term earlier this year unopposed after rounding up thousands of rivals, a victory that appeared to cement her status as an immovable political force.\n\nWhen protests began last month, regime change was not among the demands. University students, angered by an economic slowdown and rampant corruption, were opposing a quota system that reserved a third of government jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's 1971 independence war with Pakistan and their descendants. The scheme guaranteed jobs for those loyal to Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, which considers itself the heir of the independence struggle.\n\nIn late July, police and Awami League loyalists attacked the demonstrators, killing scores. Garment factories were forced to shut for days, delaying orders to western brands that depend on the country including H&M and Zara.\n\nThe supreme court eventually watered down the quota scheme, but it was too late. By the time protesters regrouped over the weekend, the movement had transformed into an uprising against her rule.\n\nAs demonstrators defied the curfew on Monday morning, the prime minister called the heads of security forces and ordered them to halt the procession by force, according to Bangladesh's Prothom Alo newspaper.\n\nYet even Sheikh Hasina's enablers recognised that further suppression would fail. \"Students were standing in front of gun points,\" said Zillur Rahman, executive director of the Dhaka-based think-tank the Centre for Governance Studies. \"She had total control over the army, law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies. But the people changed [the security forces'] minds.\"\n\nSoldiers, rather than enforce the curfew, shook hands with smiling demonstrators. Garment industry owners said in a statement that they could not \"watch the sad loss of innocent lives and people's demands go unheard\".\n\nWith the crowds reportedly less than an hour away, Sheikh Hasina's family implored her to leave. Her own father and other relatives were massacred by mutinous soldiers in 1975.\n\n\"She wanted to stay,\" Sajeeb Wazed, her son, told Indian broadcaster NDTV. \"But we kept insisting it wasn't safe\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009So we persuaded her.\"\n\nSheikh Hasina was whisked to a military helicopter, alongside her sister Sheikh Rehana. She would land on Monday evening at an air force base near New Delhi, and is reportedly seeking shelter in a third country.\n\nThe protesters waving Bangladeshi flags over-ran her Gono Bhaban residence, clambering on the roof and pilfering household items, from decorative vases to ceiling fans and even fish from the kitchen.\n\nBut the celebrations masked a darker turn. Some Bangladeshis, boiling with rage after years of repression, went on a rampage, burning down police stations and the houses of Awami League officials, including the home minister.\n\nThey also attacked a statue of Sheikh Hasina's father Sheikh Mujib, vandalised shrines known as \"Mujib Corners\" and set alight a memorial museum devoted to his memory.\n\nThe military imposed a fresh curfew overnight and army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman implored the public to stop \"the destruction, killing and violence\", to little effect. More than 100 people were killed in the violence and looting that spread across the country on Monday, according to tallies in local media.\n\nBangladeshis who risked their lives to protest against Sheikh Hasina's regime are now anxiously awaiting the outcome of this new era of political turmoil. It remains unclear who will take charge of the government and when -- or if -- the protesters can expect their calls for free elections to be met.\n\nKamal Ahmed, a political columnist, said the protests were a clear demand for \"a new social contract\" but warned that the chaotic situation risked becoming \"unmanageable and uncontrollable\".\n\n\"It's a crucial period,\" he said. \"These young people are not going to give up.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Times", "body": "A day after the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, parliament in Bangladesh was dissolved. That was an important demand of the demonstrators who have been protesting against the government for weeks. Student leaders had threatened to continue the protests if parliament remained in session.\n\nThe demonstrators are also against an interim government led by the military. They demand a prominent role for banker and Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. According to the BBC, he is willing to take on that task. Yunis is internationally known as the founder of microcredit to people who do not have access to large loans.\n\nBangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin has promised in a televised speech that elections will be held as soon as possible. He also announced that demonstrators who have been arrested in the past period will be released. He also reported that Hasina's previous prime minister and arch-enemy, Khaleda Zia, had been released. This would also apply to other political opponents of the old regime.\n\nProtests in Bangladesh began last month when students from the University of Dhaka took to the streets with banners to express their dissatisfaction over a new job quota. More than half of all government jobs must be distributed among certain groups according to that quota. For example, a third goes to families of veterans who fought for the country's independence in 1971. Students feared that this measure would make it even more difficult to find a job.\n\nThey also saw it as a way for Prime Minister Hasina to strengthen the position of her supporters, because she herself is the daughter of one of the country's best-known independence fighters.\n\nAfter a peaceful start, the army and police intervened violently. More than 10,000 students were arrested. A total of about 400 demonstrators were also killed. Yesterday, the day of Hasina's resignation, was the bloodiest day. According to local sources, 100 people were killed in violent clashes, although the latter figures have not been confirmed by the police.\n\nAs the demonstrations and violence increased, the protest broadened and demands were made for Hasina to resign. She has been in power for the past 15 years and, according to critics and human rights organizations, led the country in an increasingly autocratic manner. She won the elections again in January, but the opposition had already been sidelined. Human rights organizations raised the alarm last year about another major protest in the country. Even then there was violence, torture and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators.\n\nAfter resigning, Hasina was taken to India by a military plane yesterday. According to Indian media, she has tried to apply for asylum in the United Kingdom, but because the terms have not been agreed, she is still in India.", "source": {"uri": "oyetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oye!

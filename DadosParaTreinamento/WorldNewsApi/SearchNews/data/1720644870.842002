The singer, 31, looked visibly tense as he stepped out with his new girlfriend to meet pals in West London, after being at the centre of the bombshell accusations since Wednesday. Conor and his girlfriend were seen heading out for drinks with a group of friends at Battersea Park. The star is yet to comment on Charlotte's claims, thought an awkward clip has since resurfaced which shows Conor joking he has fathered multiple children. It comes just four days after Charlotte, 32, who met Conor at The Traitors' wrap party, revealed that Conor was the father of her 'miracle' baby. Conor was at the party because his younger sister Anna Maynard is dating Harry Clark, the winner of Charlotte's series of The Traitors, which aired back in January. On Friday, an old awkward clip of Conor 'joking' that he had fathered multiple children also resurfaced. Charlotte has also claimed that it was Harry who had 'pressured' her into attending the show wrap party in January because Conor had learnt she was newly single and wanted to meet her. It came just days after the recruitment manager announced her split from wife Laura. Charlotte had longed for years for a baby, and endured several failed IVF rounds with her estranged wife before conceiving naturally with Conor. Now, despite being overjoyed by her 'miracle baby', Charlotte has been troubled by Conor's alleged attempts to 'silence her'. Charlotte - now five months pregnant - took her Instagram Stories on Thursday to thank her followers for all their 'kind messages and advice'. She had told Metro.co.uk the previous day: 'I very nearly didn't go [to the wrap party] at all because I didn't even know who Conor Maynard is. Harry was putting on the pressure. 'Conor was next to me all night pursuing me. I was rude as hell to him for hours, which apparently was the thing he liked. 'But, he was also a gentleman. I'd just got out of a really toxic relationship, and I was quite vulnerable to someone being nice to me. 'If I wanted to go to the toilet, he escorted me. He'd wait outside holding my bag, and take me back.' She revealed the pair ended up sleeping together and also hung out the next day. They kept in touch over the phone and had planned to meet up again but their schedules got in the way and talk soon fizzled out. However, after feeling unwell, Charlotte - who believed she was infertile after her IVF struggles - took a pregnancy test on her mother's advice and discovered that she was expecting. Having previously experienced seven miscarriages, Charlotte opted to wait until a few weeks later when she was feeling more confident about her pregnancy. She claimed that Conor was initially 'lovely' about the news, but later expressed that he was not ready to be a father. Charlotte recalled: 'The minute I started talking about co-parenting and being understanding of his work schedule, he obviously was a bit disappointed that I was doing that.' She now says she is 'unclear' about the level of involvement Conor will have in their daughter's life. Earlier on Thursday, Charlotte made her big reveal in an Instagram video, explaining: 'I\u2019ve really toyed with whether this is the right thing to do or not... \u2018I\u2019ve sort of hidden a lot of things in the protection of somebody else through this process. \u2018I decided that the best thing is to always be open and honest. Essentially I have not named the father in protection of him.\u2019 Charlotte claimed she was warned by a PR that she could be hated if she revealed the news but said the baby means more to her and said keeping a secret had a detrimental impact on her mental health. \u2018I\u2019m prepared to do this alone, but I\u2019m not prepared to have my daughter have to grow up and not be able to say who her father is, or should I say, birth father, or hide it from her,\u2019 she said. \u2018She deserves to know where she comes from. I\u2019m not a secret, she\u2019s not a dirty secret and I won\u2019t be silenced.\u2019 \u2018I am standing up for myself regardless of if it comes back to me. I just can\u2019t do this be quiet, and shut up anymore. \u2018I feel like I just don\u2019t matter, and I just don\u2019t want that for my daughter so even though this makes me feel sick to do because everyone\u2019s told me not to, in terms of his PR and stuff.\u2019 Charlotte concluded: \u2018My friends and family are behind me. The cast are behind me that I need to put Penelope first. When I say the cast, I mean the majority of the cast. But I\u2019m speaking out, I won\u2019t be silenced anymore and now you all know.' It's a revelation that has torn the cast of The Traitors apart. Show winner Harry is close with the Maynard brothers, often appearing in their social media posts. While he and Charlotte were friends on the show they do not follow each other on social media. It is not clear if they used to. Charlotte pointedly noted that she had 'the majority' of her Traitors co-stars on her side, with many of them rushing to comment on her video. It was revealed later that month that Charlotte had split from her wife Laura. Charlotte uploaded a sweet gender reveal video with her family, in which she watched her baby scan before it lit up with pink lights, indicating she is expecting a girl. She captioned the sweet clip: 'GENDER REVEAL!! I would have been happy either way but I did want a little mini me!!' She continued: 'I have already leaked her perfect little name! Did you catch her name?? She is already so loved !! So many changes going in my life and I can't wait to tell you all about it !! Watch this space!!!' Charlotte's wife Laura did not appear in the video and the reality star tellingly added the hashtags: '#singlemoms #singlemum #singlemumsuk #independent #femaleempowerment' to confirm her single status. Charlotte soared to fame on The Traitors and was wrongly 'banished' on the show by her co-stars who didn't believe she was 'Faithful'. Conor is an English singer born and raised in Brighton. He signed a recording contract with Warner Music Group in 2011. He rose to fame when he was nominated for, and subsequently won, MTV's Brand New for 2012 award. In terms of girlfriends he has previously been linked to Love Island's Layla Al-Momani. Layla revealed before heading into the villa that she dated the famous pop star, revealing: 'My ex is a famous singer. He wrote a few songs about me since we broke up.' It is unclear how long the pair dated for exactly, but Layla first shared a snap with Conor in July 2021 of her and the star donning fancy dress as she captioned the post: 'Date night out of the mansion.' She then shared another cosy photo with the singer a month later in August 2021, but there are no posts of them after that date. However, in a heartbreak track shared on TikTok in January, Conor candidly revealed that he went through a breakup at the end of 2022, which some fans have linked to Layla, meaning they may have dated for around 18 months. He said: 'So, the last few months I took a bit of a break from social media because at the end of 2022, I had my heart ripped out. 'But anyway I took that time to write some music about it, and this is a little bit of one of the songs. It's called 'If I Ever'.", "summary": "Conor Maynard, 31, is seen for the first time - with his girlfriend in tow - since The Traitors' Charlotte Chilton, 32, claimed he was the father of her unborn child.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13508913/Conor-Maynard-new-girlfriend-tense-seen-time-father-Charlotte-Chilton-baby.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/15/85874963-0-image-m-83_1717856651068.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/06/4059989276624307692/1024x576_MP4_4059989276624307692.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:55:38", "author": "Chikamso Chukwuenyem,Editor", "authors": ["Chikamso Chukwuenyem", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.235}

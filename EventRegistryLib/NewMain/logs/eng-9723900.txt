A real estate sign is posted outside a home in Pointe-Claire, a city in Montreal's West Island, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christinne MuschiTORONTO - Despite expectations of lower interest rates prompting homebuyers to leave the sidelines, a new report says the Bank of Canada's quarter-point cut to its key interest rate last month did not lead to a rush in demand. The latest Royal LePage house price survey released Thursday, detailing market trends across Canada during the second quarter, said demand continues to outpace supply in the Prairies and Quebec, but Toronto and Vancouver saw slower-than-usual activity this spring. Phil Soper, president and CEO of Royal LePage, said prices have remained sticky in Canada's largest markets. \"This spring, with bank rate cuts highly anticipated, we saw some buyers race to get a deal done ahead of an expected spike in demand,\"\u009d said Soper in a press release. \"Yet, when that first cut finally occurred in early June, market response was tepid.\" A Royal LePage survey conducted by Leger earlier this year suggested 51 per cent of would-be homebuyers would resume their search if interest rates decreased, but just 10 per cent said a 25-basis-point cut would prompt them to jump back into the market. Around 18 per cent said they were waiting for a cut of 50 to 100 basis points, and 23 per cent said they need to see a drop of more than 100 basis points. \"Not surprisingly, the quarter-point cut to the bank rate didn't substantially improve the affordability picture,\" said Soper. \"The tale the market tells as rate cuts get to the point of a material reduction in the cost of borrowing should be a very different one.\"\u009d The national aggregate home price rose 1.9 per cent year-over-year to $824,300 in the second quarter of 2024, which was also a 1.5 per cent increase from the first quarter, according to the report. The figure is compiled from the company's property data nationally and regionally in 64 of Canada's largest real estate markets. When broken out by housing type, the national median price of a single-family detached home increased 2.2 per cent year-over-year to $860,600, while the median price of a condominium increased 1.6 per cent to $596,500. Royal LePage is also forecasting the aggregate price of a home in Canada will increase nine per cent to $860,555 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year.

A real estate sign is posted outside a home in Pointe-Claire, a city in Montreal's West Island, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christinne Muschi\n\nDespite expectations of lower interest rates prompting homebuyers to leave the sidelines, a new report says the Bank of Canada's quarter-point cut to its key interest rate last month did not lead to a rush in demand.\n\nThe latest Royal LePage house price survey released Thursday, detailing market trends across Canada during the second quarter, said demand continues to outpace supply in the Prairies and Quebec, but Toronto and Vancouver saw slower-than-usual activity this spring.\n\nPhil Soper, president and CEO of Royal LePage, said prices have remained sticky in Canada's largest markets.\n\n\"This spring, with bank rate cuts highly anticipated, we saw some buyers race to get a deal done ahead of an expected spike in demand,\" said Soper in a press release.\n\n\"Yet, when that first cut finally occurred in early June, market response was tepid.\"\n\nA Royal LePage survey conducted by Leger earlier this year suggested 51 per cent of would-be homebuyers would resume their search if interest rates decreased, but just 10 per cent said a 25-basis-point cut would prompt them to jump back into the market.\n\nAround 18 per cent said they were waiting for a cut of 50 to 100 basis points, and 23 per cent said they need to see a drop of more than 100 basis points.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, the quarter-point cut to the bank rate didn't substantially improve the affordability picture,\" said Soper.\n\n\"The tale the market tells as rate cuts get to the point of a material reduction in the cost of borrowing should be a very different one.\"\n\nThe national aggregate home price rose 1.9 per cent year-over-year to $824,300 in the second quarter of 2024, which was also a 1.5 per cent increase from the first quarter, according to the report.\n\nThe figure is compiled from the company's property data nationally and regionally in 64 of Canada's largest real estate markets.\n\nWhen broken out by housing type, the national median price of a single-family detached home increased 2.2 per cent year-over-year to $860,600, while the median price of a condominium increased 1.6 per cent to $596,500.\n\nRoyal LePage is also forecasting the aggregate price of a home in Canada will increase nine per cent to $860,555 in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net",

The protesters complied but promised to keep putting pressure on the university in other ways to push their demands, which include disclosing and divesting from investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza.\n\nSeveral similar encampments at other Ontario universities have since been dismantled, some under threat of legal action.\n\nWhile each case is different, experts say the U of T court ruling raises questions about balancing free expression and property rights at academic institutions while possibly setting a precedent for how future campus protests are handled.\n\n---\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"},

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Mark Schiefelbein\n\nHere is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to bring you up to speed...\n\nCanada set to provide details on defence funding\n\nCanada is expected to provide more details about its plan to meet defence spending targets in an effort to quell concerns that have dogged the prime minister during this week's NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nNATO allies have agreed to spend at least the equivalent of two per cent of their national gross domestic product on defence, but Canada has long fallen short.\n\nA senior government official speaking on background says Canada will provide a timeline to reach the funding goal and more information on its plan Thursday.\n\nTrudeau is expected to continue pushing for allies to provide support for Ukraine, as the war-ravaged country, which is facing escalating aggression from Russia, has been a rallying point for NATO support.\n\nJudge to give verdict in serial killer trial\n\nA judge is scheduled to give his decision today in the first-degree murder trial of a man who admitted to killing four women in Winnipeg.\n\nLawyers for Jeremy Skibicki argue he should be found not criminally responsible and say he was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the slayings in 2022.\n\nBut Crown prosecutors say he had the mental capacity and awareness to commit and cover up the killings.\n\nThey have characterized the killings as racially motivated and say the 37-year-old targeted the Indigenous women at homeless shelters.\n\nThe case sparked calls for governments and organizations to address the ongoing issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nNew evacuation order for central B.C. district\n\nA new wildfire in B.C.'s central region has triggered an evacuation order for the northeast corner of the District of Wells.\n\nDistrict officials say the Cornish Mountain Wildfire is a threat to life and safety, and impacted residents must leave immediately.\n\nThe affected areas include the Eight- and Nine-Mile Lake Areas, Cornish Lake, and Mine Sites.\n\nAn evacuation alert remains in effect for the rest of the district.\n\nThe province is currently dealing with 146 wildfires, with two considered \"of note.\"\n\nHome prices reached $824,300 last quarter: report\n\nDespite expectations of lower interest rates prompting homebuyers to leave the sidelines, a new report says the Bank of Canada's quarter-point cut to its key interest rate last month did not lead to a rush in demand.\n\nThe latest Royal LePage house price survey released Thursday, detailing market trends across Canada during the second quarter, said demand continues to outpace supply in the Prairies and Quebec, but Toronto and Vancouver saw slower-than-usual activity this spring.\n\nPhil Soper, president and CEO of Royal LePage, said prices have remained sticky in Canada's largest markets.\n\nA Royal LePage survey conducted by Leger earlier this year suggested 51 per cent of would-be homebuyers would resume their search if interest rates decreased, but just 10 per cent said a 25-basis-point cut would prompt them to jump back into the market.\n\nUofT encampment order could affect future protests\n\nA pro-Palestinian protest encampment that stood for weeks at the heart of the University of Toronto may now be gone, but experts say the court ruling that led to its clearing could have lingering effects for future protests on post-secondary campuses in Canada.\n\nLast week, a judge authorized police to take action if protesters didn't leave the encampment site by a set deadline. The protesters complied but promised to keep putting pressure on the university in other ways to push their demands, which include disclosing and divesting from investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza.\n\nSeveral similar encampments at other Ontario universities have since been dismantled, some under threat of legal action.\n\nWhile each case is different, experts say the U of T court ruling raises questions about balancing free expression and property rights at academic institutions while possibly setting a precedent for how future campus protests are handled.\n\n--\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Lethbridge Herald - News and Sports

The median prices for both detached and condo-style properties were up on a quarterly and annual basis in Q2, the report noted, each rising by low single-digit percentages.\n\nSoper says that while a slow housing market usually sees sellers compromise on price to get their home sold, Canada's structural supply shortages have kept values elevated even in a cooler period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Prairies and Atlantic Canada -- the beneficiaries of interprovincial migration -- are seeing price increases amid hot competition for homes in cities like Edmonton and Calgary, Soper says.\n\nRoyal LePage is maintaining its forecast for a nine per cent annual increase in home price values in the fourth quarter of 2024, but Soper notes that prices were heading down nationally in the final quarter of 2023, which can make the modest improvements in home prices this year seem outsized in comparison.\n\nFrom the midpoint of 2024 through to the end of the year, he expects price growth will be more in the low-to-mid single digits.\n\nRoyal LePage doesn't have a rate cut pencilled in at the Bank of Canada's next decision on July 24, which he says means that mortgage rates won't fall much further from today's levels heading into autumn.\n\nBut \"demand is building,\" Soper says, as Canada's population grows and savings rates climb, particularly among a millennial generation that's eager to make moves in the housing market.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada",

The protesters complied but promised to keep putting pressure on the university in other ways to push their demands, which include disclosing and divesting from investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza.\n\nSeveral similar encampments at other Ontario universities have since been dismantled, some under threat of legal action.\n\nWhile each case is different, experts say the U of T court ruling raises questions about balancing free expression and property rights at academic institutions while possibly setting a precedent for how future campus protests are handled.\n\n--\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024\n\nPresident Joe Biden, left, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, right, greet Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, as they arrive for a welcome ceremony at the NATO summit in Washington, Wednesday, July 10, 2024.

On a quarterly basis, prices were up 1.5 per cent. Royal LePage calculates aggregate prices using a weighted average of the median value of all housing types.\n\nThe increase came despite a slowdown in Canadian housing activity across the country. National home sales were down 5.9 per cent on an annual basis in May, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). In Canada's most expensive housing markets, the slowdown has been even more pronounced. Greater Toronto home sales declined 16.4 per cent in June, while Vancouver home sales fell 19.1 per cent.\n\nRoyal LePage president and CEO Phil Soper called the increase in prices amid sagging sales \"an unusual dynamic.\"\n\n\"Canada's housing market is struggling to find a consistent rhythm, as the last three months clearly demonstrated,\" Soper said in a statement.\n\n\"The silver lining: inventory levels in many regions have climbed materially. This is the closest we've been to a balanced market in several years.\"\n\nThe slump in sales comes as the Bank of Canada embarks on a loosening cycle following an aggressive tightening campaign. The central bank cut its key rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent in June, the first reduction in more than four years and the first cut from a G7 central bank. Still, the decrease in the benchmark rate was not enough to get buyers off the sidelines in a meaningful way.\n\nA Royal LePage survey conducted by Leger earlier this year found that 51 per cent of sidelined homebuyers said they would resume their search if interest rates reversed. Just 10 per cent said a 25 basis point hike would be enough to get them back into the market, while 18 per cent said they would need rates to be between 50 and 100 basis points lower, and 23 per cent said they would need to see more than 100 basis points of cuts get off the sidelines.\n\n\"This spring, with bank rate cuts highly anticipated, we saw some buyers race to get a deal done ahead of an expected spike in demand. Yet, when that first cut finally occurred in early June, market response was tepid,\" Soper said, noting that the cut didn't substantially improve affordability.\n\n\"The tale the market tells as rate cuts get to the point of a material reduction in the cost of borrowing should be a very different one.\"\n\nDespite the so-far tepid response to the Bank of Canada's rate cut, Royal LePage maintained its year-end forecast and expects home prices to increase 9 per cent annually by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nRoyal LePage expects the Greater Toronto Area will see the greatest price appreciation of all major markets in the fourth quarter of 2024, with prices set to increase 10 per cent. The Greater Vancouver area will see prices increase 5.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while Montreal will see prices increase 8.5 per cent.\n\nCalgary, which has seen sales activity remain strong through 2024, is expected to see prices increases 8 per cent in the fourth quarter. Edmonton will see a 6.5 per cent increase, Royal LePage said.\n\nAlicja Siekierska is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance Canada.

The protesters complied but promised to keep putting pressure on the university in other ways to push their demands, which include disclosing and divesting from investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza.\n\nSeveral similar encampments at other Ontario universities have since been dismantled, some under threat of legal action.\n\nWhile each case is different, experts say the U of T court ruling raises questions about balancing free expression and property rights at academic institutions while possibly setting a precedent for how future campus protests are handled.\n\n--\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2024", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Sales could be especially strong toward the end of the year if interest rates continue to go down.\n\n\"My hope, however, is that rate cuts will roll out gradually so that supply levels have enough time to be replenished ahead of rising buyer demand,\" Lyall said.\n\nRoyal LePage is forecasting that the aggregate price of a home in Calgary will increase 8.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter last year. Nationally, it predicts the aggregate home price will increase to nine per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nAcross the country, the aggregate price of a home increased 1.9 per cent year over year to $824,300.", "source": {"uri": "calgary.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityNews Calgary"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauryn_heintz@calgary.citynews.ca", "name": "Lauryn Heintz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_LePage", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal LePage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-family detached home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://calgary.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/8/2024/07/445101ea-5080-4c8e-9b3a-ce87e7f74aff.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723900", "eventUri": "eng-9723900", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 231278148, "title": "From vacant to vibrant: How Indio is revitalizing downtown with new shops, dining, homes", "text": "For years, Yellow Mart endured as something of an island floating in the sea of empty storefronts that had become downtown Indio. Mark Jernigan, who runs the shop, recalls that at one point things got so bad that there were only a couple of open businesses on the three-block downtown stretch of Miles Avenue. \u201cThat building was empty, that building was empty, that building was empty and then that building was empty for a long time,\u201d he said as he pointed around to some of the neighboring retail spaces. \u201cThe problem was it looked like a ghost town because everybody was going out of business.\u201d But, Jernigan knew there was a time when things had been different. \u201cWillie Lewis, who worked in the store for 50 years, told me of the old days of not being able to find a parking spot and walking shoulder to shoulder with people because the sidewalk was so full,\u201d he said. Recently, Jernigan has been finding reason to hope that downtown Indio\u2019s future will be brighter than its recent past. When he gazes out from Yellow Mart\u2019s massive windows these days, he no longer sees lifeless sidewalks leading to mostly empty, often dilapidated buildings. Instead, there\u2019s more likely to be people clutching shopping bags or coffee cups, dropping off their kids for guitar lessons or heading out for crepes, craft beers or even calimari at one of the new restaurants that have been popping up at a dizzying rate. The new eateries that have opened just since March include a Mexican restaurant called Victoria\u2019s Caf\u00e9, a self-described elevated watering hole called the Indio Taphouse, the second location of Gabino\u2019s Creperie and, perhaps most surprising, a \u201cspeakeasy\u201d called Italica where one can order a $19 cocktail to go with their $138 steak (yes, really). Then there are the other new additions, which include a record store that also specializes in unique rocks, a vintage clothes and goods store and two new venues for live music (one of which doubles as a coffee shop). And beyond shopping, a 64-unit, $25 million apartment complex is in the works in the heart of downtown, having broken ground in late May. More: Former NFL star from Indio aims to help in city's revitalization City purchase of buildings paved way for new development While the ongoing revival might seem to have happened suddenly, city leaders say the process has been anything but. Miguel Ramirez-Cornejo, the city\u2019s economic development manager, said that while leaders and residents alike have wanted to see such renewal happen for years, those efforts gained steam in 2020 when the city council adopted a plan that envisioned how downtown it could be transformed. Pivotal to that process has been a years-long city effort to acquire properties around downtown that Ramirez-Cornejo said allow city staff to recruit and rent directly to new businesses. The city envisions a collection of restaurants, shops and offices that complement each other and entice people to walk around and discover new places, instead of visiting one spot and driving away after getting what they need. As part of its effort to lure new businesses, the city also created a program that lets them reduce some taxes, delay others and receive funding for additional building improvements. Businesses lured by area's potential, city's young population Skip Paige, who co-owns The Indio Taphouse and neighboring Italica, said that assistance and the great overall deal he was offered by the city helped lure him to take a \u201crisk\u201d and open the new restaurants. However, he says he was also intrigued by the possibility of his adopted home of Indio undergoing the same kind of transformation he saw a quarter-century ago in the city where he grew up, Pomona. There, Paige helped build and open a concert venue called the Glass House inside an old pharmacy on Second Street, a once-lively downtown Pomona strip that had fallen into decline with the rise of Interstate 10. He describes what happened next as \u201cunbelievable\u201d: New businesses gradually started popping up, including a Thai restaurant, a skateboard shop and an art school. An old theater was also brought back to life with the help of city funds. \u201cNow you go down there and it\u2019s like hipster heaven down there,\u201d he said of Pomona's downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s all cool kids, it\u2019s all multicultural, it\u2019s all people going to restaurants and going to concerts and populating the downtown area \u2014 it\u2019s cool.\u201d Paige has longtime Indio connections: He opened the Glass House with his friend Paul Tollett, the CEO of music promoter Goldenvoice, where Paige spent years working as COO. Paige said he had long ago taken note of the fact that Indio's Miles Avenue dates back to the same era as Pomona's Second Street \u2014 and even has similar architecture \u2014 and used to muse about it undergoing a similar transformation. Paige credits Indio city staff with making that happen. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be one of the hottest little hospitality districts in the desert,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Palm Canyon, El Paseo, Old Town La Quinta and now you\u2019ve got downtown Indio.\u201d Also going \u201call-in,\u201d as he puts it, on downtown Indio is Palm Springs real estate agent and developer Adam Gilbert. He bought two large commercial buildings downtown and has tentative plans for both. In one, he wants to open a market called The Place that brings together various artisans and vendors, similar to Palm Springs\u2019 Mojave Flea Trading Post. In the other building, Gilbert plans some sort of food hall in the other, although the exact form it will take is still being determined due to the high costs of building out a traditional food hall. Gilbert said he was drawn by the investment the city and others were making, but also the fact that Indio residents are on the whole significantly younger than in many other Coachella Valley cities. A downtown that caters more to that demographic could become a magnet for younger people from throughout the valley, Gilbert said. He also thinks downtown Indio's layout opens possibilities not seen in other valley shopping districts. On El Paseo or downtown Palm Springs' Palm Canyon Avenue, the bulk of activity is on one long street. But downtown Indio is a grid centered around Miles Avenue with multiple streets coming off of it. That makes it easier to build a downtown around more than shopping, Gilbert said, something that is evident in the ongoing work to build a new city hall, a new library and a College of the Desert campus in the area. There are also plans, some already in progress, to turn the downtown area into a hub for the kind of denser housing that does not exist \u2014 and is often not allowed \u2014 in much of the Coachella Valley. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to go high, four stories by right and six stories with council approval,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIf there is going to be any density it\u2019s going to be there (in downtown Indio).\u201d Changing city's image Beyond working to attract businesses, Indio officials say the city has worked to plan events that will bring people to downtown, including the weekly Food Truck Fridays event. That effort has gained new momentum with the opening of Center Stage, an outdoor concert stage that recently hosted the high-profile free performance by Indio native and American Idol winner Abi Carter (city officials joke they couldn\u2019t have planned the timing better). \u201cIt\u2019s not just doing an advertising campaign and saying \u2018come to downtown Indio.\u2019 We\u2019re trying to say \u2018come to this concert\u2019 and then show people (what we have to offer), because the likelihood of them coming back is stronger than us trying to force that message,\u201d said Jessica Mediano, who does marketing and PR work for the city. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a space that is actually inviting, not just in a photo.\u201d A major emphasis of that effort has been making downtown look and feel like a destination by bringing art to the area. Recent additions have included several murals, a new \u201cart alley\u201d and even art from past Goldenvoice music festivals that has been set up in downtown parks. Ramirez-Cornejo, the city's economic development manager, said that's all aimed at getting both Indio locals and those from other valley cities and points beyond to change their mindset from \u201cthe only fun things to do are on the other side of the valley\u201d to \u201cnow it\u2019s here at home or in Indio.\u201d That\u2019s a welcome effort for some of the area\u2019s longstanding business owners, who say they also had to struggle against the perception held by some in other valley cities that Indio was unsafe and run down and had little to offer them. Jernigan, of Yellow Mart, said the redevelopment efforts seem to be succeeding in combatting that image and drawing people from other valley cities back to Indio. He also praised a city effort to bring in a security guard who patrols around downtown on weekend nights until the bars close. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to do little subtle things to try to reassure people that when you\u2019re here, you\u2019re safe, and that\u2019s very, very positive,\u201d he said. That strategy was also praised by Paige, the Taphouse and Italica owner, who said that while historically \u201ceverybody is afraid of Indio,\u201d he also owns Little Bar in Palm Desert and by comparison downtown Indio has \u201cthere\u2019s less riffraff and way more activity.\u201d But while the progress has been remarkable, some challenges remain. Shopping carts filled with belongings and other signs of homelessness and related issues often dot the streetscape, though perhaps to a lesser extent than in downtown Palm Springs. Several buildings, including many on streets branching off of Miles Avenue, appear vacant, though some will soon hold businesses.One large empty structure is a roughly 30,000-square-foot building near the center of the Miles Avenue strip. Ramirez-Cornejo said it has structural issues that would be very expensive to fix and the city is using it to store the items it used for special events while trying to find a creative long-term solution. Keeping it local As downtown steps further into its future, civic leaders, business owners and residents alike say they are also thinking about how to ensure the area reflects the values and character of Indio as it grows in popularity, particularly with those from outside the city. For City Councilmember Elaine Holmes, it is important that downtown be allowed to develop organically rather than according to any single entity\u2019s vision or cookie-cutter plan for what it should look like. \u201cThere's a synergy and an energy that has to occur and it's going to be driven by families and particularly the young folks,\u201d she said. Similar desires to keep the downtown centered on the city\u2019s residents were brought up by several other people involved in the redevelopment, with Paige saying one of Indio\u2019s strengths is that it is more of a true year-round community than a destination focused on catering to retirees or tourists. He said it is important that downtown be made up of \u201call mom-and-pop, homegrown cool businesses\u201d and does not think there should be chains like Chipotle or Chili's there. Paige also said he hopes the changes downtown give residents access to new experiences in a way that is welcoming, which he said is his goal with the higher-end Italica. \u201cWe\u2019re not stuck up and I\u2019m not going for \u2018you don\u2019t belong here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn San Diego, underground speakeasys are everywhere, but there\u2019s a lot of people in Indio who have never seen anything like that. They walk in here and they\u2019re like \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that and I can\u2019t believe its in Indio.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing like this in the whole valley.\u201d Cristina Nagel, who owns the Rocks and Records store with her husband, said she grew up in Indio and has memories of downtown having tons of thrift stores, a JC Penney and just being \u201csuper cool.\u201d She said it feels amazing to be a part of the area\u2019s resurgence but said the goal should not be to gentrify the area but rather to showcase and celebrate Indio\u2019s local community. One idea, she said, is to have regular nights where locals come and ride their lowrider bikes on the street. Ramirez-Cornejo said it can be a tough balance for cities to try to maintain affordability and local businesses and character while ensuring the continued prosperity of a developing downtown. He acknowledged that rents will probably naturally rise in privately owned buildings as the city gets more popular, but said the city\u2019s ownership of other buildings will allow it to have a much greater influence than most cities on how the downtown develops. \u201cIf you look at who has taken ownership of these spaces, it's not someone from LA or Chicago,\u201d Mediano said. \u201cIt's (Gabino\u2019s Creperie owner) Marcel (Ramirez), who is from Indio, went to Palm Springs High School, had his business in Palm Springs and has now been able to expand here.\u201d Indeed, the city\u2019s efforts have been so successful that it's running out of spaces to rent, which Ramirez-Cornejo said is a good problem to have but a bad one for businesses looking to move in. Jernigan, meanwhile, said he is elated to see the rebirth of downtown come through a reembrace of small businesses like his that offer a warmth and personal touch that online shopping and big-box retailers, despite their many advantages, simply can\u2019t compete with. \u201cYou can\u2019t try on a shirt on Amazon, you can\u2019t get that personal touch of asking a question that you can when you come into a store that\u2019s been around a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a throwback to a more personal time, a more personal era, to where people had interactions and looked at each other. And that\u2019s what all these small stores do.\u201d Paul Albani-Burgio covers growth, development and business in the Coachella Valley.

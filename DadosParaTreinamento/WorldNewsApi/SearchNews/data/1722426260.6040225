They may have human names, but these wellbeing warriors are in fact four-legged therapets who are bringing unconditional love, hope and health benefits to the people across the north and north-east of Scotland. From schools, airports and helipads to prisons, hospitals and care homes, the dogs, who are all assessed and vetted by the Canine Concern Scotland Trust charity, are helping to reduce stress and anxiety one tail wag at a time. Today we meet some of the hero hounds \u2013 and their amazing owners \u2013 who are bringing their healing powers to the local community. Let\u2019s start off with a funeral parlour pooch who helps lift people up at the lowest points in their lives\u2026 1. Daisy, the funeral home spaniel who comforts grieving families When Laura Wood sees the comfort her beautiful therapet Daisy gives grieving families, nothing makes her heart sing more. \u201cYou care for your families and my job is to try and look after them as much as possible so seeing my wee dog who means so much to me give so much comfort to them is honestly so lovely,\u201d says Laura. Describing Daisy as a dream dog who always senses when someone needs a cuddle, it was a no brainer for Laura to bring her into Joe Dawsons Funeral Home in Buckie where she works as a funeral director. \u201cI always let families know that I have a therapy dog and ask them if it\u2019s OK,\u201d says Laura. \u201cSomeone once said to me that they weren\u2019t keen on dogs but they were OK with Daisy being there. \u201cWhen they got upset, Daisy jumped up beside them and I was telling her to get down but they said they didn\u2019t mind and they actually appreciated the cuddle which was really sweet. \u201cYou see their face light up \u2013 she\u2019s definitely a comfort.\u201d Daisy made such an impact on one family that they even mentioned her at the funeral. \u201cAt the funeral, the family were very kindly thanking us for everything we\u2019d done and they gave a special thanks to Daisy for being such a comfort and joy to them,\u201d says Laura. \u201cThe celebrant had been doing funerals for 31 years and it was the first time that he\u2019d ever been asked to thank a dog at a funeral service.\u201d 2. The therapets bringing hope and joy to prisoners When Diane Wood MBE takes her therapets Naso and Nola into HMP Grampian in Peterhead every month, the prisoners often tell her it\u2019s the highlight of their week. \u201cThe prisoners also love to hear Naso\u2019s story as he\u2019s a rescue dog from Italy who was found hanging from a tree with his nose and feet duct taped,\u201d says Diane, from Oldmeldrum who was recently awarded an MBE for her incredible work with the charity. \u201cHe\u2019s had a horrible beginning but he\u2019s landed on his feet so they really love Naso and they get so excited to see him.\u201d For the past six years, Diane, who is the chairwoman and area representative for the Canine Concern Scotland Trust, has been visiting the prison with her therapets alongside Bill Ledingham, an orthapedic surgeon who also volunteers his time to take his dogs into the prison. Bill also find the experience rewarding. \u201cThe prisoners have often had dogs themselves that they miss so they like the contact with the dogs,\u201d says Bill. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely as they chat away and often get quite emotional about things.\u201d Leanne Duncan, who is the offender outcomes unit manager at the prison, says the therapets have had such a positive impact. \u201cIt gives the prisoners time to forget about everything else, says Leanne. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a calming time and a relaxing experience. \u201cWe do have individuals that might not necessarily be confident enough when speaking to other people but they will sit and chat to the dog and it\u2019s a different kind of connection. \u201cThat opens up conversations so it allows for personal officers to speak to people and build on our professional relationships as well. \u201cOn the whole it has been very positive for us.\u201d 3. Helpful Hamish, the golden retriever bringing calm to the classroom Watching children read to her gentle golden retriever called Hamish, is always a heartwarming moment for Jean Hopkins. Every Tuesday morning, Jean, who lives in Potterton with her husband John, takes Hamish, a 10-year-old therapet into Udny Green Primary School near Ellon. \u201cHamish loves his trips to the school,\u201d says Jean, who is retired. \u201cSometimes we go for a walk with the children up to Udny Castle or in the wooded area that the children have access to next to the school and sometimes we sit and one of the children will read to Hamish and that\u2019s absolutely lovely. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see a child sitting reading with one hand while stroking Hamish with the other hand.\u201d With his gentle nature, Jean says Hamish brings a sense of calm to the classroom. \u201cHamish is from Budapest in Hungary,\u201d says Jean. \u201cWhen he came to us he was incredibly sad and he didn\u2019t know how to play but our other dog taught him how to play and have fun \u201cHe\u2019s the perfect temperament for a therapet.\u201d 4. The Canine Crew at Aberdeen airport assisting nervous flyers Clair Petrie will never forget the moment her lovable pooch Enzo, a fox red labrador, calmed a distressed passenger at Aberdeen Airport. \u201cI remember there was a bride and groom who had come up to Aberdeen to get married and they were flying back to London but their flight had been cancelled so the poor bride was sitting in floods of tears,\u201d says Clair, 52, an HR team lead from Inverurie. \u201cBut within two or three minutes of meeting Enzo she was composed and hugging the dog. \u201cShe said it really lifted her spirits and calmed her down.\u201d Clair and Enzo are part of the \u2018Canine Crew\u2019, a team of therapets who bring a sense of calm to the check in gates and departure lounge at Aberdeen Airport. Also part of the Canine Crew is Kate Broadley and her happy little pug cross called Doug. \u201cWalking through the airport with your dog is a really bizarre thing to do because you don\u2019t really see dogs in airports but it\u2019s amazing as everyone looks up and smiles,\u201d says Kate, 31, from Aberdeen. \u201cIt also cheers up the staff.\u201d One moment that will always stay with Kate is when Doug helped to calm a little boy down. \u201cThere was a family going away somewhere with a young boy who did not want to get on the plane,\u201d says Kate. \u201cSeeing Doug and walking with the family to the departure gate really calmed him down. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like that which really cement why we do this.\u201d Fraser Bain, project manager at Aberdeen Airport, says the Canine Crew has been a huge success. \u201cThe dogs themselves are obviously a big hit and people love to pat them but people enjoy chatting to the volunteers too,\u201d says Fraser. \u201cThe volunteers often talk about people opening up and share things with them so it\u2019s a great way to open up conversations. \u201cThe other plus side has been the staff side of it as they welcome the dogs as much as the passengers. \u201cThe staff are working hard on the front line so it\u2019s a nice distraction for them too.\u201d 5. Dorothy the Jack Russell, who helps care home residents reminisce Dogs are often said to have a sixth sense and that is certainly the case with Dorothy. The super friendly Jack Russell always seems to know when residents at Pitcairn Lodge Nursing Home in Skene want a cuddle. \u201cShe\u2019s really in tune with the residents there so if someone is upset or a bit distressed she\u2019ll go and seek them out and want to sit with them,\u201d says her owner Carole Ledingham, from Banchory. As the daughter of a dementia sufferer, Carole wanted to share the joy of her dogs with other people who can no longer have a dog of their own. \u201cAnother benefit of Dorothy\u2019s visits is that the residents reminisce about pets they have had in the past,\u201d says Carole, who is a trustee director of Canine Concern Scotland Trust and an area representative for the charity. \u201cThe presence of a dog can stimulate conversation when a friend or relative is visiting. \u201cThis prompt can enable people to talk about family pets or life on the farm with working dogs.\u201d Carole, whose husband Bill (mentioned previously) takes Dorothy plus their other two therapets Wilfred and Vincent to HMP Grampian, says she also gets a lot of their weekly visit to the care home. \u201cI really enjoy our visits to Pitcairn and I get a lot out of it too,\u201d says Carole. \u201cI like being able to chat to the residents and their family and friends and enjoy seeing them getting pleasure from Dorothy\u2019s visit.\u201d 6. The Helipets getting offshore workers talking before they head out to the rigs As a former offshore worker, Dave Duncan knows all too well what it\u2019s like to be waiting around a heliport. \u201cYou see people with faces buried in newspapers,\u201d says Dave. \u201cIn Aberdeen we get plenty of fog so there can be lots of delays in the heliport.\u201d But earlier this year Dave and a team of amazing volunteers have been taking their therapets \u2013 or helipets as they\u2019re known \u2013 into the heliport to bring some light relief for passengers. \u201cThe therapets change the dynamic,\u201d says Dave, 61. \u201cPeople will maybe sit next to each who would maybe of never spoken and start talking about their dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with the staff, they get something out of it too. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that takes away the mundane.\u201d Dave and his partner Joyce Scott, love taking their therapets Cara and Lunna, both English pointers, to the heliport. \u201cIt has been such a success and we\u2019re keen to build on that,\u201d says Dave. The Canine Concern Scotland Trust are always looking for more therapets and volunteers.

The photo was taken in 2021.\n\nPsychotherapist Dr. Jenn Mann, MFT, has not treated either Belichick or Hudson. But based on her professional experience, her opinion was that the couple's issues would be \"unique\" given the 48-year age difference.\n\nIn 2023, Bill split from former TV host Linda Holliday, 60, after 16 years.\n\nLast November, he was caught shirtless on a Ring camera, standing outside Jordon's Massachusetts pad.\n\n\"This is a massive age gap, and that itself can create a unique set of problems,\" Mann told the U.S. Sun.\n\n\"If these two want to maintain this relationship for the long term, they will face enormous challenges.\n\n\"This is a guy who is in a very different phase of life, physically, emotionally, sexually than a 24-year-old woman.\n\n\"We do not know where Bill is in his sexual health life experience, but typically, as men get older, their testosterone drops.\n\n\"There would likely be challenges when it comes to performance.\n\n\"It becomes more difficult typically to get and maintain an erection, and so this is where Viagra and Cialis come in.\n\n\"Bill does not look to be in his tip-top best shape.\n\n\"This can create other health problems, so sex and these medications would be a challenge for him.\"\n\nMann further compared Bill with Jordon, who in her early 20s, is at peak health.\n\n\"Jordon's physical sexual period stage is very different,\" she said.\n\n\"Her libido is likely to be super healthy and in a good place if she is as healthy as she looks.\n\n\"She is physically fit, not just a 24-year-old sitting on the couch playing video games.\n\n\"This is someone used to training for long hours and likes strength, flexibility, and endurance.\n\n\"She might want to take a five-mile hike with her boyfriend and more.\n\n\"For Bill at 72, all these energetic things may not be an option.\"\n\nThe Nashville native's relationship with the philosophy graduate was first reported by TMZ a week ago.\n\nThe outlet said the NFL coach had signed Jordan's homework book on the February 2021 flight.\n\n\"Jordan, thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels! Bill Belichick,\" read the message.\n\nAccording to Mann, Bill's interest in his new partner's college coursework might be short lived.\n\n\"He might have been interested in her philosophy studies and education, but this might not be enough to sustain it all,\" she said.\n\n\"Typically, in any relationship with or without an age gap, most people enjoy learning about different things from their partner.\n\n\"Studies show that most people benefit from this in the early stages of a relationship.\n\n\"These two may enjoy sharing knowledge like her philosophy and turning each other on to new experiences, restaurants, and games.\n\n\"Her philosophy studies may have been very intriguing for him.\n\n\"Here is this young woman who is studying something very intellectual that is very different than the world that he comes from\n\n\"She also understands his world because she's a cheerleader, and you can see how they are drawn to each other.\"\n\nThe former New Patriots coach has been one of the most successful.\n\nHis prolific career included six Super Bowl titles and coaching the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets.\n\nBill's personal life has not been so straightforward.\n\nHe married Debby Clarke Belichick in 1977 but split with her in 2006. The pair had three children.\n\nAfter meeting TV host Linda, they lived together in Massachusetts.\n\nShe served as the director of the Bill Belichick Foundation and Bill Warrior.\n\nMann suggested his younger new partner may make him feel youthful.\n\n\"When people get older, they might just think it is refreshing that a young woman is looking at them adoringly, is attracted to them, and is interested in him,\" she said.\n\n\"Bill may forget he's 72 years old and get to look and see a young face reflected at him.\n\n\"That can make him feel more youthful, like he is in a younger phase.\n\n\"But the reality is, he is in a very different phase of life in terms of his lifespan than she is.\"\n\nJordon is said to have become a professional cheerleader at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts.\n\nShe graduated two years ago and has already been seen on a trip to Croatia with Bill.\n\nMann said Jordon could need attention from a father figure.\n\n\"She is seeing a mature man,\" she said.\n\n\"But usually, younger women are drawn to much older men because of unresolved issues with their fathers.\n\n\"This could be a lack of attention, lack of love, someone not being there, or even someone being in the household but not present the way she might wish he was.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for her to have a male love figure who has a paternal feel and who adores and gives her attention.\n\n\"Sometimes it's a matter of healing old wounds from childhood, which is very common.\n\n\"She is seeing someone who is very successful in his field, financially stable and

In footage obtained by the Mail, he showed he is a true gentleman by opening the car door for his lady. Although, after some consideration, the former collegiate cheerleader decided not to get in.\n\nBelichick wore jeans and a light blue button-down shirt paired with brown loafers. Hudson looked youthful in flared, floral-print pants, a curve-hugging white tank and matching wedges.\n\nThey reportedly spent two hours at the private club before grabbing some ice cream. Belichick stayed in the car as Hudson grabbed their dessert -- potentially wanting to avoid causing commotion.\n\nTheir swanky dinner followed a romantic ride on Belichick's boat, which is named VIII Rings after how many Super Bowl championships he's clinched. They were seen on the $225,000 vessel earlier in the day Wednesday but were not photographed displaying any affection.\n\nThe pro football coach and Hudson's relationship was uncovered last week when the latter's former teammate told TMZ they began dating after meeting on a plane in 2021. They allegedly hit it off over a discussion about logic -- after which he signed her homework and they exchanged numbers.\n\nTheir friendship is reported to have turned romantic following Belichick's \"drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup\" with Linda Holliday.\n\nThey've become more comfortable making their relationship public, as Hudson attended Tom Brady's Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony this month with Belichick.\n\nThere have been a handful of clues about their relationship over the last year as well. The eight-time Super Bowl champion was seen at the 2024 Coastal At The Capitol Cheer and Dance event in March, where Hudson is believed to have competed.\n\nPlus, he made headlines last November after a Ring camera caught him leaving a Massachusetts home without a shirt.

The people are great, fishing, bike paths, the lighthouses, the beach, the history -- I mean it's got it all.\n\n'The baked goods there are pretty hard to resist, especially their muffins or cookies.'\n\nIt comes after DailyMail.com revealed footage of Belichick sneaking out of his girlfriend's home in 2023 - months before their relationship was revealed.\n\nLegendary quarterback Tom Brady mocked Ring footage of the football coach doing a bare-chested walk of shame at his roast in April.\n\nBelichick can be seen emerging from the property before walking down the front porch in the unearthed Ring doorbell footage\n\nThe pair were photographed together on Wednesday morning for the first time since their relationship was revealed, enjoying a day on the water on the New England island of Nantucket\n\nHudson, a former cheerleader 48 years Belichick's junior, was dressed casually in a black boatneck top, white belted lace shorts, and sandals\n\nBrady, who joked about his beloved coach doing the walk of shame on his Netflix roast, seemingly had no clue the home belonged to Belichick's new girlfriend.\n\nSeemingly unbeknownst to Tom - and his Netflix audience of millions - Belichick, 72, has been dating Hudson since 2022 after the pair met on a flight from Boston to Florida in 2021, as reported by TMZ.\n\nThe pair are said to have bonded over a philosophy project that Hudson - a student-athlete as well as an entrepreneur - had been working on at the time.\n\nLegendary quarterback Tom Brady joked about his beloved coach doing the walk of shame at his Netflix roast in April, seemingly unaware that the home belonged to Belichick's new girlfriend\n\nOn Tuesday, the May-December couple were pictured in an unearthed selfie taken during their first encounter in February 2021, TMZ reported.\n\nThe two posed for a photo during their reported first meeting aboard a 2021 flight from Boston to Florida where Belichick reportedly struck up a conversation about the book she was reading.\n\nIt was on that flight that Belichick also purportedly autographed a 'Deductive Logic' textbook that Hudson, then a 21-year-old student at Bridgewater State University, was studying.\n\nBoth had been keeping their relationship under wraps after his long-drawn-out break up with his ex-girlfriend Lisa Holliday.\n\nThe Ring footage, believed to be from November last year shows the New Haven legend shirtless, opening the front door of Hudson's $800,000 Massachusetts property in the early hours of the morning.\n\nBelichick, who has won a total of eight Super Bowls, grimaced at his former star player and looked uncomfortable during the show.\n\nThe pair boarded Belichick's powerboat, VIII Rings, aptly named after his eight NFL Super Bowl Championships with the New England Patriots\n\nReports of the May-December relationship emerged last week. Neither Belichick nor Hudson have addressed their romance publicly\n\nUntil September, Belichick had been in a relationship with 60-year Linda Holliday (left) for 16 years\n\nHe spent 23 seasons as head coach of the New England Patriots, taking charge of the team in the same year his current girlfriend was born.\n\nNeither Belichick nor Hudson have commented on their relationship, though she attended Brady's Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony this week.\n\nBelichick was spotted rooting her on at a cheerleading competition in March, and posed for a picture with her during a work trip to Croatia on a boat.\n\nThe couple kept in touch after their airline meet cute, discussing the former Bridgewater State University student's schoolwork and cheerleading routines.\n\nThey initially kept things lowkey and were only briefly spotted on rare occasions, but TMZ claims Hudson secretly visited Gillette Stadium to support her man during the 2022 and 2023 seasons with the Patriots.\n\nHudson is even understood to have been helping Belichick with his business endeavors of late.\n\nPage Six broke the news that the all-time great NFL coach - who called time on his legendary Patriots tenure earlier this year - had broken up with Holliday last September after a drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup for nearly a year.'\n\nAfter bidding an emotional goodbye to the Patriots, Belichick failed to land another NFL job ahead of the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe is instead set to become a regular fixture on ESPN's Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli Manning, before potentially returning to coaching when a vacancy opens up.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ever since the reports emerged, the dynamics of the relationship have been the talking point across the internet. From fans to sports analysts, everyone has had their say so far. However, ace broadcaster Shannon Sharpe has had the best take so far with his hilarious one-liner on the relationship.\n\nDuring the latest episode of the 'Nightcap' podcast, Unc and Ocho couldn't resist chiming in on the popular discourse around Bill Belichick's relationship with a younger woman. After Sharpe read the TMZ headline, Ocho wondered if the age gap was weird. In response, Unc argued that it's none of our business as long as it's okay for them.\n\nThe NFL veteran then took a shot at all those judging the couple for the age gap and urged them to be honest with themselves and look at the transactional nature of most relationships. He asked netizens to not take the high road and accept that a nurturer-provider dynamic exists in most relationships. But the epic one-liner that Sharpe used to express this philosophy is what took the cake.\n\n\"It's gotta be okay for them. I don't lose no sleep either way,\" Sharpe said. \"Y'all make it seem like everybody goes into a relationship, regardless male or female, with the right intentions. Simple Ocho - Use me for the ride, I use you for the hide. As long as we getting something out of this, I am cool with it.\"\n\n\"Use me for the ride, I use you for the hide\" is a one-liner that looks like a lyric from an Ice Cube song. Safe to say, netizens loved Sharpe's one-liner and hence took to social media to react. See for yourselves:\n\nWhile most couldn't get over the epic one-liner, others pointed out the hypocrisy of Unc and Ocho's stance. Netizens noted that the duo were highly critical when reports first emerged of 22-year-old NBA star Jalen Green dating 39-year-old Draya Michelle; however, now that it's Belichick, they have turned a blind eye.\n\nRegardless of what one may feel about this relationship, at the end of the day, it's the couple's choice. Love as they say has no boundaries and it's encouraging to see that Belichick and Hudson are not letting the naysayers affect their dynamic.\n\nOn what can be termed a rare occasion, Bill Belichick, for the first time, was spotted publicly with Jordon Hudson since the reports of their relationship emerged. The rumored couple were spotted at Nantucket enjoying a boat ride, as reported by Page Six.\n\nThe duo was seen getting into 72-year-old Belichick's $225,000-worth boat named VII Rings. Observers near the boat noted that Belichick had his typical stern look on his face while he entered the boat with Hudson carrying a bag and a blanket.\n\nIt's delightful to see the couple taking small strides ahead despite the massive negative discourse online about their relationship.

Those qualities may have made him one of the great coaches of all time, but it's unclear how well they would translate to the world of marriage.\n\nFollowing the news that Bill, who is 72, is now dating a 24-year-old cheerleader, many wanted to better understand who Bill's ex-wife was. Here's what we know about their relationship and their almost 30-year marriage.\n\nBill and his ex-wife Debby Clarke were childhood sweethearts, and the two married in 1977. They had three children together: Two sons, Stephen and Brian, and a daughter, Amanda. Given how terse Bill is even when he's talking about work, it's perhaps not surprising that he doesn't spend too much time focused on his personal life when he's being interviewed by the press.\n\nBill and Debby divorced in 2006 after allegations surfaced that Bill had an affair with Sharon Shenocca, a former receptionist for the New York Giants who Bill had known when he was one of the team's coaches. According to The New York Post, who reported out the story at the time, Bill \"showered\" Sharon with expensive gifts and also gave her enough money to hire a maid for her New Jersey home.\n\nBecause of her ex-husband's low public profile (outside of football), Debby never had to worry too much about the media prying into the details of her life. Even so, she's gone even more off the radar in the years since their divorce, and now runs a tile business in Wellesley, Mass. called The Art of Tile & Stone. She's now 67 years old, and she went to Wellesley College just like Bill.\n\nBill, meanwhile, has made headlines for the first time in decades over his reported relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old former cheerleader who could very easily be Bill's granddaughter. This came after news that Bill had broken up from his long-time girlfriend Lauren Holliday in 2023. Bill and Jordon were spotted together in the earlier part of that year, though, before his breakup from Lauren had been reported.\n\nGiven the incredible age gap between Bill and his new girlfriend, there's been plenty of judgment going around on the internet of his latest relationship. Bill's on-the-field record is pretty close to unimpeachable, but plenty of people feel comfortable judging some of his decisions off the field in more recent years.", "source": {"uri": "distractify.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Distractify"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_allen@distractify.com", "name": "Joseph Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheerleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellesley_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellesley College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass (liturgy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/lTTC2ihlp/1200x628/bill-belichick-ex-wife-1-1718894259488.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669102", "eventUri": "eng-9669102", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

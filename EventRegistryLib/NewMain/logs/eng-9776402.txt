They must be punished,\" she said.\n\nThe premier made the remarks while handing over financial assistance to the families of 34 victims, including Rangpur's Begum Rokeya University student Abu Sayeed, who lost their lives in the violence, at the Gono Bhaban.\n\nHasina, also chief of the ruling Awami League, sought help of people in identifying the perpetrators. \"I need [your] help too. If you know anything, please tell us.\"\n\nShe emphasised that the government would not allow anyone to jeopardise the future of Bangladesh and its people. \"We will not allow anyone to play with the fate of Bangladesh, so I need all-out cooperation and assistance from you.\"\n\nHasina expressed her determination to prevent such criminal activities from recurring in the country. \"I don't know how to console you. But I can understand your pain,\" she said, addressing the grieving families.\n\nQuestioning the motives of the attackers, she asked, \"What was the fault of general public? Why they were killed and had to face immense suffering? Killing people to topple the government? How it is possible?\"\n\nWhile trying to console the victims' families, Hasina shared her own losses. \"... I am like you: an orphan who has lost parents and brothers. I understand your pain. I will be by your side.\"\n\nCondemning the brutality of the attacks, she remarked, \"Burning down everything is never acceptable. It is unthinkably brutal to hang a person after killing them. How can a Muslim hang the body of another Muslim? Those who are involved in these crimes will surely face trial.\"\n\nShe stressed the need for bringing the culprits to book to ensure the safety of the people. \"People cannot be protected unless they are tried.\"\n\nShe urged the victims' families to remain patient. \"I am with you as long as I live.\"\n\nPM VISITS BSMMU, POLICE HOSPITALS\n\nLater in the day, Hasina visited Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and Central Police hospitals to see those who were injured in the violence.\n\nShe went to the Central Police Hospital around 5:00pm after visiting BSMMU.

The young royal, 10, accompanied his father, Prince William, 41, to watch the final of the world's oldest club tournament and present the FA Cup to winners Manchester United, who celebrated a 2-1 win over Manchester City yesterday afternoon. The royal football fans looked smart in matching navy suits, white shirts and striped ties as they watched the action unfold between the two rivals on a warm Saturday. Prince George was certainly dressed for the part, wearing an identical outfit to the Prince of Wales. George has a longstanding history of taking fashion inspiration from his father, with the royal mirroring his father's looks since he was a young boy. Prince George has a longstanding history of taking fashion inspiration from his father's wardrobe, even as a little boy Yesterday, the 10-year-old swept his locks to one side, opting for a crisp white shirt with a navy suit jacket, trousers, and a striped tie. In 2015, a bashful Prince George arrived at Princess Charlotte's christening in an almost identical outfit to one Prince William wore to meet his newborn brother, Prince Harry, for the first time more than 30 years prior. George almost stole the show at his sister's christening and looked adorable in a white shirt and red shorts. Although the Prince of Wales's white shirt had slightly more embroidery, in every other respect, George's outfit, designed by Rachel Riley, was identical to William's. The young royal has also continued to look to his father's fashion style for outfits later in life. Stepping off a plane hand-in-hand with Prince William in Warsaw in 2017, Prince George's style bore an uncanny resemblance to his father's as a youngster. The little Prince, who kept close to his father as he made his way down the plane's stairs at Warsaw Chopin Airport in July that year, was in his trademark navy shorts, teamed with a checked shirt. The look was not a far cry from an outfit his father wore as he disembarked a private plane at Aberdeen Airport for a family summer holiday in 1984 when the Duke of Cambridge was the same age as George now. Prince George (right) mirrored his father's 1984 outfit to Princess Charlotte's christening back in 2015 Royal fans were quick to compare George's outfit during an official visit to Poland (left) with William's Aberdeen airport outfit in 1984 Prince George has adopted his father's look of smart casual attire (pictured during a visit to Cardiff in 2022) Royal fans were quick to notice that George donned an outfit in line with his father's style for his tenth birthday portrait (left) In June 2022, Prince George was the double of his father in a smart navy suit with matching brown shoes as he joined his parents for his first official engagement in Cardiff. Then eight-years-old, George met performers and crew involved in a special Platinum Jubilee Celebration Concert taking place within the grounds of the castle. Prince George was certainly dressed for the part, wearing an identical outfit to his father Prince William. And last year, royal fans were quick to notice the resemblance between Prince George and his father as a brand new photograph was shared to mark his 10th birthday. As per tradition, the image was shared by the Prince and Princess of Wales on July 22 - and their eldest child looked more grown up than ever before. George was dressed in a check shirt - thought to be part of his school uniform - paired with chinos and brown lace-up brown suede brogues that William also favours as a smart/casual look. And yesterday the royal father and son duo kept the tradition going by donning matching ensembles William looked animated as he watched the Emirates FA Cup Final match between Manchester City and Manchester United at Wembley Stadium William and George watched the action live from Wembley Stadium in North West London with 90,000 fans George continued the tradition of taking fashion inspiration from his father yesterday during the FA Cup final. The royal football fans looked smart in matching navy suits, white shirts and striped ties as they watched the dramatic clash in a packed Wembley Stadium. The father and son enjoyed the match alongside tens of thousands of fans from the Royal Box, and 10-year-old George looked animated as he experienced the highs and lows of the cup final. Chatting in the front row of the box, the father-and-son duo laughed together as the game started. George shared a sweet moment with his father as he smoothed back his styled hair and William whispered in his ear Before kick-off, the Prince of Wales walked onto the pitch to cheers from the crowd where the two teams were lined up. Prince George could be seen on his feet and cheering in the stands as he celebrated the scores among elated fans. Sitting alongside them in the box, Manchester United bosses Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Avram Glazer could be seen cheering wildly alongside legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

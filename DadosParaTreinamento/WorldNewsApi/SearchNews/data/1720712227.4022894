Gauff, a 20-year-old American who won the U.S. Open singles title last year, and Siniakova, who is from the Czech Republic, defeated Italians Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Court Philippe Chatrier. It was Gauff\u2019s third women\u2019s doubles final after losing championship matches at Roland Garros in 2022 and the U.S. Open in 2021. Gauff and Siniakova both kissed the Coupe Simonne Mathieu \u2014 the winners\u2019 trophy. \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm. Thank you, Katerina, for playing with me. We decided two days before the tournament to play together,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cThank you to the fans. I know 11:30 Sunday morning is early for most people. It\u2019s early for me.\u201d Paolini was also the runner-up in the singles final at Roland Garros to four-time champion Iga Swiatek on Saturday. Swiatek beat Gauff in the singles semifinal. \u201cThe last two weeks were very nice, very emotional,\u201d Paolini said. \u201cI have a lot of memories. I can\u2019t wait to be back.\u201d Siniakova owns a career Slam in women\u2019s doubles alongside partner Barbora Krejcikova and has won eight majors \u2014 including the French Open in 2018 and 2021. Errani also owns a career Slam in doubles alongside her former partner Roberta Vinci. The Italian pair won the French Open title in 2012 \u2014 the year Errani lost the singles final. \u201cIt\u2019s really special to be in this court again. I don\u2019t know how many more years I have to play. But it\u2019s always special to play these kinds of matches,\u201d the 37-year-old Errani said. \u201cIt will be special to play the Olympics here in this place. So I\u2019ll see you in one month.\u201d Paolini was playing in her first final in women\u2019s doubles. Errani\u2019s serve was broken twice in the first set, and Paolini stayed on the baseline to compensate in the 11th game. The tactic worked as Errani held serve. Gauff and Siniakova took the first set when Errani\u2019s volley at the net went long and raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set, with Paolini 0-30 down on her serve. The Italians fought back to 4-3 with a service game to follow, but Errani\u2019s serve was broken again and their momentum was lost. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "summary": "Delray Beach's own Coco Gauff won her first Grand Slam doubles title by teaming with Katerina Siniakova for the French Open trophy on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/06/09/coco-gauff-wins-her-first-grand-slam-doubles-title-at-the-french-open/", "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/France_Tennis_French_Open_74442.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:07:39", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.456}

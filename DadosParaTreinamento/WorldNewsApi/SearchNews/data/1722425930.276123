{"id": 243247412, "title": "Gavin James: \u2018The new songs are upbeat but not all happy, thank God\u2019", "text": "\u201cAll my mates are over there, they\u2019re writing songs and DJing,\u201d he says of his recent trip to the US. \u201cI went to see DJ Dillon Francis in Vegas. I was very happy that my [credit] cards got blocked, so I didn\u2019t end up doing any gambling. We went to the Yucca Valley, which was amazing \u2014 right next to Joshua Tree.\u201d One of his closest friends is multi-platinum songwriter, producer and musician Dan Dare, who is also known in musical circles as SLANG. The pair have collaborated on James\u2019s new album, which should be released towards the end of this year. \u201cWe write a lot of songs together. Previously, we wrote All For You. I jumped in on some sessions in America with him and other musicians,\u201d he says. \u201cI usually just write at home here with the dog.\u201d As a successful artist, James is no stranger to travel himself, although it is clear that he remains well rooted in Ireland, and north Dublin specifically. \u201cI used to live in Viking Road, Stoneybatter, and then we moved up to Ashington. I also went to London for a couple of years. My dad has just sent me a message [from Portugal on holiday] saying \u2018One euro pints!\u201d James aired some of his latest material at the recent Marquee gig in Cork. They seem to have gone down well: \u201cIt was great \u2014 such a buzz, such an energy. The tent is louder than it should be for that amount of people. When they sing along, one person sounds like 10, it\u2019s amazing. I tried loads of new songs. It\u2019s tricky placing them where you want to place them, but you can never do two in a row.\u201d The fresh tracks that he\u2019s been rolling out live have a rockier edge, which goes back to his love of heavy rock when he was growing up. \u201cThere are a lot more electric guitars and solos, so they are fun to play,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I used to be in Zeppelin tribute bands. I would try and do the solo from Since I\u2019ve Been Loving You and sing it at the same time \u2014 it was a f***ing nightmare.\u201d Recording for the new album took place in Black Mountain Studios near Dundalk and was \u201ca blast\u201d, he says. The album features past collaborators Alex \u2018Trombanjo\u2019 Borwick and Ollie Green, who produced Always for him. That song achieved \u2018diamond\u2019 status [above platinum] in Brazil after regularly being played in the hit TV series Pega Pega. New song White Noise, unveiled late last year, is a summery banger that he wrote with Green in London. It did concern me that this song would be an indicative of, dare I say it, a more optimistic sounding Gavin James. He quickly puts me at ease: \u201cWhite Noise is definitely a bit more upbeat, but there are definitely some sad as f**k songs on the album as well. They\u2019re not all really happy, thank God.\u201d No title has been decided for the new album. I asked him to give an insight into what we can expect. \u201cThere\u2019s loads of death metal stuff on it, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are definitely a few songs on it that are nothing like I\u2019ve done before.\u201d Speaking of new directions, I\u2019m curious to know if he would ever divert his songwriting in a more political direction. However, despite his love of Bob Dylan, he is uncertain if the would: \u201cIf it ever falls upon me to write something about politics, I will. So far, I\u2019ve never really delved into it too much but it may come to a point when it\u2019s too much in our lives to not write about that.\u201d He was one of a host of Irish musicians who boycotted the SXSW festival in Texas after the discovery of the arts festival\u2019s sponsorship by the US army. \u201cKneecap [from Belfast] were the first lads to cop it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s mental, because music and supporting war should not be side by side. Any music festival should not have an affiliation with anything that kills anyone. It\u2019s very f***ing strange for a music festival to sign up to that. Music should be about spreading peace.\u201d We go off on a brief tangent to chat about his secret recipe for perfect scrambled eggs (30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, bit of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, apparently) and his new tattoo, which his partner has mirrored \u2014 a Peter Pan hat on their wrists, dedicated to staying forever young. This accompanies his other forearm tattoos \u2014 one of them a lyric from a Counting Crows song, Color Blind, a band that his dad introduced him to as a kid. Back on message again, we discuss his upcoming gig at Trinity College on July 3. I inform him that he is playing Dublin on the same night as Fleetwood Mac legend Stevie Nicks, who is at the 3Arena. His response: \u201cAh, f**k off! B****cks \u2014 I am going on early.\u201d Northerner Ryan McMullan will be supporting him and Gavin is complimentary of the Co Down singer: \u201cI never played with Ryan before, but I remember seeing his video of the cover of Streets of New York [by The Wolfe Tones] \u2014 f***ing hell. He used to do that song in Temple Bar. He\u2019s incredible, I\u2019m buzzing about that.\u201d James will celebrate his 33rd birthday the same week as the Trinity show. He\u2019s in the mood for an after-party, but has his reservations \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll probably bring everyone back to the gaff after the gig.\u201d A decade after getting signed by major labels in the US and Europe, James seems to be in a great place. Last year, he signed a global deal with Sony Music Worldwide. Although I am delighted to hear that all is well in the world of Gavin James, it\u2019s good to know that another signature song about despair and loss isn\u2019t too far away. As Gavin agrees: \u201cYou gotta have some heartache there. They are the songs that are gonna fall out a lot easier. It\u2019s very hard to write a good, happy song\u201d. Gavin James plays the Trinity Summer Series on July 3 with Ryan McMullan. Gavin also is appearing at the Galway International Arts Festival on July 26 and is planning for a world tour in 2025", "summary": "<p>Gavin James touched down from LA only two days before we speak over Zoom and is fresh from a round of in-person TV and radio promos in Dublin for his upcoming tour. He sips on his red wine with the company of his beloved lurcher.

Now he only schedules seven for each shift as he scrambles to absorb a dramatic jump in labor costs after a new California law boosted the hourly wage for fast food workers on April 1 from $16 to $20 an hour.\n\n\"We kind of just cut where we can,\" he said. \"I schedule one less person, and then I come in for that time that I didn't schedule and I work that hour.\"\n\nCheng hopes the summer when business is traditionally brisk with students out of school and families traveling or spending more time eating out will bring a better profit that can cover the added costs.\n\nExperts say it's still too early to tell the long-term impact of the wage hike on fast food restaurants and whether there will be widespread layoffs and closures. Past wage increases have not necessarily led to job losses. When California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage previously to $15 compared to the federal level of $7.25 per hour, job growth continued, according to a University of California, Berkeley study.\n\nSo far, the industry has continued to show job growth. In the first two months after the law passed April 1, the industry gained 8,000 jobs, compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. No figures were available yet for June.\n\nJoseph Bryant, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, which pushed for the raise, said the industry has not only added jobs under the new law but \"multiple franchisees have also noted that the higher wage is already attracting better job candidates, thus reducing turnover.\"\n\nBut many major fast food chain operators say they are cutting hours and raising prices to stay in business.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,\" Juancarlos Chacon, an owner of nine Jersey Mike's in Los Angeles, said.\n\nA turkey sub for under $10? It's now $11.15. While customers are still coming in, he's seeing them cut back -- no drinks, no chips, no dessert.\n\nSince their core business is lunch, Chacon has been reducing staffing in the mornings and evenings. He's also cut a few part-time employees, going from 165 total to about 145.\n\nIt wasn't only entry-level workers that got a pay raise. Shift leaders, assistant managers, and everyone else up the ladder had to get raises too, and labor represents about 35% of his costs.\n\n\"I'm very nervous,\" Chacon said.\n\nAaron Allen, founder and CEO of a global restaurant consulting firm, said he's gotten panicked calls from California restaurant operators and suppliers that are still recovering from the COVID-19 lockdown. He predicts a growing divide between corporations like McDonalds that have money to invest in automation and reduce costs through \"menu reconfiguration, versus smaller, more regional chains that might go under or face a major reduction in stores.\"\n\nCheng said he has no plans to lay off any of his 250 Wendy's workers and instead has turned to cutting overtime and reducing the amount of workers on each shift. He also raised menu prices about 8% in January in anticipation of the law.\n\nStill he said his books show that he was $20,000 over budget for a two-week pay period.\n\nJot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the minimum wage bill, said businesses are simultaneously feeling the squeeze from rising rents and food costs.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25% overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" Condie said. \"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nJulieta Garcia, who's been at a Pizza Hut in Los Angeles for a little over a year, said she's now working five days instead of six. But that's not a bad thing, she said, since she can spend more time with her 4-year-old son. The extra money means she can pay her cellphone bill on time, instead of having to turn off service, and take her son to get his tonsils checked out, she said.\n\nHoward Lewis, a 63-year-old retiree who works at a Wendy's in Sacramento, said he has been investing his extra money.\n\n\"Today was payday and I bought $500 worth of stock,\" said Lewis. He's also helping his ex-wife fix the brakes on her car.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the hike was necessary to give the state's more than half a million fast food workers a living wage.\n\n\"We are a state that gives a damn about fast food workers -- who are predominantly women -- working two and a half jobs to get by,\" Newsom stated in his state-of-the-state address posted on social media.\n\nFor Enif Somilleda, a general manager at a Del Taco in Orange County, the raise has been a mixed bag. She used to have four people working per shift. She now only has two.\n\n\"Financially it has helped me,\" she said. \"But I have less people so I have to do a lot more work.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

She now only has two.\n\n\"Financially it has helped me,\" she said. \"But I have less people so I have to do a lot more work.\"\n\nLawrence Cheng, whose family owns seven Wendy's locations south of Los Angeles, stands for a photo outside his Wendy's restaurant in Fountain Valley, Calif., June 20, 2024.

Past wage increases have not necessarily led to job losses. When California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage previously to $15 compared to the federal level of $7.25 per hour, job growth continued, according to a University of California, Berkeley study.\n\nSo far, the industry has continued to show job growth.

It's now $11.15. While customers are still coming in, he's seeing them cut back -- no drinks, no chips, no dessert.\n\nSince their core business is lunch, Chacon has been reducing staffing in the mornings and evenings. He's also cut a few part-time employees, going from 165 total to about 145.\n\nIt wasn't only entry-level workers that got a pay raise. Shift leaders, assistant managers, and everyone else up the ladder had to get raises too, and labor represents about 35% of his costs.\n\n\"I'm very nervous,\" Chacon said.\n\nAaron Allen, founder and CEO of a global restaurant consulting firm, said he's gotten panicked calls from California restaurant operators and suppliers that are still recovering from the COVID-19 lockdown. He predicts a growing divide between corporations like McDonalds that have money to invest in automation and reduce costs through \"menu reconfiguration, versus smaller, more regional chains that might go under or face a major reduction in stores.\"\n\nCheng said he has no plans to lay off any of his 250 Wendy's workers and instead has turned to cutting overtime and reducing the amount of workers on each shift. He also raised menu prices about 8% in January in anticipation of the law.\n\nStill he said his books show that he was $20,000 over budget for a two-week pay period.\n\nJot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the minimum wage bill, said businesses are simultaneously feeling the squeeze from rising rents and food costs.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25% overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" Condie said. \"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nJulieta Garcia, who's been at a Pizza Hut in Los Angeles for a little over a year, said she's now working five days instead of six. But that's not a bad thing, she said, since she can spend more time with her 4-year-old son. The extra money means she can pay her cellphone bill on time, instead of having to turn off service, and take her son to get his tonsils checked out, she said.\n\nHoward Lewis, a 63-year-old retiree who works at a Wendy's in Sacramento, said he has been investing his extra money.\n\n\"Today was payday and I bought $500 worth of stock,\" said Lewis. He's also helping his ex-wife fix the brakes on her car.\n\nGov.

Now he only schedules seven for each shift as he scrambles to absorb a dramatic jump in labor costs after a new California law boosted the hourly wage for fast food workers on April 1 from $16 to $20 an hour.\n\n\"We kind of just cut where we can,\" he said. \"I schedule one less person, and then I come in for that time that I didn't schedule and I work that hour.\"\n\nRELATED: $20 minimum wage goes into effect for California fast food workers\n\nCheng hopes the summer when business is traditionally brisk with students out of school and families traveling or spending more time eating out will bring a better profit that can cover the added costs.\n\nExperts say it's still too early to tell the long-term impact of the wage hike on fast food restaurants and whether there will be widespread layoffs and closures. Past wage increases have not necessarily led to job losses. When California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage previously to $15 compared to the federal level of $7.25 per hour, job growth continued, according to a University of California, Berkeley study.\n\nSo far, the industry has continued to show job growth. In the first two months after the law passed April 1, the industry gained 8,000 jobs, compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. No figures were available yet for June.\n\nJoseph Bryant, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, which pushed for the raise, said the industry has not only added jobs under the new law but \"multiple franchisees have also noted that the higher wage is already attracting better job candidates, thus reducing turnover.\"\n\nSUGGESTED: California businesses exempt from $20 minimum wage hike\n\nBut many major fast food chain operators say they are cutting hours and raising prices to stay in business.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,\" Juancarlos Chacon, an owner of nine Jersey Mike's in Los Angeles, said.\n\nA turkey sub for under $10? It's now $11.15. While customers are still coming in, he's seeing them cut back -- no drinks, no chips, no dessert.\n\nSince their core business is lunch, Chacon has been reducing staffing in the mornings and evenings. He's also cut a few part-time employees, going from 165 total to about 145.\n\nIt wasn't only entry-level workers that got a pay raise. Shift leaders, assistant managers, and everyone else up the ladder had to get raises too, and labor represents about 35% of his costs.\n\nSUGGESTED: Prices at California Chipotle, McDonald's and other fast-food chains are rising following minimum wage hike\n\n\"I'm very nervous,\" Chacon said.\n\nAaron Allen, founder and CEO of a global restaurant consulting firm, said he's gotten panicked calls from California restaurant operators and suppliers that are still recovering from the COVID-19 lockdown.

Staff who work at Wendy's, Pizza Hut, Del Taco and Jersey Mike's in the state are all getting fewer hours or days. Franchisees who run the outlets echo that - saying they have had to cut staff hours or cut the total number of staff on the books, or both. One has cut staff by 20.\n\nThe report by the Associated Press comes a month after a trade group said nearly 10,000 fast food jobs have been cut in California since the law came into effect on April 1. Unions disputed the figures. For Enif Somilleda, a general manager at a Del Taco in Orange County, the raise has been a mixed bag. She used to have four people working per shift. She now only has two. 'Financially it has helped me,' she said. 'But I have less people so I have to do a lot more work.'\n\nLawrence Cheng, whose family owns seven Wendy's locations south of Los Angeles , told AP he used to have nearly a dozen employees on the afternoon shift at his Fountain Valley location in Orange County. Now he only schedules seven for each shift as he scrambles to absorb a dramatic jump in labor costs after the hourly wage for fast food workers rose from $16. 'We kind of just cut where we can,' he said. 'I schedule one less person, and then I come in for that time that I didn't schedule and I work that hour.'\n\nExperts say it's still too early to tell the long-term impact of the wage hike on fast food restaurants and whether there will be widespread layoffs and closures. Past wage increases have not necessarily led to job losses. When California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage previously to $15 compared to the federal level of $7.25 per hour, job growth continued, according to a University of California, Berkeley study.\n\nThe two opposing sides - the unions that pushed for the raise and the restaurants - fought over the increase and are now doing the same over its impact. Joseph Bryant, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, which pushed for the raise, said the industry has not only added jobs under the new law but 'multiple franchisees have also noted that the higher wage is already attracting better job candidates, thus reducing turnover.' But many major fast food chain operators say they are cutting hours and raising prices to stay in business.\n\nAnd a trade group for the state The California Business and Industrial Alliance (CABIA) says almost 10,000 positions across chains from Pizza Hut to Burger King have been cut since the law came into effect on April 1. On top of that, chains have been shuttering restaurants - including Mexican chain Rubio's Coastal Grill, which this week filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed 48 locations in the state. 'I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,' Juancarlos Chacon, an owner of nine Jersey Mike's in Los Angeles, said.\n\nA turkey sub for under $10? It's now $11.15. While customers are still coming in, he's seeing them cut back - no drinks, no chips, no dessert. Since their core business is lunch, Chacon has been reducing staffing in the mornings and evenings. He's also cut a few part-time employees, going from 165 total to about 145. It wasn't only entry-level workers that got a pay raise. Shift leaders, assistant managers, and everyone else up the ladder had to get raises too, and labor represents about 35 percent of his costs.\n\n'I'm very nervous,' Chacon said. Aaron Allen, founder and CEO of a global restaurant consulting firm, said he's gotten panicked calls from California restaurant operators and suppliers that are still recovering from the COVID-19 lockdown. He predicts a growing divide between corporations like McDonald's that have money to invest in automation and reduce costs through 'menu reconfiguration, versus smaller, more regional chains that might go under or face a major reduction in stores.'\n\nCheng said he has no plans to lay off any of his 250 Wendy's workers and instead has turned to cutting overtime and reducing the amount of workers on each shift. He also raised menu prices by about 8 percent in January in anticipation of the law. Still he said his books show that he was $20,000 over budget for a two-week pay period. Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the minimum wage bill, said businesses are simultaneously feeling the squeeze from rising rents and food costs. 'When labor costs jump more than 25 percent overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,' Condie said.\n\n'They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.' Julieta Garcia, who's been at a Pizza Hut in Los Angeles for a little over a year, said she's now working five days instead of six. But that's not a bad thing, she said, since she can spend more time with her four-year-old son. The extra money means she can pay her cellphone bill on time, instead of having to turn off service, and take her son to get his tonsils checked out, she said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the hike was necessary to give the state's more than half a million fast food workers a living wage. Howard Lewis, a 63-year-old retiree who works at a Wendy's in Sacramento, said he has been investing his extra money. 'Today was payday and I bought $500 worth of stock,' said Lewis. He's also helping his ex-wife fix the brakes on her car.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Past wage increases have not necessarily led to job losses. When California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage previously to $15 compared to the federal level of $7.25 per hour, job growth continued, according to a University of California, Berkeley study.\n\nSo far, the industry has continued to show job growth. In the first two months after the law passed April 1, the industry gained 8,000 jobs, compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. No figures were available yet for June.\n\nJoseph Bryant, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, which pushed for the raise, said the industry has not only added jobs under the new law but \"multiple franchisees have also noted that the higher wage is already attracting better job candidates, thus reducing turnover.\"\n\nBut many major fast food chain operators say they are cutting hours and raising prices to stay in business.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,\" Juancarlos Chacon, an owner of nine Jersey Mike's in Los Angeles, said.\n\nA turkey sub for under $10? It's now $11.15. While customers are still coming in, he's seeing them cut back -- no drinks, no chips, no dessert.\n\nSince their core business is lunch, Chacon has been reducing staffing in the mornings and evenings. He's also cut a few part-time employees, going from 165 total to about 145.\n\nIt wasn't only entry-level workers that got a pay raise. Shift leaders, assistant managers, and everyone else up the ladder had to get raises too, and labor represents about 35% of his costs.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I'm very nervous,\" Chacon said.\n\nAaron Allen, founder and CEO of a global restaurant consulting firm, said he's gotten panicked calls from California restaurant operators and suppliers that are still recovering from the COVID-19 lockdown. He predicts a growing divide between corporations like McDonalds that have money to invest in automation and reduce costs through \"menu reconfiguration, versus smaller, more regional chains that might go under or face a major reduction in stores.\"\n\nCheng said he has no plans to lay off any of his 250 Wendy's workers and instead has turned to cutting overtime and reducing the amount of workers on each shift. He also raised menu prices about 8% in January in anticipation of the law.\n\nStill he said his books show that he was $20,000 over budget for a two-week pay period.\n\nJot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the minimum wage bill, said businesses are simultaneously feeling the squeeze from rising rents and food costs.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25% overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" Condie said. \"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nJulieta Garcia, who's been at a Pizza Hut in Los Angeles for a little over a year, said she's now working five days instead of six. But that's not a bad thing, she said, since she can spend more time with her 4-year-old son. The extra money means she can pay her cellphone bill on time, instead of having to turn off service, and take her son to get his tonsils checked out, she said.\n\nHoward Lewis, a 63-year-old retiree who works at a Wendy's in Sacramento, said he has been investing his extra money.\n\n\"Today was payday and I bought $500 worth of stock,\" said Lewis. He's also helping his ex-wife fix the brakes on her car.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the hike was necessary to give the state's more than half a million fast food workers a living wage.\n\n\"We are a state that gives a damn about fast food workers -- who are predominantly women -- working two and a half jobs to get by,\" Newsom stated in his state-of-the-state address posted on social media.\n\nFor Enif Somilleda, a general manager at a Del Taco in Orange County, the raise has been a mixed bag. She used to have four people working per shift. She now only has two.\n\n\"Financially it has helped me,\" she said. \"But I have less people so I have to do a lot more work.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He predicts a growing divide between corporations like McDonalds that have money to invest in automation and reduce costs through \"menu reconfiguration, versus smaller, more regional chains that might go under or face a major reduction in stores.\"\n\nCheng said he has no plans to lay off any of his 250 Wendy's workers and instead has turned to cutting overtime and reducing the amount of workers on each shift. He also raised menu prices about 8% in January in anticipation of the law.\n\nStill he said his books show that he was $20,000 over budget for a two-week pay period.\n\nJot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the minimum wage bill, said businesses are simultaneously feeling the squeeze from rising rents and food costs.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25% overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" Condie said. \"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nJulieta Garcia, who's been at a Pizza Hut in Los Angeles for a little over a year, said she's now working five days instead of six. But that's not a bad thing, she said, since she can spend more time with her 4-year-old son. The extra money means she can pay her cellphone bill on time, instead of having to turn off service, and take her son to get his tonsils checked out, she said.\n\nHoward Lewis, a 63-year-old retiree who works at a Wendy's in Sacramento, said he has been investing his extra money.\n\n\"Today was payday and I bought $500 worth of stock,\" said Lewis. He's also helping his ex-wife fix the brakes on her car.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the hike was necessary to give the state's more than half a million fast food workers a living wage.\n\n\"We are a state that gives a damn about fast food workers -- who are predominantly women -- working two and a half jobs to get by,\" Newsom stated in his state-of-the-state address posted on social media.\n\nFor Enif Somilleda, a general manager at a Del Taco in Orange County, the raise has been a mixed bag. She used to have four people working per shift. She now only has two.\n\n\"Financially it has helped me,\" she said. \"But I have less people so I have to do a lot more work.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The higher minimum wage, which went into effect in April, has forced him to slash 20 part-time staffers, from 165 to 145 -- as well as reduce staff hours.\n\nHe has also had to raise the price of menu items -- something that many of his fast food rivals at McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger and In-N-Out have also done.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,\" Chacon told the Associated Press.\n\nCheng raised the prices at his Wendy's location by about 8% in January in anticipation of the higher labor costs from the law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25% overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" said Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association, which opposed the bill.\n\n\"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nThe new law has also led some beloved chains, like Rubio's California Grill, to shutter dozens of locations in the state because of higher labor costs, as The Post previously reported.\n\nNewsom has argued the pay bump was necessary to provide a living wage to the more than half a million fast food workers in California.\n\nFast food restaurants in the state added 8,000 jobs in the first two months after the law took effect compared to the same period in 2023, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNo figures were available yet for June.\n\n\"Multiple franchisees have noted that the higher wage is already attracting better job candidates, thus reducing turnover,\" said Joseph Bryant, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label":

This change has prompted franchise owners such as Lawrence Cheng who manages seven Wendy's locations near Los Angeles to reduce their staffing levels. Previously scheduling nearly twelve employees per shift Cheng now only schedules seven. To fill the gaps he personally works extra hours hoping that the upcoming busy summer season will help cover the increased labor costs. Despite concerns about possible job losses and closures California's fast food industry has seen growth. In the first two months after the wage hike the industry added 8,000 jobs compared to the same period last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Joseph Bryant from the Service Employees International Union mentioned that higher wages are attracting better job applicants and lowering turnover. However, some franchise owners like Juancarlos Chacon of Jersey Mike's have raised prices and reduced hours to manage their expenses. Chacon who oversees nine stores in Los Angeles has noticed customers scaling back on extras like drinks and desserts due to the higher prices.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom defended the wage increase stating it was necessary to provide a living wage for the state's fast food workers who are mostly women working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Workers like Julieta Garcia and Howard Lewis have seen positive changes. Garcia now works five days a week instead of six allowing her more time with her son while Lewis is using his extra earnings to invest in stocks and help his ex-wife. However, franchisees are concerned about long-term sustainability facing rising rents and food costs leading some to predict a divide between large corporations and smaller chains struggling to survive.\n\nREAD ALSO: NYC Food Insecurity: SNAP and Summer EBT Programs Aim to Aid 1.8 Million Residents\n\nFurthermore, the wage increase in California's fast food industry has sparked ongoing debate and concern among franchise owners and industry experts alike. While the state aims to support its fast food workers with a living wage many businesses are grappling with the immediate financial impacts. Lawrence Cheng and other franchise operators have responded by reducing staffing and increasing their own hours to manage rising labor costs. Despite initial job growth in the industry following the wage hike there are fears about the long-term implications including potential closures and job cuts. Experts like Aaron Allen CEO of a restaurant consulting firm predict a widening gap between large corporations capable of investing in automation and smaller regional chains struggling with increased operational expenses. Franchise owners such as Juancarlos Chacon of Jersey Mike's have already implemented price hikes and reduced staffing to cope with the higher wage mandate.", "source": {"uri": "davidsonian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Davidsonian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_phill@davidsonian.com", "name": "Robert Phill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Cheng", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Cheng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wendy's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(employment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (employment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Living wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jersey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720611", "eventUri": "eng-9720611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 232, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The new wage is among the highest in the county, surpassing even Washington, D.C.'s $17.50 minimum wage. While supporters touted the wage increase as a way to help struggling Californians, detractors warned that restaurant owners would respond by laying off workers, cutting their hours, or speeding up the already starting shift to automation.\n\nThe law went into effect in April, meaning that it's likely too early to tell what the ultimate effects of the law will be. However, a recent report from the Associated Press detailed concerns from several California fast food restaurant owners who say they've been forced to reduce hours and hike food prices.\n\n\"We kind of just cut where we can,\" Lawrence Cheng, whose family owns several Wendy's franchises told the A.P. \"I schedule one less person, and then I come in for that time that I didn't schedule and I work that hour.\"\n\nJuancarlos Chacon, who owns nine Jersey Mikes locations in Los Angeles told the A.P. that he's resorted to reducing staff, cutting his part-time workers by about 20 employees. He's also had to raise prices. A turkey sub, for example, that used to be under $10 now costs $11.15. As a result, the amount customers spend, he says, has been falling.\n\n\"I've been in the business for 25 years and two different brands and I never had to increase the amount of pricing that I did this past time in April,\" he told the A.P.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising that many business owners have resorted to laying off employees, raising prices, or reducing hours.\n\n\"When labor costs jump more than 25 percent overnight, any restaurant business with already-thin margins will be forced to reduce expenses elsewhere,\" Jot Condie, president and CEO of the California Restaurant Association told the A.P. \"They don't have a lot of options beyond increasing prices, reducing hours of operation, or scaling back the size of their workforce.\"\n\nAs these stories show, while large minimum wage increases are great for those who manage to stay employed, many employers simply can't afford to absorb the higher labor costs. They end up passing those costs onto the consumer by hiking prices or hiring fewer workers.

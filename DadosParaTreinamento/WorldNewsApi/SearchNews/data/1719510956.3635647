During a recent podcast appearance on Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald, Mullally, 65, said she and Offerman, 53, never had kids due to a lack of \u201can organic burning desire.\u201d The actors met in 2000 and have been married since 2003. Mullally referred to the situation as the \u201clast taboo\u201d from her generation and said that her mother, who \u201cwanted to have literally 10 children,\u201d would have been \u201cthrilled\u201d if her daughter had a child. Pointing out possible challenges potential parents could face when raising children, Mullally said, \u201cIf you\u2019re in a place financially where you can\u2019t afford to have your own life and feel like you\u2019re able to be creative, then that could make you a lot more resentful.\u201d The Will & Grace star clarified, however, that she isn\u2019t \u201canti-children,\u201d despite never starting a family. Mullally further noted that she met Offerman when she was 41, and he was 30. \u201cIt was a little late in the day for me to have kids,\u201d she admitted. And though Mullally said she and Offerman \u201cdid try, kind of the old-fashioned way\u201d to have children, she explained, \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d She also said that Offerman \u201chas never been traumatized about not having children.\u201d Mullally and Offerman met in 2000 while both appearing in the play The Berlin Circle. They got engaged in 2002 and wed the following September. Their careers have crossed paths several times, most notably in Parks and Recreation and Will & Grace.", "summary": "The pair have been married since 2003", "url": "https://people.com/megan-mullally-on-why-she-nick-offerman-didnt-have-kids-8652988", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/rUPTU8akH--etKlg7_gZ38Xq67w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x368:752x370)/Nick-Offerman-and-Megan-Mullally-arrive-at-the-43rd-Annual-Gracie-Awards-052324-6b9672fa51b843d3a8b9294e23aa1f63.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:00", "author": "Marina Watts", "authors": ["Marina Watts"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.24}

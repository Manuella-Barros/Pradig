This is not something they do lightly. What's more, for many of them, this is not the first time.\"\n\nIn addition to the displacement in and around the capital Port-au-Prince, the skyrocketing violence and effective siege imposed by armed groups has pushed ever greater numbers of people to flee to neighboring provinces. This has doubled the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Southern region from 116,000 to 270,000 in the last three months alone.\n\nNearly all those internally displaced are currently hosted by communities already struggling with overburdened social services and poor infrastructure, raising further concerns about tensions with the potential to spark further violence. This is particularly acute in southern areas already weakened by the 2021 earthquake, which are now hosting almost half of Haiti's internally displaced population.\n\nSince the end of February, movements of goods such as medicine and fuel between the capital and the provinces have been severely limited, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, two thirds of IDPs live in spontaneous sites with very limited access to basic services. Schools and learning institutions currently make up 39 of the 96 active displacement sites and host 61,000 people, severely limiting school attendance. Sustainable, decent employment opportunities, equal access to basic services, and access to education for both IDPs and host communities are urgently needed.\n\nIOM is continuing to monitor and respond to the needs of displaced and affected communities, working in collaboration with partners and local authorities to provide humanitarian assistance and support for durable solutions.

This is not something they do lightly. What's more, for many of them, this is not the first time.\"\n\nIn addition to the displacement in and around the capital Port-au-Prince, the skyrocketing violence and effective siege imposed by armed groups has pushed ever greater numbers of people to flee to neighboring provinces. This has doubled the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Southern region from 116,000 to 270,000 in the last three months alone.\n\nNearly all those internally displaced are currently hosted by communities already struggling with overburdened social services and poor infrastructure, raising further concerns about tensions with the potential to spark further violence. This is particularly acute in southern areas already weakened by the 2021 earthquake, which are now hosting almost half of Haiti's internally displaced population.\n\nSince the end of February, movements of goods such as medicine and fuel between the capital and the provinces have been severely limited, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, two thirds of IDPs live in spontaneous sites with very limited access to basic services. Schools and learning institutions currently make up 39 of the 96 active displacement sites and host 61,000 people, severely limiting school attendance. Sustainable, decent employment opportunities, equal access to basic services, and access to education for both IDPs and host communities are urgently needed.\n\nIOM is continuing to monitor and respond to the needs of displaced and affected communities, working in collaboration with partners and local authorities to provide humanitarian assistance and support for durable solutions. Since the end of February, the organization has provided nearly 5 million litres of clean water to some 25,000 people and rehabilitated 22 water hand pumps. More than 37,000 people have been provided with relief supplies including blankets, water containers, solar lamps, kitchen sets and plastic sheets.\n\nMobile clinics have been deployed to provide medical assistance for 18,000 people and psychosocial support has been made available, including through a free hotline.

These displaced individuals strain local communities already burdened by fragile social services and inadequate infrastructure, exacerbating tensions that could escalate violence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 earthquake, southern areas, now home to almost half of Haiti's IDPs, face acute challenges. Movement restrictions since February have worsened the situation, hindering essential goods like medicine and fuel from reaching affected areas.\n\nWithin Port-au-Prince, two-thirds of IDPs reside in makeshift camps lacking basic services, including schools where attendance is severely limited. Urgent needs include sustainable employment, equal access to services, and education for both displaced persons and host communities.\n\nIOM continues to respond by providing humanitarian aid, including five million liters of clean water, rehabilitation of water hand pumps, and relief supplies to over 37,000 individuals.

People Forced to Flee Their Homes Due to Surging Gang Violence", "body": "The relentless surge of Haiti gang violence has reached a critical juncture, with the latest report from the UN migration agency painting a grim picture of the situation.\n\nNearly 580,000 individuals have been displaced, underscoring the gravity of the crisis gripping this Caribbean nation, according to AP News.\n\nThe escalation of unrest, particularly evident since late February, has plunged Haiti deeper into turmoil, with armed Haiti gangs unleashing coordinated attacks and seizing control of vital infrastructure.\n\nPhilippe Branchat, head of the International Organization for Migration, minced no words in describing the dire consequences of escalating Haiti gang violence.\n\nHe attributed the surge in displacement to years of unchecked violence, culminating in the catastrophic events witnessed in February.\n\nThe number of displaced individuals, now exceeding 578,000, marks a distressing escalation from the figures reported merely three months prior.\n\nREAD NEXT: Gang Ambush Raises Haiti National Police Death Toll to 21\n\nThe surge in displacement stems primarily from residents fleeing the capital, Port-au-Prince, seeking refuge in other provinces.\n\nHowever, these areas lack the necessary resources to accommodate the influx of displaced individuals, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation, France 24 reports.\n\nThe political instability following the departure of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry has only deepened the crisis, leaving the nation grappling with uncertainty and unrest.\n\nThe ramifications of Haiti's escalating violence are nothing short of catastrophic.\n\nNearly 10% of the nation's population finds itself internally displaced, with close to 5 million individuals confronting acute hunger.\n\nThe failure to address the root causes of the violence has only worsened the situation, with necessities such as food and medical supplies becoming increasingly scarce, amplifying the suffering of the Haitian people.\n\nThe Haiti gang violence has not only uprooted thousands but has also disrupted critical supply routes, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis, Reuters noted.\n\nHaiti's heavy reliance on imports for food and fuel renders it particularly vulnerable, resulting in price surges and shortages of essential commodities.\n\nMoreover, the shuttering of businesses has further destabilized the economy, compounding the suffering of Haiti's populace.\n\nWhile daunting challenges persist, there are glimmers of hope on the horizon.\n\nThe recent appointment of a new acting prime minister and cabinet signals a commitment to addressing the crisis head-on.\n\nThe graduation of over 400 officers from the police academy represents a crucial step towards restoring order and quelling Haiti gangs' violence.\n\nHowever, international assistance and solidarity are indispensable in this critical moment as Haiti endeavors to chart a path toward stability and resilience.\n\nThe crisis engulfing Haiti shows no signs of abating, with nearly 580,000 individuals displaced amid escalating violence and instability.\n\nThe humanitarian fallout is staggering, with millions facing acute hunger and essential resources growing increasingly scarce.\n\nUrgent action is imperative to address the root causes of the crisis and provide vital support to those affected.\n\nAs Haiti navigates this turbulent chapter in its history, international solidarity and concerted efforts are indispensable in alleviating the suffering and fostering a sustainable path forward for the nation and its people.\n\nREAD MORE: Haiti Police Meet Kenya's Inspector General Before Deployment", "source": {"uri": "latinpost.com",

Three months later, a new government has just been installed but the Kenyan-led deployment has yet to land.\n\nHenry first requested the deployment in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the violence has cut off supply routes in a country highly dependent on imports of both food and fuel, pushing up prices for basic staples and medical supplies, while businesses have shuttered and alliances of armed gangs have attacked neighborhoods, bringing indiscriminate killings, sexual violence, ransom kidnappings, lootings and arson.\n\nThose displaced often flee with little more than the clothes on their back and often lose their jobs along with their homes. They have largely been traveling south and staying with host families, an additional burden for areas economically weakened by the devastating 2021 earthquake.\n\nMany are also staying in makeshift camps set up in schools and sport centers around the capital, where basic services are limited and the changing gang battle-lines can prevent aid workers from delivering food or force the displaced to flee yet again.\n\nNeighboring countries last year deported hundreds of thousands back to Haiti.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah Morland; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Henry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/79dcc54/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Ff6%2F6efd47e7eacab6bd766e0b28b53f8b%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5H0RR%3A12024-06-18T210028Z_1_LYNXMPEK5H0RR_RTROPTP_3_HAITI-VIOLENCE-DISPLACED.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662516", "eventUri": "eng-9662516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It covers the humanitarian situation in Port-au-Prince following the violence that broke out on 29 February. The report covers mainly the period from 7 to 14 June 2024.\n\nThe Grand Sud region, comprised of the Anse, Nippes, Sud and Sud-Est departments, has recorded an increase of 131 per cent in its displaced population in comparison to March 2024, leading to increased needs for both the displaced and host families, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The latest IOM data shows that practically all the IDPs (99.9%) live with host families. The 2024 HNRP had predicted that the region will emerge as a major humanitarian hotspot, after Port-au-Prince. OCHA is working with international and national partners to put greater focus on the area and scale up the response.\n\nAfter months of increases, food basket costs (for a household of 5) fell by 5 per cent nationwide in May 2024 compared to April 2024, the World Food Programme said in its latest market analysis. The main drivers of the price fall were cheaper fuel, early spring production, more imported food, and slight decrease in security concerns, facilitating goods transportation. The cost of the food basket in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area fell by 13 per cent compared with April. However, overall the food basket is still high at 28,068 HTG (approx. $207), up of 3% compared to December 2023. All departments saw a fall in cost, excepted the Northeast and the Centre, where it rose.\n\nEvents that regularly stress the country represent risk factors that negatively impact mental health and psychosocial well-being of the population, according to an IOM report on suicidal behavior in the Port-au-Prince area. Three initial factors were identified as having a particularly negative impact (direct and indirect) on the Haitian population: political, economic factors, and those related to natural disasters. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are the most exposed, expressing fears, anxiety, and significant inabilities to meet their basic needs. Front-line workers also testify to feelings of fear, lack of resources to manage stress, and helplessness at being confronted with the distress of those displaced. Recommendations included updating mental health policy and developing a national suicide prevention strategy; strengthening human resources; Optimizing intervention coverage.\n\nPrime Minister Gary Conille and his government and members of the Presidential Transition Committee met humanitarian actors, technical and financial partners on 13 June in Port-au-Prince to discuss the level of preparedness for the hurricane season, assess the state of pre-positioned stocks and examine the complementarity of resources between international partners and the government to ensure optimal preparedness and response. The Prime Minister called on humanitarian partners to support the Civil Protection Department (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Protection Civile) and strengthen coordination with the Government.", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nippes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nippes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud-Est_(department)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sud-Est (department)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sud-Est (department)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/previews/90/1f/901f0458-600b-4a83-8661-ac73b4d1f8e0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662516", "eventUri": "eng-9662516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-29", "textStart": 252, "textEnd": 263}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 2704, "textEnd": 2711}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Expressing grave concern over unprecedented violence, insecurity, and the humanitarian crisis, the independent experts made the following statement:\n\n\"Violence, particularly in the capital Port-au-Prince, has reached alarming levels, with armed groups controlling large areas and complicating humanitarian access. Clashes between gangs and the Haitian National Police have created a pervasive environment of fear, restricting freedom of movement and access to basic services. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, 2,500, including at least 82 children, have reportedly been killed or injured in gang-related violence. Reportedly, more than half a million children in Haiti are living in neighbourhoods controlled by armed groups, which puts them at higher risk of violence, and child recruitment.\n\nAccording to UN Migration (IOM), at the national level, 80 per cent of internally displaced persons are hosted by host families compared to 20 per cent residing in over 114 sites (including in schools, churches, and other public buildings) in Port-au-Prince, including in gang-controlled or high-risk areas. Many internally displaced persons are living in overcrowded and inadequate conditions without basic hygiene and sanitation, facing severe shortages of food, water, shelter, and medical care, including a lack of safe and private spaces for psychological support. These conditions heighten disease and violence risks, particularly gender-based violence. Furthermore, the growing number of internally displaced children who are unaccompanied renders them particularly vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and trafficking by gangs.\n\nThe protection crisis is severe, with sexual violence against women and girls in IDP sites surging as gangs use rape as a weapon of terror. Weaknesses in the justice system, attacks against justice personnel, and lack of police presence exacerbate the situation, leaving many victims without recourse. Nearly half the population suffers from severe food insecurity, with 18 per cent in a state of emergency. The resurgence of cholera and tuberculosis, compounded by fuel shortages, has strained the health system to the brink of collapse.\n\nThe ongoing violence has forced the closure of nearly 900 schools, affecting almost 200,000 children. Attacks on educational facilities have increased, disrupting learning and putting children at risk of exploitation by gangs.\n\nSince the reopening of Port-au-Prince International Airport on 20 May, operations have been limited, with significant backlogs and humanitarian supplies blocked at the port.\n\nWe welcome the recent inauguration of the National Emergency Operations Centre in Port-au-Prince, which is crucial for coordinating disaster preparedness and management following the heavy rains in the capital and the challenging hurricane season forecast for 2024.\n\nWe call for the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti to support the National Police and bring security to the Haitian people, under conditions that comply with international human rights norms and standards. We call for comprehensive training for the MSS mission, particularly on the protection of the population, including protection of children, and preserving distinction of humanitarian operations.\n\nThe current 21 per cent funding coverage for Haiti's 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan is insufficient to address the severe humanitarian crisis. There is an urgent need for increased humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies, menstrual and maternal health products, and shelter.\n\nWe call on donors, development partners and humanitarian actors to prioritise the protection of IDPs, both in identified and informal sites, including emergency assistance, cash assistance for service access, food distribution, counselling, referrals, and promoting social cohesion and resilience of both IDPs and host communities as well strengthening community-based organisations' protection capacity. Financial resources need to be mobilised to increase protection actors' intervention capacities around displacement sites to inform, refer, and assist victims promptly.\n\nAccess for humanitarian workers must be guaranteed, and protection mechanisms for IDPs, especially women, including older women, children, and vulnerable groups, must be strengthened. Efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence, abuse, and exploitation must be strengthened, focusing on prevention, risk mitigation, response services, and access to justice.\n\nAddressing the humanitarian crisis and protecting human rights are also necessary prerequisites to prepare for free elections; this effort requires the entire Haitian government and society, including private actors, with the support of the international community. Given the disproportionate impact of this crisis on women and girls, their leadership and meaningful participation in decision making is also critical to the successful political transition in Haiti.\n\nRebuilding security in neighbourhoods of origin for IDPs must be a top priority to address displacement causes and improve their situation. IDPs should be consulted in planning relocation projects or sustainable solutions impacting their lives. Durable solutions for IDPs, such as safe return, resettlement, or local integration, require addressing the root causes of displacement, including violence, political instability, and environmental degradation.\"", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_National_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haitian National Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toussaint Louverture International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cholera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662516", "eventUri": "eng-9662516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2805, "textEnd": 2811}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Attacks on educational facilities have increased, disrupting learning and putting children at risk of exploitation by gangs.\n\nSince the reopening of Port-au-Prince International Airport on 20 May, operations have been limited, with significant backlogs and humanitarian supplies blocked at the port.\n\nWe welcome the recent inauguration of the National Emergency Operations Centre in Port-au-Prince, which is crucial for coordinating disaster preparedness and management following the heavy rains in the capital and the challenging hurricane season forecast for 2024.\n\nWe call for the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti to support the National Police and bring security to the Haitian people, under conditions that comply with international human rights norms and standards. We call for comprehensive training for the MSS mission, particularly on the protection of the population, including protection of children, and preserving distinction of humanitarian operations.\n\nThe current 21 per cent funding coverage for Haiti's 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan is insufficient to address the severe humanitarian crisis. There is an urgent need for increased humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies, menstrual and maternal health products, and shelter.\n\nWe call on donors, development partners and humanitarian actors to prioritise the protection of IDPs, both in identified and informal sites, including emergency assistance, cash assistance for service access, food distribution, counselling, referrals, and promoting social cohesion and resilience of both IDPs and host communities as well strengthening community-based organisations' protection capacity. Financial resources need to be mobilised to increase protection actors' intervention capacities around displacement sites to inform, refer, and assist victims promptly.\n\nAccess for humanitarian workers must be guaranteed, and protection mechanisms for IDPs, especially women, including older women, children, and vulnerable groups, must be strengthened. Efforts to prevent and respond to sexual violence, abuse, and exploitation must be strengthened, focusing on prevention, risk mitigation, response services, and access to justice.\n\nAddressing the humanitarian crisis and protecting human rights are also necessary prerequisites to prepare for free elections; this effort requires the entire Haitian government and society, including private actors, with the support of the international community. Given the disproportionate impact of this crisis on women and girls, their leadership and meaningful participation in decision making is also critical to the successful political transition in Haiti.\n\nRebuilding security in neighbourhoods of origin for IDPs must be a top priority to address displacement causes and improve their situation. IDPs should be consulted in planning relocation projects or sustainable solutions impacting their lives. Durable solutions for IDPs, such as safe return, resettlement, or local integration, require addressing the root causes of displacement, including violence, political instability, and environmental degradation.\"\n\n/Public Release.

The force has remained woefully underfunded and ill-equipped, despite being at the forefront of the battle against powerful armed gangs in the Caribbean country.\n\nConille himself was installed by a transitional council in May after gangs earlier this year seized large swaths of the capital, Port au Prince, and deposed former Prime Minister Ariel Henry.\n\nSpeaking to the Reuters news agency after the change was announced on Friday, Pierre Esperance, the National Network for Defense of Human Rights (RNDDH), described Elbe's time as head of the police as \"catastrophic.\"\n\n\"The results of Elbe at the helm of the police are catastrophic,\" Esperance said, adding he believed Elbe should be prosecuted.\n\n\"He spent his whole time establishing relationships with the gangs, reinforcing the gangs and preventing cops from doing their job and risking their lives,\" he said.\n\nHaiti's police unions have also repeatedly called for Elbe's resignation and arrest, pointing to gang raids on at least 30 police stations and substations in recent months as part of a series of attacks that began on February 29.\n\nOn Wednesday, the SPNH-17 police union held a news conference condemning the state of the department under Elbe. SYNAPOHA, another police union, joined in calling on Conille to bolster the department earlier this week.\n\nThe latest development has come as Haiti continued to await the deployment of a Kenya-led, UN-backed multinational security force composed of 1,000 Kenyan officers, as well as personnel from a handful of Caribbean countries.\n\nThat force was meant to deploy in late May, but its arrival has been repeatedly delayed.\n\nFor his part, Normil had headed the national police from mid-2019 to late 2020 under former President Jovenel Moise, who was assassinated in 2021.\n\nPrior to that, he oversaw the detective division. The effective date of the replacement was not immediately clear.\n\nFight against gang violence\n\nHaiti's fast-shrinking police force has suffered from a lack of resources while fighting criminal groups armed with high-calibre weapons the UN says are largely trafficked from the nearby US.\n\nAs of 2023, the police force had just more than 13,200 personnel, according to the UN. The international organisation has warned that only about 4,000 police are on duty at any given time in a country of 11 million.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent survey by RNDDH found that 20 police officers have been killed so far this year, with more than 320 since 2015.\n\nPolice officers' regular complaints included late pay, insufficient training, workplace harassment, dismissal threats, knife and gunshot injuries and equipment shortages.\n\nNevertheless, Haiti's new Conille-led government has promised to bring about change.\n\n\"Haiti is confronted by major challenges. Violence and instability paralyse our daily lives,\" Conille said at an official ceremony on Wednesday.\n\n\"My government will work without rest to improve the conditions of each and every Haitian,\" he said, adding that \"without security, no sustainable progress can be achieved.\"\n\n\"It is crucial our police and soldiers are ready to face today's security challenges,\" Conille added, \"and we will ensure that they have the tools they need to carry out their mission effectively and professionally.\"\n\nFor its part, Haiti's ombudsman, the Citizens' Protection Office, has called on Normil to produce a plan to control the gangs and improve the police force \"without delay.\"\n\nIt has also called for authorities to offer explanations for the high rate of killings and the \"spectacular\" recent escape of about 4,500 prisoners under the \"complete indifference\" of previous authorities.\n\nGang violence in Haiti has pushed 578,000 people from their homes, according to the UN's latest estimates. Thousands have been killed and millions pushed into acute hunger amid the unrest.

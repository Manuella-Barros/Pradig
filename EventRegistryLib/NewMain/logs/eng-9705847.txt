He demanded a detailed probe into the incident and action against those responsible for it.\n\nDistrict officials said the child's parents disposed of the dead snake after photographing it and sent the image to the local Anganwadi sevika (worker). But despite this, the food sample from the packet has been collected and sent to a laboratory for testing, they said.\n\n\"Children in the age group of six months to three years receive packets of mid-day meal, a premix of dal khichadi, at Anganwadis. These packets are distributed to families once they arrive at the Anganwadi. On Monday, meal packets were distributed by Anganwadi workers in Palus. The parents of one child claimed that a tiny dead snake was found in the packet they received,\" Bhosale said on Wednesday.\n\nThe parents took a photo of the snake and sent it to the Anganwadi sevika, she said. \"But by the time the sevika forwarded the photo to our district sevika group, the parents had already disposed of the suspected dead snake,\" she said.\n\nBhosale added that the issue was raised during a meeting held on July 2, and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Sangli Zilla Parishad, Sandip Yadav, who heads the Women and Child Welfare and Anganwadi section, was informed. She said the godown where the meal packets are stored was reportedly sealed following the incident.\n\nBhosale also claimed that there have been complaints about the contractor responsible for supplying the premixed meal packets.

Harsh punishment should be taken against the guilty.\"", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anganwadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Network packet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangli", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sangli"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sangli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-07%2F909e14bc-4086-4648-88c9-ac49e90ac250%2FiStock_638525806.jpg?rect=0%2C20%2C1064%2C559&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705847", "eventUri": "eng-9705847", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 706, "textEnd": 712}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

This time again, one of the Anganwadi centres on Sinhgad Road is making headlines as worms were found in the food packets.\n\nKids aged from six months to three years are given food packets of moong dal khichdi premix from the government under the mid-day meal scheme. However, the food packets which were distributed in one of the Anganwadi centres on Sinhgad Road were found to be of bad quality. Worms were found in the khichdi mix.\n\nArchana Navgire, a relative of a kid, who found the worms in the food packet, voiced her concern on X (formerly Twitter) and also reached the authorities regarding the matter.\n\n\"My nephew is enrolled in an Anganwadi at Sinhgad Road and kids are susceptible and can fall sick after consuming the expired food material. The packets of these foods had an expiry date of 120 days but when we opened the packets they had worms and were not fit to consume. We want the authorities to take strict action against those responsible for distributing expired food packets,\" Navgire said.\n\nSandeep Kale, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) leader, wrote a letter to the Divisional Deputy Commissioner, Women and Child Development Department and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notifying the authorities that the food packets given by the government under the mid-day meal scheme to the kids are of poor quality and are not fit to consume.\n\nThe letter reads, \"The food given to children is unfit and can't be consumed. The authorities are playing with the lives of young children. Who will take responsibility if a child gets poisoned or dies? The concerned contractor's license should be terminated, all the packets given to the Anganwadi centres should be recalled and an order should be given immediately that the distributed packets should not be used. If no strict action is taken, we will hold the commissioner responsible for any mishap. We urge the authorities to take strict action against the contractor.\"\n\nOn the condition of anonymity, a worker from the centre said, \"The khichdi that the government distributes is spicy as it's premixed and we can't feed that to a six-month-old child. The Anganwadi workers and concerned parents even voiced this concern to the heads but nothing has been done. Nobody takes this khichdi. And if we can keep good food then obviously student strength will also increase and there will be no case of malnutrition.\"\n\nRupali Khapre, FDA inspector, said, \"We collected the samples and have sent them to the labs, and Suresh Annapure, joint commissioner, FDA, Pune division, will take the call on this matter.\"\n\nThe Free Press Journal tried to contact Annapure, but couldn't get a response.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anganwadi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anganwadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi_(dish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khichdi (dish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mung_bean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mung bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Press_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Free Press Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_division", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pune division"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune division"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Vegetarianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Vegetarianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-07/aa009c46-45b5-4c79-95a7-4a0efed6152b/Screenshot_2024_07_02_170822.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705847", "eventUri": "eng-9705847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

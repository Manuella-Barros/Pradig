For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBusiness Do US fast-food customers want plant-based meat?

For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFood & Cooking Do US fast-food customers want plant-based meat?

For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nFood-drink Do US fast-food customers want plant-based meat? Panda Express thinks so, but McDonald's has doubts DEE-ANN DURBIN Associated Press\n\nThe strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor's, while the salad has been left behind.\n\nAnother menu item that's not coming to McDonald's any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald's tested a few years ago.\n\n\"I don't think the US consumer is ... looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald's now,\" Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \"it's a trend that we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nFast food chains launch 'value menu' war after cost complaints.

Olive Garden isn't one of them. Here's why\n\nRather than vie for customers with steep discounts, Olive Garden is planning to bring people in by highlighting its regular offerings. One example? Refills for soup or salad and breadsticks.\n\nStarbucks joins the value menu wars with a new $5 and $6 deals\n\nThe coffee chain rolled out a new \"Pairings Menu,\" which combines a drink and a breakfast item for a discount.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor's, while the salad has been left behind.\n\nAnother menu item that's not coming to McDonald's any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald's tested a few years ago.\n\n\"I don't think the US consumer is ... looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald's now,\" Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \"it's a trend that we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

McDonald's whole thing is that it is not some beacon of health. People are showing up for an affordable, decent burger accompanied by some (hopefully) affordable, decent fries. No one walks up to the golden arches jazzed that they're about to make a super great choice for their body.\n\n\"You go to McDonald's for a cheap, craveable quick bite, not a healthy, more expensive item,\" said Darren Tristano, the CEO and founder of Foodservice Results, a food-industry consultancy. A higher-quality alternative may get tossed on the menu so that if people are going out to eat in a group, there's an option for a health-conscious person in the mix, preventing their veto, he said. \"But ultimately you're not going to see a group of kids going there and buying four plant-based burgers.\"\n\nIn general, McDonald's is exceptionally good at scaling an established trend and bringing it to the masses, said Danilo Gargiulo, a senior research analyst at AB Bernstein. But it's not really a trendsetter or an innovative company. If you consider the extent to which plant-based meat has failed to take off in the US, it makes sense that it would be a flop at McDonald's, too. Beyond Meat, which partnered with McDonald's on the McPlant, earlier this year revealed a turnaround plan to try to revive its brand, including cutting at least $70 million in costs. Its rival Impossible Foods has undertaken multiple rounds of layoffs over the past couple of years.\n\nThe issue with salads isn't that they're not popular in the US -- it's that there are plenty of places to get them that aren't McDonald's. There's no good reason to get your roughage from the same place that makes the Grimace Shake when you can go to Sweetgreen, Cava, or Panera. Or you can just spin something up from ingredients you got at the grocery store, reserving your McDonald's trip for when you're in the mood for a treat.\n\nConsumers give restaurants a sort of permission to offer certain items. At McDonald's, diners are on board with breakfast sandwiches and Big Macs; they're not so on board with a mediocre salad.\n\n\"They will only give you credit for the things they think you can produce,\" Tristano said. \"You're not going to see an eggs Benedict at McDonald's.\"\n\nOver the years, McDonald's has been able to fold in some noncore items -- namely, coffee and chicken. But that makes sense. Coffee, including specialty coffee, is already popular. McDonald's has had regular drip coffee available for decades, but it didn't open its first McCaf\u00e9 until 1993, in Australia. The first McCaf\u00e9 in the US opened in Chicago in 2001.\n\nMcDonald's developed chicken nuggets in the 1970s and added them to the menu in 1983. It put the McChicken sandwich on the menu in 1980, later pulled it because of poor performance, and then put it back on again after the success of the nuggets. Today, McDonald's is selling as much chicken as it is beef, if not more, doing $25 billion in chicken sales annually. Still, it's the crispy chicken and the nuggets that are going gangbusters, not the leaner grilled chicken, which it also pulled from menus across the US during the pandemic.\n\nIt's not just consumer demand that's keeping McDonald's menu limited to the more-traditional, less-than-body-boosting items -- it's its franchisees, too. It doesn't want to have to offer items they have a hard time selling, let alone put in the investment to make them. Keeping the menu limited helps them serve faster and keep costs down.\n\nIn the landscape of fast food, McDonald's is unique and it isn't. Tristano said Wendy's, for example, hasn't had much success in expanding its menu beyond chili, which it can use its leftover meat to create, though it does have salad. Gargiulo said Burger King had done a little better on some fronts because in its DNA is a focus on a little higher quality. Its Impossible Whopper remains available in the US, though some of its other vegan options, such as the Impossible Croissan'wich, have been taken off the menu.\n\n\"Part of what McDonald's excels at is their ability to operationally make things efficient. And even if you look at the kitchen, the equipment and how it's laid out and how their workers are optimizing the space as well as the time that they are using everything is, it looks like a Toyota production system,\" Gargiulo said. \"Burger King has always been a little bit more irreverent. It's been a little bit more the smaller brother attempting to be something better than McDonald's.\"\n\nConsumers have certain expectations for McDonald's, just as they do of any brand. For McDonald's, they'd like it to be cheap, they want it to taste OK, and they want to feel like they're getting bang for their buck. But if they're worried about their waistlines, at this point it's pretty clear McDonald's is not the place to go. No one goes to J.Crew looking for a new car. No one goes to the Apple Store looking for a charm bracelet. And no one goes to McDonald's looking for greens.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_stewart@businessinsider.com",

Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water.

During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said.

Well the healthier options on the Maccies menu are not popular at all, so much so that they are being discontinued.\n\nMcDonald's USA president Joe Erlinger made it clear that salads will not be making a comeback to the menu, after their production was halted during the pandemic to speed up operations, as not enough people want them.\n\n'The demand just isn't there,' McDonald's USA president Joe Erlinger told the Wall Street Journal Global Food Forum in Chicago last week.\n\n'They're looking for great french fries, they're looking for a $5 meal deal, they're looking for a hot, fresh sandwich, and so that's what we're going to continue to provide them' he explained of McDonald's customers.\n\nBut, if you're a Brit who loves a salad, don't panic. McDonald's told Metro that they have no plans to discontinue any of the five salads currently on its menu.\n\nMcSalads were introduced in the US as part of the menu in 2000 when the McSalad Shaker debuted, with a huge advertising push.\n\nThose who ordered the Shaker would get a tall cup of salad with dressing but customers didn't latch on as it wasn't considered substantial enough.\n\nThen, in 2003, the food giant replaced the McSalad Shaker with Premium Salads which were more filling.\n\nThese portions included grilled chicken, mix-ins and dressing. Even with a heftier portion, the item went out of fashion with consumers.\n\nSo what salad options remain in the UK? The British offering includes a salad with grilled chicken breast, lettuce, cucumber, sliced tomato and red onion.\n\nMcDonald's uses its 30g of its own Balsamic Dressing, saying the meal comes with 1.4g of fat (excluding the dressing).\n\nOther items which haven't quite landed in the U.S include plant-based options.\n\nThe McPlant burger, which was introduced in 2021, was ditched in America as customers did not favour fake meat.\n\nMade with Beyond Meat, from pea and rice proteins, the McPlant has had better success in the U.K, Germany, Holland and Portugal.", "source": {"uri":

For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBusiness Do US fast-food customers want plant-based meat? Panda Express thinks so, but McDonald's has doubts DEE-ANN DURBIN Associated Press\n\nThe strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor's, while the salad has been left behind.\n\nAnother menu item that's not coming to McDonald's any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald's tested a few years ago.\n\n\"I don't think the US consumer is ... looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald's now,\" Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \"it's a trend that we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nFast food chains launch 'value menu' war after cost complaints.

But since 2020, greens have been off the menu. That's because the chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald's, they mostly want a burger and fries.\n\n\"If people really want salads from McDonald's we will gladly relaunch salads,\" said Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald's USA, in a June interview at the Wall Street Journal's annual Global Food Forum. \"But what our experience has proven is that's not what the consumer's looking for from McDonald's,\" he added.\n\n\"They're looking for great french fries, they're looking for a $5 meal deal, they're looking for a hot fresh sandwich. And so, that's what we're going to continue to provide them.\"\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District Nebo woman charged with break-in Man found dead near Lake James in McDowell County McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

For McDonald's, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends.\n\nMcDonald's had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \"the salads were the only half-healthy item I could eat at McDonald's.\") For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren't.\n\nBut in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald's salads were \"one likely source of these infections,\" the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure.\n\nAnd then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald's removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBusiness Do US fast-food customers want plant-based meat? Panda Express thinks so, but McDonald's has doubts DEE-ANN DURBIN Associated Press\n\nThe strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor's, while the salad has been left behind.\n\nAnother menu item that's not coming to McDonald's any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald's tested a few years ago.\n\n\"I don't think the US consumer is ... looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald's now,\" Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \"it's a trend that we'll continue to monitor.\"\n\nFast food chains launch 'value menu' war after cost complaints.

Will it last?", "body": "Advocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nMillions of American families are hitting the road to start summer vacation, and ordering food on the run tends to be par for the course. It couldn't come at a better time. Fast food joints are in the midst of a budget-meal war, offering promotions to lure customers back to their restaurants despite inflation woes and a minimum-wage increase in California and other states.\n\nStarting June 25, McDonald's has been offering a month-long deal featuring a combo meal -- either a McChicken, a McDouble or four-piece chicken nuggets, small fries and a small drink -- for $5.\n\nAfter McDonald's announcement, other fast food restaurants followed suit. Wendy's announced its $3 limited-time breakfast combo meal and Burger King trumpeted that it planned to bring back its $5 Your Way Meal.\n\nIn addition, fast food mobile apps continue to offer deep discounts.\n\nRecently, a Big Mac with medium fries and medium drink cost $11.79 before tax at a McDonald's in Santa Ana. That same meal ordered via a mobile app for pickup at the same location cost $6.50 before tax, a savings of $5.29.\n\nBut the prices and deals tend to vary depending on the user.\n\nDiners have taken to complaining on Reddit about the McDonald's mobile app. Some say the deals decrease with use. Others say their friends or partners were getting a better deal on the app than they were getting. A few mentioned that they could find better deals by just walking in and ordering at their local McDonald's.\n\nThe plethora of promotional deals come after diners blasted fast food companies on social media earlier this year for rising prices.\n\nIn response, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, said in an open letter in May that the average price of McDonald's menu items is up an estimated 40% since 2019.\n\n\"Recently, we have seen viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald's has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates. This is inaccurate,\" Erlinger wrote.\n\n\"The average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\" he said. \"Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That's an increase of 21% (not 100%),\" as unsubstantiated claims allege on social media.\n\nQuick-service restaurants said the increases were in response to rising inflation and labor costs -- partly due to hikes in minimum wage not just in California but throughout the country.\n\nIt's true that quick-service restaurants such as McDonalds have had to contend with increased costs, but they are by no means hurting, said Shubhranshu Singh, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in quick-service marketing.\n\n\"They are not struggling,\" Singh said. \"Inflation is going up. Wage rates are going up. But profit for McDonald's is also going up.\"\n\nGlobal comparable sales for McDonald's grew nearly 2% in the first quarter of the year, according to the latest statistics made available by the company. The fast-food giant described this profit increase as having \"benefited from average check growth driven by strategic menu price increases.\"\n\nPrice-weary diners have taken notice and become fed up with the price hikes, choosing to eat less fast food and protesting on social media that their go-to budget meals were no longer wallet-friendly, Singh said.\n\nSeveral diners took aim at McDonald's, griping on TikTok about the company charging more for food that's supposed to be affordable.\n\n\"This is $3 worth of food,\" said a customer who held up a hash brown. \"Something doesn't seem right here.\"\n\n\"McDonald's has gotten too cocky,\" said another customer. \"Y'all not supposed to be expensive.\"\n\nOne diner called it \"absurd\" that she'd paid $4.59 for a medium order of french fries.\n\nAnd then there was the uproar over a McDonald's location in Connecticut charging $18 for a Big Mac combo meal. The photo sparked a nationwide debate on soaring fast-food prices.\n\nMost McDonald's in the United States are independently franchised, so prices vary depending on where one visits.\n\nIncreased fast food prices ultimately led to slower-than-expected sales at various quick-service restaurants, such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Pizza Hut.\n\n\"Consumers are always making choices,\" said restaurant analyst Sara Senatore at Bank of America. \"When the value proposition starts to diminish, consumers will make other choices.\"\n\nUp until fairly recently, consumers were willing to pay more for quick-service food. When fast food prices started to soar in 2022, consumers just went along because prices everywhere had surged due to inflation, Senatore said.\n\nBut now inflation has lessened. Grocery prices have fallen and budget-conscious consumers may no longer see fast food as the clear-cut affordable choice, she said.\n\nBudget meals aren't new. In the 1980s, McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King engaged in a series of advertising campaigns known as the Burger Wars competing for customers in the then-flourishing fast food market.\n\n\"The hope is that the consumer will go there and maybe buy something additional to the value meal and then want to return even when there is no deal,\" Singh said.\n\nBut the promotions, analysts warned, can't last forever.\n\n\"It's not sustainable,\" Singh said. \"I don't expect any of these deals to stay.\"\n\n______\n\n\u00a92024 Los Angeles Times.

points, which can be redeemed against any menu item.\n\nWhen the game launched, there were 2.6million prizes of six chicken McNuggets up for grabs, as well as 2.1million cheeseburgers, 1.9million Big Macs and 1.9million McFlurries.\n\nApp prizes included McDonald's fries socks and bucket hats as well as a McDonald's fries pool float.\n\nThere were also more than 300,000 cash prizes released.\n\nMcDonald's regularly offers customers the chance to snap up prizes through promotions, including its Monopoly and Winning Sips games.\n\nMcDonald's Monopoly launched in 2005 and sees customers collect game pieces when they buy specific products.\n\nThese pieces can then be redeemed for prizes or rewards points.\n\nWinnings Sips is more similar to the new Surprize Fries game, with fans able to peel stickers off medium or large soft drinks which can be redeemed for prizes.\n\nLast week, McDonald's launched its latest menu shakeup including a brand new burger.\n\nThe fast food giant is adding a total of eight new items to its main offering, including returning favourites like mozzarella bites and chicken selects.\n\nThe Sun tried out all eight new items and we delivered our verdict.\n\nWhen new items are launched others are dropped and six menu items are set disappear when the new range hits restaurants.\n\nAs well as limited-time games, McDonald's customers can gain free rewards through the restaurants loyalty app MyMcDonald's Rewards.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mike Haracz, who was Manager of Culinary Innovation for the US menu for four years, has revealed some insider tips.\n\nThe 40 year old culinary expert recently revealed his favourite meal and the best customer swaps. He advised against ordering the iconic bagel breakfast sandwich as it is, suggesting a switch from the standard folded egg to either a round egg or the scrambled option.\n\nTiming, according to Mike, is crucial. \"I feel like the folded egg used on their breakfast sandwiches tends to be dry and lack flavour,\" he told NeedToKnow.\n\nHe also suggested asking for the bun to be steamed for a better burger experience. While his advice is based on \"personal taste preferences\", with over 20 years of professional experience and degrees in culinary arts and culinary nutrition, he certainly knows his stuff.\n\nHis personal favourite? The classic quarter pounder with cheese - but only if eaten within a few minutes of being served. \"If you wait too long to eat it, all of the quality improvements are lost and it tastes the way that it used to,\" he said.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, McDonald's uses patties made from 100% British and Irish beef, ensuring a delicious taste when eaten immediately - especially when paired with a side of fries.\n\nDuring his stint at McDonald's, Mike was involved in sensory and quality testing on products and ingredients. He suggests that due to the sheer volume of food McDonald's shifts every day, the fast-food giant could be somewhat restricted in what they can introduce nationally.\n\nHe said: \"There might not be enough of an ingredient in the world to support it on the menu. McDonald's corporate would provide guidelines on many aspects of the restaurants including the cooking process and hold times for food ingredients.\"\n\n\"Working in the corporate kitchens is a very different experience than working in the restaurants. We were not cooking for guests, however, the kitchens were designed to replicate the footprint of these restaurants.\"\n\n\"Just like every restaurant, the busier it was the harder it is to maintain some standards.

(That's why this is a car story, I don't want to hear any complaining.) Anyway, Ms. Dogs starts out by saying there's a rumor this McDonald's is the best, so she wanted to try it out.\n\nShe ordered a spicy chicken sandwich, french fries and... wings. Yes, the McDonald's in Guantanamo Bay sells wings. I love that so much. The wings are packaged in a 20-piece McNugget box, which is sort of strange, but no one cares.

McDonald's customers the chance to win a prize every time they bought Surprize Fries between May 29 and July 2.\n\nAround 20million prizes were up for grabs when the competition launched, but on June 24, just 2.2million had been redeemed.\n\nThis means there could be some 17.8million prizes waiting to be cashed in.\n\nCustomers had a chance to win a prize every time they bought a portion of medium or large fries, all of which had a sticker on the back.\n\nWhen peeled back, one-in-three stickers revealed an instant prize which can be redeemed in restaurants until the end of today.\n\nAnyone who entered 10 sticker codes in the app could unlock a \"Bonus Fry\" of 2,500 MyMcDonald's Rewards points, which can be redeemed against any menu item.\n\nWhen the game launched, there were 2.6million prizes of six chicken McNuggets up for grabs, as well as 2.1million cheeseburgers, 1.9million Big Macs and 1.9million McFlurries.\n\nApp prizes included McDonald's fries socks and bucket hats as well as a McDonald's fries pool float.\n\nThere were also more than 300,000 cash prizes released.\n\nMcDonald's regularly offers customers the chance to snap up prizes through promotions, including its Monopoly and Winning Sips games.\n\nMcDonald's Monopoly launched in 2005 and sees customers collect game pieces when they buy specific products.\n\nThese pieces can then be redeemed for prizes or rewards points.\n\nWinnings Sips is more similar to the new Surprize Fries game, with fans able to peel stickers off medium or large soft drinks which can be redeemed for prizes.\n\nLast week, McDonald's launched its latest menu shakeup including a brand new burger.\n\nThe fast food giant is adding a total of eight new items to its main offering, including returning favourites like mozzarella bites and chicken selects.\n\nWhen new items are launched others are dropped and six menu items are set disappear when the new range hits restaurants.\n\nAs well as limited-time games,

We'd say that if you are having a cheeseburger and fries, the addition of fried McNuggets are, well, a tad extra, as the kids say. Which is not to say we have not partaken of the opportunity. We certainly have, nuggets and all.\n\nBut we will say this: It is a very good deal for cash-strapped families in a world where fast-food prices have shot up over the last couple of years, not just because the cost of ingredients and labor were rising precipitously, but because restaurants and other businesses could do so as prices for other goods were going up and they felt like they had cover. Families found themselves shelling out well upward of $50 to feed four at fast-food joints that used to be cheap.\n\nBut, hosanna, the market reasserted itself without any government mandates or interventions. Customers stopped buying expensive menu items, and McDonald's reacted. They're not the only chains to do so. There are comparable deals at competing restaurant chains like Taco Bell, Burger King and even Starbucks, which now is offering a tall iced or hot coffee paired with a fair-to-middling butter croissant for that same 5 greenbacks. Enough to pay, we'd argue, but Starbucks customers have been paying a whole lot more of late for their caffeine and pastries.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of today's wild, income-discriminating pricing mechanisms is that shopping around doesn't so much mean going across the street as picking a different section of the same drive-through menu: rich folks this side, please, where there is lots of profit, and the shamelessly cost-conscious please look over here without the pretty pictures. There to the side, perhaps a little less of pretty much the same food comes at a far, far better price.\n\nMorningstar mused recently that the profit margin for most McDonald's franchisees on that $5 deal probably was only about a quarter, although if you sell enough of them, a 5% margin is not nothing. And it shows you how much money is being made on those combos that reach $15 or even more: Sandwiches have high food costs, but fries and drinks don't cost but a tiny fraction of the purchase price.\n\nWe already knew where to look on the menu: McDonald's already had a buy-one-get-one-for-$1 deal going in Chicagoland. But the new $5 deal, which is spreading all over the land of freeway exits and state route whatevers, is yet better.\n\nIt's a really nice break for families: occasionally.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cheeseburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French fries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McChicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McChicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_McNuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken McNuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_nugget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken nugget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caffeine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croissant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taco Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drive-through"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1719329587", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714399", "eventUri": "eng-9714399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Coming out in November, the book boasts 200 photos taken from the more than 1,000 burger joints he saw.\n\n\"McDonald's is the largest and most important influential restaurant in the world,\" He told The Post. \"You always want to cover the biggest story as a journalist. There really is no bigger story than McDonald's.\"\n\nHe also explores regional meals -- the author swears Mickey D's tastes better overseas -- like burgers served on a McBaugette in Paris, a New Zealand favorite \"kiwi burger\" served with eggs and beets, and marinated chicken bones in China.\n\nAs for style, a few one-of-a-kind dining rooms on the menu include a log cabin designed by Mickey D's in Wisconsin and a \"Big Mac Museum\" at the sandwich's 1967 birthplace in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.\n\nAlso, there is an Italian location where an ancient Roman road was excavated below its arches.\n\nIn addition to those, here are some spots The Post thinks you can sink your teeth into.\n\nThere's nothing plain about this Kiwi location.\n\nBurger-loving Taupo, New Zealand, is home to a refitted propeller plane that serves some of the best airline food while stationary.\n\nAt first, the only McDonald's of its kind can seem like some sort of prop, according to He. But perception changes the closer you get to the Douglas DC-3 model from the World War II era.\n\n\"As you're walking up to it, you go, 'Oh, wait, oh wait, it is a real plane,'\" He said, adding that McDonald's \"always tastes better\" on board any sort of flying machine.\n\nHere's one that will have you earn your calories.\n\nA McDonald's in Lindvallen, Sweden, is accessible only to skiers coming on and off the Scandinavian mountaintop.\n\n\"You don't even need to take off your skis -- there is a 'ski-up window,' which I thought was pretty cool,\" He said.\n\nIt's out of this world: Roswell, New Mexico, a little town that gained notoriety in 1947 for an alleged spaceship crash, adapted its local McDonald's exterior to evoke that of a spaceship in shape and decoration.\n\nThe inside also features a special gift shop solely for the UFO theme, plus a stellar McPlay Place where Ronald McDonald and pals are all sporting spacesuits.\n\nOn top of all that, \"there are just alien statues, everywhere,\" He said.\n\nHead to a very special canal in Hamburg, Germany's \"City of Bridges\" for a chance to enjoy a Big Mac or, maybe more fittingly, a Filet-O-Fish while seabound.\n\nThis McDonald's has a lengthy pier that allows boaters to pull up for some takeout as employees walk an order down to each vessel, according to He.\n\n\"The boating culture there in its canals is it goes back centuries,\" He said. \"I believe it's the only boat-up McDonald's in the world.\"\n\nWhen China's first McDonald's opened in Shenzhen, China, in 1990, it wasn't equipped with the stereotypical red roof on top. Instead, the experimental concept -- there are now close to 5,000 -- was erected with a traditional pagoda-style roof.\n\nAlso keeping to local customs, the location has special items like bamboo shoot chicken wraps, porridge, youtiao fried dough, matcha and green-tea McFlurries, He said.\n\nA former two-level hotel and later bar designed in fabulous art deco style outside of Melbourne, Australia, is now arguably the nation's most hip fast-food joint.\n\n\"Because it's on the Melbourne tourism website, you can safely assume that it is one of the favorite buildings in the city,\" He said. \"I think most people go there just to snap a photo of it.\"\n\nThe appetizing architecture also happens to be located adjacent to a 24/7 brothel -- where clients certainly work up their appetites.\n\nThis location doesn't require any elaborate travel for New Yorkers.\n\nOn Long Island in New Hyde Park, a converted mansion with local historical significance dating back to the 1700s had its distinct exterior and some of its insides kept intact when McDonald's came marching in during the mid-1980s.\n\nNow, the two-floor extravaganza off Jericho Turnpike is busy as ever with an eloquent dining room, grand staircase and a packed drive-thru that loops around the property.\n\nHe said that this was one of the first examples of the fast-food titan defying its usual building standards at the request of locals.\n\nSince then, more locations on LI -- particularly out east on the North Fork -- have followed suit with designs that look closer to quant houses than burger joints.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Reflections After a Trip to So. America", "body": "by Santiago Ramos at Wisdom of Crowds: Something happens to a country when it gets its first McDonald's. There was once something called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention. The journalist Thomas Friedman defined it in 1996: \"No two countries that both have a McDonald's have ever fought a war against each other.\" The theory has been disproven many times over. No one takes it seriously anymore; it failed to predict anything. But a kernel of truth remains. The first McDonald's is the sign of a new era.\n\nI was a kid in 1996, when the first McDonald's opened in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay. It was an anticipated event covered by the newspapers, fodder for family conversations. The prices were accessible only for the upper middle class. But everyone wanted a taste of America. A friend of mine, one of seven children, told me about his mother's plan to take one child to McDonald's every month, starting with the oldest. This was the only way his family could afford to give everyone a chance to experience McDonald's.\n\nA year after that, I moved to the United States with my parents. I have lived here ever since, returning to my birthplace every few years. The biggest changes I noticed on my last trip to Paraguay, in 2019, when the proliferation of big screen advertisements and billboards throughout the city, along with mostly-empty high rises where foreign millionaires parked their money, looked to me like a subtropical Times Square that stretched for miles longer than the real one. Visiting Asuncion this June, I noticed fewer new things. Instead, there were more of the things that I saw in 2019. More high rises, more people living in apartments, more advertisements. And McDonald's franchises everywhere, within and beyond the capital city.\n\nWhat these new structures replaced were stately colonial homes, decaying office buildings, or empty lots. The center of Asuncion, with its crumbling nineteenth century Beaux Arts houses, run down would-be European plazas, and historic colonial-era churches, remains as a reminder not so much of any other era as the time right before McDonald's came to town.\n\nThe changes I noticed in 2019 have continued their development, ushering in a new way of life (or system, or spirit) that is slowly maturing and congealing. Today, the upper classes are no longer interested in McDonald's. \"Now everyone is into being fit,\" my cousin told me last month, when I was in Paraguay visiting family. She used the English word, \"fit\", pronouncing it like feet. You can hear a lot of English in the posh districts of Asuncion: too much, home office, bro, love. Entrepreneurs trained in American universities have succeeded in reproducing many of the attractions of American city life. In the nicer neighborhoods, you can find microbreweries and craft burger joints. Young adults work in coffee shops where the tables are strategically placed near electrical outlets. A Third World nation's \"development\" can mean many things, and one of them is the replication of North American creature comforts.\n\nOfficial statistics report that a quarter of all Paraguayans live below the poverty line, and that the Gini coefficient is still high...", "source": {"uri": "despardes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DesPardes + PKonweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci\u00f3n", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asunci\u00f3n"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Asunci\u00f3n"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ramos_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Ramos (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lexus_and_the_Olive_Tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lexus and the Olive Tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-rise building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fodder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaux-Arts_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beaux-Arts architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European colonization of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gini coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/despardes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/art-perspective-sip.jpg?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714399", "eventUri": "eng-9714399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

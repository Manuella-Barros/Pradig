There are many theories, with some claiming that it comes from how people used to mine gold, while others believe it is a gimmick that athletes are asked to do.\n\nSome claim that because gold is softer than silver or bronze, one way to figure out whether your medal is authentic or not is to bite into it. Should your teeth leave a mark or dent on the precious accolade, you'd know you have a gold medal. During the California gold rush in the 1800s, prospectors would test whether they had real gold by biting into it.\n\nAccording to Oxford Economics, an Olympic gold medal will cost around \u00a3798 - and are not made completely of gold. They contain approximately six grams of gold, with the rest of the medal composed of silver and weigh around 1.17lbs.\n\nSilver medals weigh slightly less at 1.17lbs, while bronze medals weigh 1lbs.\n\nBut others believe the phenomenon is driven by photographers, with David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, telling CNN back in 2012 that athletes bite their medals because they are asked to by cameramen. 'It's become an obsession with the photographers,\" Wallechinsky said.\n\n'I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell.\n\n'I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own.'\n\nOthers, including Temple University, Philadelphia professor Frank Farley, believe that biting a medal is a social phenomenon that allows athletes to feel part of the 'winning zeitgeist'.\n\n'Sports all have their eccentricities,' he said, per Lad Bible. 'If you want to be part of the winning zeitgeist, that winning culture, you participate in that winning practice.\n\n'It makes your medal yours.

From the ceremonial lighting of the Olympic flame to the grandeur of the opening ceremonies, each tradition tells its own unique story. Yet, amidst these historic customs, one curious practice stands out as a quirky relic from the past: athletes biting their medals.\n\nIt's a sight as iconic as the Games themselves: athletes, beaming with pride on the podium, their medals catching the light. But as they pose for photographers, many can't resist the impulse to bite their hard-earned honours. Why do they do it?\n\nThe tradition of has its roots in history, tracing back to an era when gold was used as currency. Merchants would chomp down on gold coins to test their authenticity, as pure gold is soft and would leave a mark if bitten.\n\nFast forward to today, and Olympic medals are a far cry from solid gold. They consist of only about 6 grams of gold, with the remainder being silver and other metals. So, the athletes aren't actually verifying the gold content when they give their medals a nibble. And yet, this quirky tradition has become so entrenched in Olympic culture that it's almost expected.\n\nWhat began as a method to test the authenticity of medals has morphed into a celebratory gesture. Today, athletes bite their medals not to check for gold, but as part of the euphoria of their victory and, at times, to comply with photographers' demands.\n\nPhotographers often insist on this medal-biting pose, sometimes coaxing or even pressuring athletes to comply. David Wallechinsky, President of the International Society of Olympic Historians, has pointed out that the medal-biting pose is a coveted \"money shot\" for photographers.\n\n\"It's become an obsession with the photographers. I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell. I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own,\" Wallechinsky told CNN back in 2012.\n\nSome athletes have even suffered unpleasant consequences from this pose, like German luger David Moeller, who broke his tooth while biting his silver medal in 2010.\n\nDespite the risks, the medal-biting tradition shows no signs of slowing down. It's become an iconic part of the Olympic experience, capturing the thrill of victory in a single, unforgettable image. And as long as photographers keep asking for the shot, athletes will likely keep biting -- even if they're not actually checking for real gold.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_flame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic flame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallechinsky", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Wallechinsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_of_Olympic_Historians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Society of Olympic Historians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-112097028,width-700,resizemode-4,imgsize-7770/manu-bhaker-medal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775480", "eventUri": "eng-9775480", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Gold medals, historically, have been made primarily out of silver, with minimal gold content, dating back to the 1912 Olympics. The tradition of biting medals likely originated from testing gold authenticity in the late 1800s and has endured as a symbol of achievement.\n\nSeeing images of athletes biting their well-earned gold medals is a very common sight for not only the Olympics, but almost any competition, though, fans may have some confusion as to why this is a trend.\n\nBack in 2012, the year when the Olympics were held in London, CNN's interview with the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH), David Wallechinsky, gave insight into why this curious event exists.\n\nThe American historian said: \"It's become an obsession with the photographers. I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell. I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own.\"\n\nThere's no question that the frozen image of an athlete celebrating one of their life's greatest achievements with a chomp of gold is a memorable sight, and there's nothing that a photographer would love more than to record such a sight for the ages. It's very understandable as a reason to just pose for the cameras, but is there any other possible reason for biting metal medals?\n\nHistorical Reasons for Biting Medals\n\nWhile the idea that the medals are actually chocolate is entertaining, the reality is not only not delicious, but also not in-line with the golden appearance. Back in the previous Olympics of Tokyo 2020, the official Twitter account covering the whole competition did explain in a post that the medals were made out of recycled electronic materials donated by the Japanese public. The gold medals of London 2012, meanwhile, were composed of only 1.34% gold, as it was primarily made of silver (93%!) and topped up with copper.\n\nRelated UFC's Islam Makhachev Slams 'Disgusting' Olympics Opening Ceremony\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympics opening ceremony has received heavy criticism over the last few days, and UFC's Islam Makhachev has piled on.\n\nThere is no clear indication of when exactly the tradition started, but history suggests that biting gold was a way of testing the authenticity of the material back in the late 1800s. If it was possible to make a dent, then the material was likely gold as was believed during that time.\n\nAs it turns out, the latter case has been around for a while according to the late former ISOH secretary general Tony Bijerk. He had told NBC in an email that the gold medal was actual gold in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, with all ensuing Olympics having them be primarily made of silver with a gold tint.\n\nSo the notion of testing for genuine gold doesn't apply to sporting competitions, but one can argue that it's a simple case of following traditions at this point. Young athletes will grow up watching their heroes fight and win for glory, celebrating achievements with a bite of their hard-earned silverware.\n\nInspired by watching their idols and/or predecessors, it makes the feeling all the more special to do the same act when their time arrives to bow your head and have the medal wrapped around your neck. A cycle of sporting tradition that passes on from one generation to the next set of Olympians or superstars of a discipline. This may not just apply to the biting celebration, such as Cristiano Ronaldo's famous goal celebration that has been copied by many aspiring football stars that idolised him growing up.\n\nBut when it comes to the Olympics, there's no more iconic image than a new champion posing with that special medal in between their teeth.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

There are many theories, with some claiming that it comes from how people used to mine gold, while others believe it is a gimmick that athletes are asked to do.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: Full medal table and results\n\nSome claim that because gold is softer than silver or bronze, one way to figure out whether your medal is authentic or not is to bite into it. Should your teeth leave a mark or dent on the precious accolade, you'd know you have a gold medal. During the California gold rush in the 1800s, prospectors would test whether they had real gold by biting into it.\n\nAccording to Oxford Economics, an Olympic gold medal will cost around \u00a3798 - and are not made completely of gold. They contain approximately six grams of gold, with the rest of the medal composed of silver and weigh around 1.17lbs.\n\nSilver medals weigh slightly less at 1.17lbs, while bronze medals weigh 1lbs.\n\nBut others believe the phenomenon is driven by photographers, with David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, telling CNN back in 2012 that athletes bite their medals because they are asked to by cameramen.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIt's not just Olympians, though, who bite their medals, with Jude Bellingham (pictured) having been pictured biting his Champions League winners medal earlier this summer\n\nSimone Biles (pictured) is seen biting her gold medal after the women's all-round final of the artistic gymnastics at Rio 2016\n\nSome believe the trend is an obsession among photographers who ask the athletes to bit their medals for pictures (Michael Phelps, pictured)\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'It's become an obsession with the photographers,\" Wallechinsky said.\n\n'I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell.\n\n'I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own.'\n\nOthers, including Temple University, Philadelphia professor Frank Farley, believe that biting a medal is a social phenomenon that allows athletes to feel part of the 'winning zeitgeist'.\n\n'Sports all have their eccentricities,' he said, per Lad Bible. 'If you want to be part of the winning zeitgeist, that winning culture, you participate in that winning practice.\n\n'It makes your medal yours. It's an emotional connection with your accomplishment.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Basically, if you took a bite into it and you could see your teeth mark, there's a good chance it was authentic and actually gold.\n\nThat's largely irrelevant these days, especially in the context of the Olympics, but the tradition has endured. Of course, the gold medals awarded at the Olympics aren't actually solid gold - it's more of a compound of around 90 per cent silver, and at least six grams of the valuable stuff.

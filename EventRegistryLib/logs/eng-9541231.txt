Much of the response sees Drake deny grooming underage girls for sex, an allegation that has followed the rapper for years now.\n\nDrake called Lamar's claims that he is a pedophile \"the s -- t I expected.\"\n\n\"I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with,\" Drake raps. \"Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected / If I was f -- ing young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested / I'm way too famous for this s -- t you just suggested.\"\n\nIn the song, Drake addresses his controversial friendship with Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown, who was 14 years old when she met the rapper. In 2018, Brown (now 20) said she and Drake texted often and that he regularly offered her career and life advice.\n\n\"Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager,\" Drake defends himself in the new diss track.\n\n(Rap beef aside, Drake has never been formally accused of pedophilia.)\n\nHe also fired back at Lamar's allegations that he's been hiding an 11-year-old daughter.\n\nThe claim, made in Lamar's song Meet the Grahams, came as a surprise to Drake's core fanbase, who speculated whether the rapper may have another child away from the public eye, similar to his son Adonis. After a 2018 rap beef with rapper Pusha T, Drake confirmed he had a son who was born the year prior.\n\nAs for Lamar's insistence that Drake has another child, the rapper said in The Heart Part 6 that he and his team \"fed\" Lamar bad information.\n\n\"We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information / A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it,\" Drake raps. \"We thought about giving a fake name or a destination / But you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation.\"\n\nSo far, there's been nine tracks released in the ongoing feud between Drake and Lamar -- though Drake seemed to imply he's growing tired of their back and forth, regardless of how enthusiastic their collective fanbases have been.\n\n\"I don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessing,\" Drake raps on The Heart Part 6, later adding, \"I'm not gonna lie, this s -- t was some good exercise. It's good to get out, get the pen working.\"\n\nRegardless, the beef has won both rappers placement in this week's Hot 100 music charts. Want to know the whole story? Read on for a thorough explanation of what's going on.\n\nIt's been no-holds-barred (or rather, no holds bars) between Drake and Lamar since late March, but the rappers have been arguing since even before then, beginning in 2013 when Lamar rapped on Big Sean's Control about a desire to \"murder\" Drake and other famous rappers.\n\nAcross their numerous diss tracks in recent months, the rappers have repeatedly doubled down on their allegations against one another, with arguments spanning from comparisons of artistry to illegal behaviour.\n\nFans of both Drake and Lamar have been taking sides and eagerly dissecting and meme-ifying every verse, beat and clever (or not-so-clever) quip.\n\nThe rap beef's first instalment came on March 22, when Lamar -- alongside rapper Future and producer Metro Boomin -- released Like That.\n\nOver a flashy, synthesizer drumbeat, Lamar disavowed rap's \"Big Three,\" a common consensus that he, Drake and J. Cole are the best rappers in the music game.\n\nLamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner, slammed the Big Three, declaring instead \"it's only me.\"\n\n\"Fore all your dogs gettin' buried / That's a K with all these nines, he gon' see Pet Sematary,\" Lamar raps, referencing Drake's 2023 album For All the Dogs.\n\nLamar compared himself to Prince and Drake to Michael Jackson, boasting, \"Prince outlived Mike Jack.\"\n\nThree weeks after the release of Like That, Drake hit back at Lamar with the release of Push Ups on April 13.\n\nThe song initially came as a leak but was later released to streaming platforms.\n\nIn Push Ups, Drake, who is the most streamed rapper in the world, pokes fun at Lamar's commercial success working with popular artists like Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" Drake chides. \"You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down / Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down.\"\n\nDrake also took aim at rapper Rick Ross, who responded with a diss of his own.\n\nDays after Push Ups, Drake released Taylor Made Freestyle on April 19.\n\nThe song has since been taken down, as it featured A.I.-generated voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Shakur's estate threatened to sue Drake over the song.\n\nDrake rapped alongside the A.I. voices and accused Lamar of waiting to respond to Push Ups over fears of competing with Taylor Swift's album release for The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\"Now we gotta wait a f -- ing week cause Taylor Swift is your new top, and if you boutta drop, she gotta approve,\" Drake raps. \"This girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud / She tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg, 52, didn't publicly threaten legal action, and seemed mostly unbothered.\n\nFans didn't have to wait long for Lamar's second diss, which arrived on April 30.\n\nNamed Euphoria after the HBO show Drake produces, Lamar's verses slammed Drake's use of A.I. and his rap artistry in general, calling him a \"scam artist.\"\n\nBut Lamar's jabs weren't only about Drake's career. The rapper took aim at Drake's parenting, personal life, allegations of plastic surgery and Drake's racial identity.\n\n\"How many more fairytale stories about your life 'til we've had enough? How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?\" Lamar prods.\n\nJust as Drake did, Lamar again dissed his opponent before they could respond.\n\n6:16 in LA was released on Friday, with \"6:16\" seemingly a reference to June 16, Father's Day.\n\nIn the song, Lamar slams Drake's record label, OVO, and called the rapper a \"bully.\"\n\n\"Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?\" Lamar warns. \"Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person / Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"\n\nThe song was produced by Jack Antonoff, the acclaimed music producer and longtime collaborator of Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Ain't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant / F -- in' with good people make good people go to bat,\" Lamar rapped in reference to Antonoff.\n\nIn the song, Drake suggests that Lamar's children, shared with fianc\u00e9 Whitney Alford, are actually fathered by Lamar's longtime creative partner Dave Free.\n\nDrake also accused Lamar of domestic abuse against Alford.\n\n\"When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defence 'cause she's bigger than you?\" he raps.\n\nHe later adds, \"There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean / They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen.\"\n\n(Lamar has never been formally accused of domestic violence. Alford has not commented on the rap beef publicly.)\n\nDrake also accused Lamar of pushing Shakur's estate to sue him over Taylor Made Freestyle.\n\nIn his retaliation, released 20 minutes after Family Matters, Lamar accused Drake of being addicted to gambling, sex, drugs and alcohol.\n\nLamar said Drake was wrong to bring his family into their feud. In the song, he takes aim at Drake's own family and raps that he was sorry for Drake's son, Adonis.\n\nMeet the Grahams is also where Lamar accuses Drake of having a secret daughter.\n\n\"He a narcissist, misogynist, living inside his songs / Try destroy families rather than takin' care of his own / Should be teaching you timetables or watching Frozen with you / Or at your 11th birthday singing poems with you,\" Lamar raps. \"It's not your fault that he's hiding another child.\"\n\n\"A child should never be compromised and he keeping his child around them / And we gotta raise our daughters knowing there's predators like him lurking,\" Lamar continues. \"I'm looking to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Drake denied having a daughter and wrote, \"Nahhhh hold on can someone find my hidden daughter pls and send her to me...these guys are in shambles.\"\n\nHours after the release of Meet the Grahams, Lamar also dropped Not Like Us on Saturday.\n\nThe track sees Lamar double down on many of his accusations toward Drake.\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\" Lamar raps, adding, \"Certified Lover Boy, certified pedophiles...Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"\n\nLamar called Drake a \"colonizer\" and attributed his success to the many other rappers Drake has worked with.\n\nEven the title of Drake's latest diss, The Heart Part 6, takes aim at Lamar, who has an ongoing five-part series of songs under the same title. Lamar released The Heart, Part 1 in 2010 ahead of his mixtape Overly Dedicated.\n\nAs well as denying the existence of a daughter, Drake controversially references Lamar being molested as a child.\n\n\"My mom came over today and I was like, 'Mother I, mother I, mother I ... / Wait a second, that's that one record where you say you got molested,\" Drake raps. \"I just made the whole connection / This about to get so depressing / This is trauma from your own confessions.\"\n\nThe line is in reference to Lamar's song Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, in which Lamar says his mother was sexually abused. The song, however, maintains that Lamar wasn't molested as a child, and he has never publicly said otherwise.\n\nOn April 13's Push Ups, Drake raps, \"Metro, shut your ho a -- up and make some drums.\"\n\nIn what's since become a fan favourite release, Metro on Sunday dropped a beat entitled BBL Drizzy. With a cheery 150 beats per minute (BPM) on the track, a singer passionately belts, \"I'm thicker than a Snicker ... These yams deserve a trophy.\"\n\nThe beat is a diss on its own, poking fun at a popular rumour that Drake (nickname Drizzy) had a Brazilian butt lift (BBL).\n\nMetro encouraged his followers to rap over the beat he created, even advertising that the creator of the \"best verse\" would receive a complementary beat from Metro for their personal use. Since the drop, rap fans have used the track to diss Drake themselves in several languages.\n\nFans of both rappers are either eagerly awaiting yet another diss track or are hopeful that the longstanding feud will come to an inevitable, messy end.\n\nJ. Cole, a member of the so-called \"Big Three,\" seems to be hoping for the latter. Though Cole originally struck back at Lamar after the release of Like That, the rapper has since backed down and apologized.\n\nDuring April's Dreamville Fest in Raleigh, N.C., Cole admitted he isn't \"proud\" of his own diss track, 7 Minute Drill. Cole said releasing the song was a \"lame\" and \"goofy\" thing to do.\n\nBut for Drake and Lamar, as well as their dedicated followers, the beef continues. As fans wait for more music from the rappers, should it come, the respective camps backing Drake and Lamar have taken to trolling one another.\n\nLamar's admirers are even tagging Drake's Toronto Bridle Path home on Google Maps with remarks about pedophilia and ghost writing.\n\nDespite the severity of some of the allegations made by Drake and Lamar, rap fans have poked fun at the feud online with an ever-growing flow of jokes and memes -- and it doesn't seem like it will end any time soon.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_Bobby_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millie Bobby Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_5", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maroon 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusha_T", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pusha T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SZA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

And I'm like, can't I be Team Rap in general?\"\n\nDay then tapped in Lipa, the team's \"local culture critic,\" to do a \"deep dive\" into the rappers ongoing feud and decode their diss track lyrics.\n\nAfter pointing out that Lipa taught piano at a local grade school, he then asked what rap songs she typically taught students, to which she simply replied, \"Mostly Elton John.\"\n\nWhen asked by Day what she'd learned about the beef thus far, Lipa shared insight into a \"clue\" shared in Lamar's song \"Euphoria.\"\n\n\"When Kendrick describes Drake as Canadian, that's because Drake is from Toronto,\" Lipa said. \"And he calls Drake 'Crodie,' which is a term used by the Crips, which according to Wikipedia is an alliance of street gangs based in Southern California.\"\n\nLipa also took a moment to decode Drake's disses in his song \"Push Ups,\" adding, \"Now in Drake's diss track, he questions Kendrick's manhood, saying he wears a size seven shoe.\"\n\nThe feud between Drake and Lamar dates back over a decade.\n\nIn the early 2010s, Drake and Lamar appeared to have a good relationship. Lamar appeared on Drake's album \"Take Care\" in 2011 and was invited to be the opening act on the Canadian rapper's Club Paradise Tour in 2012. They also collaborated on Lamar's 2012 track \"Poetic Justice.\"\n\nBy August 2013, things seemed to turn sour when Lamar lambasted several rappers, including Drake, on Big Sean's song \"Control,\" though the former \"Degrassi\" star brushed off the verse in an interview the same month.\n\nWhile things seemed to settle down between the rappers the following month, come October 2013, Lamar dissed Drake again in a BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher. This kicked off a yearslong feud between the musicians from 2014 to 2020 as they released more diss tracks referencing one another.\n\nSeveral years passed, but by March 2024, the feud appeared to be reignited when Lamar dissed both Drake and J.Cole on his track \"Like That.\" The rappers began exchanging diss tracks again between April and May 2024, with both taking shots at their personal lives, including their families.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Day", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikey Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dua Lipa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Gardner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heidi Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elton John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Paradise_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Club Paradise Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Justice_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poetic Justice (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET_Hip_Hop_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET Hip Hop Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The 37-year-old Canadian rapper, who has a 6-year-old son, also suggested that he leaked false information about having a daughter to Lamar, singing: \"We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information/ A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it.\"\n\nThe fight between the two men reached its climax (at least, to date) over the weekend, resulting in the release of multiple songs by and featuring the two artists. While their tense relationship dates back years, the origins of this most recent dispute can be traced to Drake's song \"First Person Shooter,\" which was released as part of his album, For All the Dogs, last October. During that track, featured guest J. Cole called himself, Drake, and Lamar the \"big three.\" When Lamar was featured on Future's \"Like That\" on March 22, he ripped into Cole and Drake for suggesting they are on the same level.\n\nRead More: Why Drake Had to Take Down His Song That Featured AI-Tupac Vocals\n\nThe ensuing drama has brought forward serious, unverified claims, and shows no signs of slowing down. It is the latest chapter in a long tradition of rap feuds that has seen rivalries between the likes of Jay-Z and Nas and Tupac and Biggie.\n\nHere's a recent timeline of the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nBoth rappers achieved mainstream fame at around the same time in the early 2010s. They've worked together in the past; on Drake's 2011 album, Take Care, Lamar is featured on an interlude, and Lamar had Drake on his second studio album, 2012's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, on the song \"Poetic Justice.\"\n\nThe first sign of trouble seems to have cropped up around 2013, when Lamar appeared on Big Sean's \"Control.\" Lamar called out Drake and several other rappers on the song, but Drake didn't engage at first, suggesting in interviews at the time that he was not going to take the bait.\n\nInstead, Drake's beef with Meek Mill in 2015 consumed much of his time, and later, in 2018, he got into it with Pusha T, who revealed that Drake was hiding a secret baby in the song \"The Story of Adidon\" -- which Drake later admitted was true.\n\nIt wasn't until \"First Person Shooter\" came out last year that Drake reopened the conflict with Lamar, intentionally or not, after Cole referred to himself, Drake, and Lamar as the \"Big Three.\"\n\nLamar, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for his album DAMN., took offense to the idea that he and Drake are on the same skill level. The standout line in Future's song \"Like That,\" which is produced by Metro Boomin, is, \"Motherf-ck the big three, it's just big me.\"\n\nHe also refers to Drake's most recent album, For All The Dogs, rapping, \"'Fore all your dogs gettin' buried/ That's a K with all these nines, he gon' see Pet Sematary.\"\n\nShortly after \"Like That\" came out, Cole released a surprise album called Might Delete Later, and one of the songs, \"7 Minute Drill,\" includes a diss directed at Lamar.\n\nIn it, he raps, \"Your first sh-t was classic, your last sh-t was tragic/ Your second sh-t put n----s to sleep, but they gassed it/ Your third sh-t was massive, and that was your prime,\" a line that many listeners took issue with because Cole suggests that To Pimp a Butterfly (an album widely regarded as Lamar's best) was boring. He says in the song that people don't care about Lamar, rapping, \"He averagin' one hard verse like every thirty months or somethin'/ If he wasn't dissin', then we wouldn't be discussin' him.\"\n\nHowever, Cole then decided to distance himself from the beef. He later said that the song \"didn't sit right with his spirit\" and removed it from streaming services on April 12, saying his actions are some of the \"lamest, goofiest sh-t\" he's participated in.\n\nRap fans waited with bated breath for Drake's response, and he returned to the beef with not one song, but two, \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" released on April 19. The Toronto rapper attempts to put Lamar in his place, calling him a \"pipsqueak\" and rapping, \"How the f-ck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?\" Drake also attempts to make fun of Lamar for doing features on pop songs. \"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/ Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he raps on \"Push Ups,\" referring to the 2015 remix of Swift's \"Bad Blood\" and \"Don't Wanna Know\" with Maroon 5 the following year.\n\nBut Lamar isn't the only person called out on this record. Drake also dissed Future, The Weeknd, Rick Ross, NBA player Ja Morant, Metro Boomin, and Cole on the song.\n\nFollowing \"Push Ups,\" Drake briefly released \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" sharing the song in a now-deleted Instagram post on April 19 with the caption: \"While we wait on you, I guess.\" In the song, Drake alleged Lamar did not release a response to his diss track because Taylor Swift had just put out her latest album The Tortured Poets Department. \"Now we gotta wait a f-cking week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new top, and if you boutta drop, she gotta approve,\" rapped Drake.\n\nRead More: How AI is Wreaking Havoc on the Fanbases of Taylor Swift, Drake, and Other Pop Stars\n\nBut the track was short-lived after Drake was served a cease-and-desist letter from Tupac Shakur's estate for using AI-generated vocals from the rap legend, who died in 1996. Drake was then forced to remove \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" from all public platforms. The estate said they would have never approved of using Shakur's voice for the track.\n\nThe song also featured AI vocals from Snoop Dogg, who joked about it on Instagram.\n\nLamar returned on April 30 with the hostile response \"Euphoria,\" full of double entendres and deep cuts. The title seems to reference the HBO show of the same name, on which Drake is an executive producer. The song starts with a sample of Richard Pryor from The Wiz saying, \"Everything they say about me is true, I'm a phony.\"\n\nLamar then starts shooting off diss after diss after diss. \"Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale/ A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now/ You'r\u0435 not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being acc\u0435pted,\" he raps. \"Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection,\" taking aim at Drake's biracial identity.\n\nHe goes on to call himself \"the biggest hater\" before unleashing a tirade on the song, \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk/ I hate the way that you dress/ I hate the way that you sneak dissing/ If I flight it's gonna be direct/ We hate the b-tches you f-ck because they confuse themselves with real women.\" He ends the song by saying he doesn't like how Drake says the N-word and suggests he no longer say it.\n\nLamar dropped a second song in the same week he released \"Euphoria,\" with multiple possible meanings behind the cryptic title. He released \"6:16 in LA\" as an Instagram Reel on his page on Friday. The cover art for the song features a single black glove, seemingly a nod to the O.J. Simpson trial -- which began on June 16, 1995. Tupac's birthday is also on June 16, as is Father's Day this year. It's also the day the television show Euphoria dropped its first episode. There is also a Bible verse, Corinthians 6:16, that could be read as a dig at Drake's alleged taste in women: \"Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, 'The two will become one flesh.'\"\n\nOne of the most surprising aspects about the song was the inclusion of Jack Antonoff's name on the producer credits. The Bleachers frontman is known for working closely with Taylor Swift and hasn't previously been publicly involved in this rap feud. Lamar digs further into Drake to suggest that the Toronto rapper might have moles on his team, feeding him information.\n\nDrake responded to Lamar by questioning the true father of Lamar's child with fianc\u00e9 Whitney Alford, and possibly alleging that Lamar is unfaithful and physically abusive in his current relationship in \"Family Matters.\" \"You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen. And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem,\" Drake raps on the track released on May 3. (Lamar has not directly addressed these claims, although he did say in his response track \"Meet the Grahams,\" \"This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game/ But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name/ Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?\")\n\nLater in that verse, Drake specifically names Dave Free, a record executive who works as Lamar's manager, saying, \"I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free.\" Drake also called Lamar and his body of work, which often addresses racism, inauthentic, saying, \"Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed/ You justin actin' like an activist, it's make-believe.\"\n\nThe music video shows the destruction of a van used in the 2012 album cover of Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. As of Monday morning, the track is #1 on \"trending for music\" on YouTube.\n\nLess than an hour after Drake released \"Family Matters,\" Lamar put out \"Meet the Grahams.\" The track is arguably the most aggressive of songs released in the past few months, and starts with Lamar apologizing to Drake's son for having him as a father. Lamar then goes on to claim without evidence that Drake takes Ozempic, and used photos of medication with Drake's legal name, Audrey Drake Graham, on it, as the cover art for the song. (The images have not been verified as legitimate.) He alludes to gossip that Drake has had a Brazilian butt lift (a rumor -- which Drake has not directly responded to -- that prompted Rick Ross to coin the nickname \"BBL Drizzy\"), and even mentions the way that Drake hid his son from the public eye. \"Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms. Don't have a kid to hide, a kid to hide again,\" Lamar raps.\n\nIn the second verse, Lamar makes severe implications about Drake by comparing him to Hollywood sex offender Harvey Weinstein, saying, \"Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest they life.\" (Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction was recently overturned in New York, which has opened a new chapter in his case.)\n\nLamar dedicates the third verse to Drake's daughter, claiming that Drake is \"not active\" in her life and calling him a \"narcissist, misogynist.\" Drake denied claims he has a daughter on his Instagram story on Saturday.\n\nLamar doubled down on his allegations against Drake, releasing another four-and-a-half-minute track not even a full 24 hours later on Saturday evening. The cover art is allegedly a photo of Drake's mansion in Toronto with red markers that seem similar to the ones used to mark homes where sex offenders reside. \"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young,\" Lamar rapped.\n\nHe also says that Drake is not a \"colleague\" but a \"colonizer.\"\n\nLamar also called out Drake for using Tupac's AI voice: \"You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, n---a? I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop.\"\n\nMetro Boomin -- one of the producers on \"Like That\" -- put his foot in the game when he shared a post on X about a \"BBL Drizzy Beat Giveaway\" on May 5. The rapper encouraged fans to rap over the beat, which looks to be a sample of a parody song written by comedian and AI storyteller King Willonious, according to Complex.\n\nDrake mentioned Metro Boomin by his legal name in \"Family Matters,\" calling him \"lame\" and also alleging that he influenced disagreements between Drake and Future.\n\nDrake commented on an Instagram post sharing one of Metro Boomin's tweets about him writing, \"you just cheffed a beat about my a-s?\"\n\nThe most recent response to the beef came on Sunday night, when Drake released \"The Heart Part 6.\" In a post to X, he wrote, \"And we know you're dropping [six] minutes after, so instead of posting my address, you have a lot to address.\" He denies the allegations that Lamar lobbed at him, saying he purposefully fed Lamar fake information to see if he'd fall for it and tells him that he should get better at fact-checking. Drake called this beef a \"good exercise\" and laughed it off, suggesting that Lamar would be a \"worthy competitor if [he] was really a predator.\"\n\nDrake also directly mentioned Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown, saying that he \"Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager.\" This marks at least the second time Drake has responded to online criticism about his friendship with the actress, whom he first met when she was a young teen. Drake previously addressed comments about her in his song \"Another Late Night.\"\n\nThe Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar beef seems to have no end in sight as the two continue to trade disses with ever-increasing severity in the allegations made towards each other.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sean", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Sean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Adidon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Story of Adidon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Justice_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poetic Justice (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

"body": "US rapper Kendrick Lamar, seen performing in June 2023, has gone far beyond the usual jibes in his feud with Drake\n\nA long-simmering feud between rap titans Drake and Kendrick Lamar exploded into allegations of pedophilia, abuse and infidelity over the weekend, sending shockwaves through the world of hip hop and beyond.\n\nDrake, the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year, and Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner, have been locked in an escalating war of words in a music genre long known for celebrating and obsessing over beefs between its biggest stars.\n\nBut while the pair's previous exchanges have focused on disputes like which man is the bigger star, lyrics in tracks released by both artists over the past few days went far beyond the usual jibes.\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\" said Lamar in his track \"Not Like Us,\" in which he specifically raps about \"certified pedophiles.\"\n\nLos Angeles-born Lamar's lyrics accuse Drake, who is from Canada and is of biracial heritage, of being \"not a colleague\" but a \"colonizer\" of Black American culture.\n\nAnd in another song released this weekend, \"Meet the Grahams,\" Lamar alleges that Drake -- whose real name is Aubrey Graham -- has a secret daughter.\n\nFor his part, Drake dropped a track entitled \"Family Matters,\" which suggested infidelity and even abuse in Lamar's relationship with fiancee and high-school sweetheart Whitney Alford.\n\nAnd Drake denied allegations about underage girls in another track \"The Heart Part 6,\" released Sunday, in which he rapped \"I'd never look twice at no teenager.\"\n\nThe barbs have drawn attention among audiences well beyond the usual rap and hip hop devotees.\n\nThe feud was the subject of a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch this weekend, and detailed chronologies of the duo's insults have been published by mainstream US outlets like the New York Times and CNN.\n\n- 'Inevitable' -\n\nDrake, 37, and Lamar, 36, shot to mainstream hip hop fame in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nThey initially appeared on tracks on each other's albums, and even toured together.\n\nUS rapper Drake's barbs have drawn attention among audiences well beyond the usual rap and hip hop devotees\n\nIn the following years, bitter splits have emerged, as each man forged their own wildly successful path.\n\nDrake last year tied Michael Jackson as the male solo artist with the most number one songs in Billboard Hot 100 history, with 13 chart-topping tracks.\n\nLamar, whose poignant lyricism runs the gamut from personal insights to systemic issues such as race relations and structural poverty, has been frequently called the voice of a generation.\n\nFriendly competition has deteriorated into open barbs, in a moment that \"was inevitable,\" according to Rolling Stone magazine writer Andre Gee.\n\n\"The people who don't understand their rift haven't spent the last 15 to 20 years wanting to be regarded as the best rapper ever,\" he wrote.\n\nRap has been closely identified with bitter feuds between its major stars for decades.\n\nIn the early 1990s, stars like Tupac Shakur and The Notorious BIG became embroiled in a vaunted rivalry -- egged on by promoters -- between East Coast and West Coast hip hop.\n\nWhile that dispute ended in violence and tragedy, today's feud -- confined to lyrics and social media posts -- appears to have only whetted the appetite of some rap afficionados for more so-called \"diss tracks.\"\n\n\"It's anyone's guess where this goes from here with both rappers digging their heels in and firing at-will to close out a historic hip-hop weekend,\" wrote Billboard.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

In a different world, Aubrey Drake Graham might come off as Keyser S\u00f6ze on \"The Heart Part 6,\" the most recent volley (at least for now) in the extremely busy, extremely fun Drake/Kendrick Lamar feud. \"The Heart Part 6\" is the song where Drake says that he planted a fake story about having a secret 11-year-old daughter and says that Kendrick's \"Meet The Grahams\" cover art was a setup, a way to reel Kendrick in. But Drake doesn't sound like the master manipulator that he claims to be. Instead, he's beat-up, surly, tired. \"The Heart Part 6\" is a Band-Aid, a chance for any remaining Drake partisans to claim that he's really the winner of this past week's events. We know better.\n\nZack Fox might've said it best: \"somebody say you a sex criminal what you gon say 'nuh uh' ?\" A whole lot of \"The Heart Part 6\" is \"nuh uh.\" Against Kendrick Lamar's gleeful, persistent claims that Drake is a predator, Drake's response is to half-heartedly claim that there's nothing to \"the Epstein angle\" and that he's too successful to be a sex offender: \"I'm too respected/ If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested/ I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested.\" As if that's how it works! As if we haven't seen case after case of famous, successful people doing foul shit! Drake also says that Kendrick \"got molested\" and that that's \"why these pedophile raps is shit you so obsessed with.\" If this is the final chapter, then it's a sad little denouement to a story that's kept the whole rap world enraptured.\n\n\"The Heart Part 6\" could be the final chapter, or there could be another song that comes out seconds after I hit publish on this story. We don't know. That's why it's been so great. I fell asleep early on Friday night and woke up with absolutely ferocious new tracks from both Kendrick Lamar and Drake. The dust never gets a chance to settle. Since Kendrick started throwing explicit shots on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That\" a little more than a month ago, we've gotten a solid album's worth of material from two of rap's biggest names, both of them throwing constant toxic haymakers at one another. If you're the type of person who pays attention to rap's ongoing soap operas, then this is the type of shit that you live for. It's been way too much fun.\n\nOn the outro to \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drake is almost muttering to himself, but he hits on one reason that this feud has captivated so many: \"At least your fans are getting some raps out of you. I'm happy I could motivate you, bring you back to the game.\" Drake doesn't sound happy, but what he's saying is true. A couple of months ago, Kendrick Lamar was nowhere near the center of any conversation. In 2022, Kendrick ended a long absence with Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers With A Size 7 Men's On, an impressive but thorny and unfun album about self-discovering and morality and therapy. It had some powerful moments, but it wasn't the grand return that the world wanted from one of the best ever to do it. Kendrick couldn't bring that out of himself. Drake had to bring it out. Actually, J. Cole had to bring it out. People rightfully clowned Cole for dropping a halfhearted diss track and then immediately apologizing, but it's already clear that he made the right decision. He's much better off on the sidelines here.\n\nRumor has it that Drake tried to get Kendrick Lamar on \"First Person Shooter.\" Kendrick himself alludes to that rumor on \"Euphoria\": \"Surprised you wanted that feature request/ You know that we got some shit to address.\" I believe those rumors. A Drake/Cole/Kendrick collab would've made sense. All three are massive stars and generational talents. They've collaborated. They've shared stages. If you were looking to make a giant event record, a \"Swagga Like Us\" for 2023, then they're arguably the three guys you'd want to round up. But Drake and Kendrick don't like each other, and they haven't liked each other for a long time. That might not matter to Drake, but it matters to Kendrick. Kendrick's issues with Drake aren't just personal. They're philosophical, too.\n\nThe line that stung hardest on \"Like That\" was \"Prince outlived Mike Jack.\" You could infer a whole lot from it. Drake had just been crowing about catching up to Michael Jackson on the all-time list of artists with the most crossover chart-toppers, and Kendrick was disgusted. Prince and Michael Jackson were both artists and pop stars, but the mythology surrounding them was very different. In making that claim, Kendrick positioned himself as an artist to Drake's pop star. That's not exactly a destructo-ray of a line, and Drake could've just shook it off and returned to the business of throwing oblique shots at Kendrick once or twice on every album, as he's been doing for years. Instead, that Kendrick verse apparently gave a whole lot of other rappers and singers the signal that it was open season on Drake, a guy who's been on top for way too long and who's pissed a whole lot of people off along the way. In response, Drake did what he always does in situations like this. He taunted.\n\nMost of the time, Drake's taunting is extremely effective. When Meek Mill tried to take it to Drake years ago, he responded with \"Back To Back\" a taunting session so catchy and merciless that it ended the conversation. Drake went into that mode on \"Push Ups,\" and it worked pretty well. \"Push Ups\" isn't a devastating diss record or anything. It's too playful, too unfocused. Drake spends half of the track smacking down Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, the Weeknd, anyone else having problems with him. His Kendrick lines mostly revolve around contract splits, verses on pop records, and height jokes, and some of those lines are good. Drake went into weirder territory on \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" with the AI voice-filter hijinks and the Taylor Swift praise, but he still sounded brash and energetic. This was the old Drake, confident that Kendrick didn't really want any part of a real feud and that he was already cruising to victory. That's not how things worked out.\n\nThe moment that the first \"Euphoria\" beat switch kicked in, we had a battle on our hands. \"Euphoria\" is a miracle, a six-minute structure-free rap attack that's already become a huge hit. Mostly, it's a miracle because it gives us a version of Kendrick Lamar that really, really likes rapping. Kendrick brings his full arsenal to \"Euphoria\" -- the weird voices, the layered references, the way he lets his flow dissipate and then suddenly snaps back into focus. He attacks Drake passionately, from every angle, like Nas on \"Ether.\" Unlike Nas, though, Kendrick never sounds angry -- not even on the instantly famous \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\" bit. Instead, Kendrick is having fun. He's saying the shit that he's been wanting to say for a decade-plus, and he's savoring every moment.\n\nThere's plenty of strategy at work on \"Euphoria.\" Kendrick pokes at sensitive spots, hints at information that isn't public yet, and sets the framework for the ugliness to come. He insists that he wishes Drake all the success in the world, that he likes Drake with the melodies, but he makes it clear that this isn't how he really feels. Finally, the planets aligned in a way that allowed Kendrick to take Drake down, and wasn't going to waste it. He sounds unencumbered, free. The song picks up steam over its six minutes, and by the time the track ends, he's deep in the blackout zone. Nobody is upset that Kendrick got Joel Osteen and Haley Joel Osment confused because that's funny and also because Kendrick was just rolling by then. \"Euphoria\" is the great unburdening. Kendrick saved most of the strategy for the next record.\n\n\"6:16 In LA\" showed up on Kendrick Lamar's Instagram three days later, when the world was still waiting on Drake's response. Kendrick pulled straight from Drake's own playbook, going back-to-back before Drake's response was ready. Tellingly, \"6:16 In LA\" is the only one of Kendrick's four diss tracks that hasn't yet appeared on streaming services. It's not as purposeful as his other songs, nor as fun. Instead, it's Kendrick in taunt mode, letting Drake know that even the people in his own circle can't stand him. The subtext is just as important as the text -- a title that flips Drake's timestamp series, the sample of an Al Green song that featured Drake's uncle on guitar. Right after Drake said all that stuff about Taylor Swift, it was a mindfuck to learn that Kendrick got Jack Antonoff, Swift's main collaborator, to produce a diss track. The whole thing was set up to make Drake feel insecure, and only Drake can say whether it worked.\n\nIt might've worked. \"Family Matters\" is, quite simply, an excellent Drake diss track, one that would've sent most rappers into the Shadow Realm. Drake moonwalks all over this thing, handling three different beats with steely arrogance. It's not perfect. Drake devotes the middle of the three-part structure to attacking various peripheral figures. He scores some real points on them; the A$AP Rocky stuff is cold-blooded. Still, those asides make the whole thing sound less focused, as if Drake is being distracted from the real main event -- so consumed fighting off the Usos and Solo Sikoa that he doesn't see Roman Reigns ready to hit the spear. The homophobia is dumb, but that unfortunately goes for both sides here. The way that Drake tries to score points through mock concern for the woman in Kendrick's life is gross, but Kendrick, if anything, goes even further on that tactic. Drake really shouldn't have said that Kendrick raps like he's trying to free the slaves. But as a pure work of disrespectful art, \"Family Matters\" is heavy.\n\nOn \"Family Matters,\" Drake hits tons of catchy flows and melodies, and he gets ugly and personal in ways that Kendrick hadn't quite done yet. He tells Kendrick that one of his kids isn't really his, that his fianc\u00e9e wants nothing to do with him, and that he hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact -- he calls it a fact -- that Kendrick beats on his queen. This goes beyond anything in the Jay/Nas feud, into the land of \"I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.\" It's the best pure rapping that I've heard from Drake in a long time. He sounds unstoppable. He's not.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff in \"Family Matters\" that never even got a chance to resonate. The video for the track -- the subtitles, the Good Kid m.A.A.d. City van getting crushed up, the scenes in the Chinese restaurant that Kendrick just namechecked -- are all excellent rap gamesmanship. Other than Drake, almost nobody has addressed the allegations of domestic abuse. I think there's so much goodwill toward Kendrick that people don't even want to consider the possibility that it might be true. That, more than anything that Drake actually says on \"Family Matters,\" gets at the heart of this feud. People love Kendrick Lamar. Drake has had a world-historical career and done everything that a rapper could do. He's made a ton of great music, and he's been around forever. But most people just don't love him like that. It makes a difference.\n\nThe turnaround between \"Family Matters\" and \"Meet The Grahams\" was just ridiculous. Most people didn't even get a chance to hear \"Family Matters\" before Kendrick's rebuttal arrived. Drake's nastiest, most personal insults run up against Kendrick lines that are even nastier and more personal. It's masterful condescension -- Kendrick speaking to all the different people in Drake's family before turning his attention to the man himself. The revelation about Drake's possibly-fake daughter arrives like a Shyamalan plot-twist. If Drake really did plant that story with Kendrick's camp, then his four-dimensional chess game backfired on him. Even if that little bit of information isn't true, it still seems like some shit that he would've done. Objective reality cannot take away from how it felt to hear Kendrick accuse Drake of hiding another child.\n\nHere's what Drake doesn't seem to understand: It's not just the allegations. It's the performance, too -- Kendrick hitting a theatrically sinister register that's far beyond anything that he could do. It's also the disdain that accompanies the revelations. Even if Drake doesn't have other kids running around out there, he's still got a long history of using women as props, acting aggrieved all the time, and attempting to turn his insecurities into flexes. And Kendrick didn't let that stuff linger long before going back-to-back again.\n\nIf Drake ever had any hope at recovering and resetting the narrative, it disappeared when Kendrick dropped \"Not Like Us\" on Saturday night. What a joyous song. Kendrick rolls out more attacks on that one. Drake and Kendrick spent plenty of time calling each other's Blackness into question during the feud, and I'm not in any position to comment on that, but Kendrick is truly in his element when he calls Drake a colonizer and ties that to Atlanta history. The DJ Mustard beat is easily the funkiest thing to come out of the back-and-forth, and Kendrick's use of Drakeo-type flows is a clear sign that he's tapped into the music coming out of his own city, ready to claim it for his own. (Nobody's trying to call Kendrick a colonizer, and he knows that.) By the end of the song, Kendrick is just dancing on Drake's grave.\n\nDrake is a student of the game. It's one of the things that's kept him on top for so long, and it's one of the weapons that Kendrick uses against him. Drake is a fan. He's a fan of battle rap, the nerdiest version of rap that exists. (I say this with love because I'm a fan, too.) You can go back to old King Of The Dot videos and watch Drake reacting to the Pat Stay/Math Hoffa battle. The man booked Loaded Lux vs. Geechi Gotti for his own birthday party. So Drake understands exactly how it looks when a battler knows he's losing, when all of his rebuttals are falling flat. Drake only took a day to respond to \"Not Like Us,\" but he did it in the weakest ways, trying to flip Kendrick's \"A minor\" punchline into weak-ass puns. Right now, I expect Drake to claim victory and walk away. That's probably for the best. This fight has gotten very personal, and if it gets even more intense, then people might have trouble walking away. Nobody wants to see this turn into something else.\n\nFor now, what a show. What a time to be alive. The entire episode reminds me of Kanye West's GOOD Fridays -- one of the all-too-brief moments when a new song stops the world and forces everyone to react before they can resume their days. People will try to tell you that the Kendrick/Drake feud is overhyped or that it's too regressive or that the negativity of rap beef is played out. They'll tell you that the whole thing was set up to get attention from jump, that it's pro wrestling tactics in action. Fuck all that. This is what it's about. It's why we tune in. It's an event that's been building for years, and it hasn't been a disappointment.\n\nOver the weekend, the feud was the only thing that mattered in all of popular culture, at least on a frivolous level.

Drake's \"Family Matters\" song accused Lamar of being a \"make-believe\" activist, claimed Lamar got physically abusive with his wife, Whitney Alford, alleged that Alford cheated on Lamar with his creative partner, Dave Free, and hinted that Free is the real father of Lamar's son. (He didn't immediately comment on the allegations.)\n\nLamar responded with \"Meet the Grahams,\" in which he accused Drake of hiding an 11-year-old daughter, claimed the Canadian rapper lied about using Ozempic to lose weight and insinuated that Drake had \"gambling problems, drinking problems, pill-popping and spending problems.\" Lamar also accused Drake and his entourage of being \"predators,\" a claim he doubled down on in \"Not Like Us.\" In that track, Lamar said that Drake's camp is full of \"certified pedophiles.\"\n\nDrake quickly denied having a secret daughter and later released a track claiming that his camp fed Lamar false data about the hidden daughter. In that song, he also denied that he'd been with anyone \"underage.\"\n\nLamar had previously clashed with Drake, taking shots at the \"God's Plan\" rapper in 2013 while rapping on Big Sean's \"Control.\" Since then, the two have slung subliminal shade, but that all came to a head in March.\n\nFor those who need a refresher on how this beef got this far, scroll on for a quick rundown of all the diss tracks involved:\n\nThe unofficial start of the Lamar-Drake war came in October 2023 when Drake released For All the Dogs. The album contained \"First Person Shooter,\" a song featuring a verse from rapper J. Cole. \"Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?\" Cole rapped, referring to Lamar's nickname, \"K-Dot,\" and Drake's real name, Aubrey Graham.\n\nCole then suggested, \"We [ate] the big three like we started a league / But right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali.\"\n\n\"First Person Shooter\" went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Cole his first chart-topper. It was Drake's 13th Hot 100 No. 1.\n\nIn March, celebrated producer Metro Boomin teamed with Drake's frequent collaborator Future for the collaborative album We Don't Trust You. The song featured a verse from Lamar, in which he responded to Cole's \"big three\" comments. \"Motherf-k the big three / It's just big me,\" he rapped.\n\nLamar also took blatant shots at Drake, referencing how Drake compared himself to the late Michael Jackson. \"F-k sneak dissin' first person shooter / I hope they came with three switches,\" he rapped. \"What? I'm really like that / And your best work is a light pack / Prince outlived Mike Jack' / 'Fore all your dogs gettin' buried / That's a K with all these nines, he gon' see Pet Sematary.\"\n\nCole also said that Lamar was \"averaging one hard verse, like, every 30 months or something,\" and that if they were beefing, no one \"would be discussing\" Lamar. However, five days after releasing it, Cole took a moment during his Dreamville set to apologize for releasing the song. He regretted \"downplaying\" Lamar's catalog and his \"greatness.\" Cole called his response \"corny\" and eventually pulled the song from streaming services.\n\nFans initially mocked Cole online for bowing out of the battle so early. However, as the war intensified, many came around to credit Cole for understanding when to throw in the towel.\n\nRick Ross entered the feud shortly after \"Like That\" dropped by sharing a video of him smoking in a Rolls-Royce while listening to the track. He then further jumped into the fray on April 15 with \"Champagne Problems,\" which is a play on Drake's nickname \"Champagne Papi.\"\n\nRoss' diss track reiterated the well-circulated rumor that Drake uses ghostwriters. Ross also claimed that Drake got a nose job to look less like his Black father. He also said that Drake \"had that surgery, that six-pack gone / That's why you wearing that funny s-t at your show.\"\n\nRoss also began to refer to the biracial Drake as \"white boy,\" claiming that Drake was co-opting elements of Black culture and associating with other rappers for credibility. \"Another white boy at the park wanna hang with the crew,\" said Ross dismissively.\n\nFuture and Metro Boomin went back-to-back by releasing We Still Don't Trust You, their second collaborative album, on April 9. The album featured appearances by ASAP Rocky and The Weeknd. On \"Show of Hands,\" Rocky claimed that he had sex with Sophie Brussaux, the mother of Drake's son, Adonis. On \"All to Myself,\" The Weeknd said he was glad that he \"never signed my life away,\" likely referencing his decision not to sign with Drake's OVO Sound label in 2010.\n\nDrake responded to all the disses coming his way in mid-April with \"Push Ups.\" The song leaked on April 13, and many initially wondered whether it was real or another case of someone creating a track with AI-generated Drake vocals.\n\nThe song was indeed legit, and Drake officially released the track on April 19. In it, Drake fired back at Ross (\"Spend that lil' check you got and stay out of my business\"), Metro Boomin, Future, The Weeknd and Lamar.\n\nDrake attacked Lamar's height and shoe size. He also mocked Kendrick's hip-hop credibility by pointing out how he provided verses for pop songs including Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" and Maroon 5's \"Don't Wanna Know.\" Drake also mocked Lamar's record deal with Top Dawg Entertainment by claiming he split his earnings 50/50 with the label. He also claimed that Lamar isn't as great as he thinks, saying, \"You ain't in no big three / SZA got you wide down / Travis [Scott] got you wiped down / [21] Savage got you wiped down.\"\n\nDrake also noted that \"First Person Shooter\" didn't cause the war between him and Lamar, that \"this s-t's been brewin' in a pot\" for a while now.\n\nOn April 19, the same day that Drake put \"Push Ups\" on streaming services, he released \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\" The title was likely a reference to how Lamar hadn't responded to \"Push Ups\" yet because Swift was releasing The Tortured Poets Department that same Friday.\n\n\"The next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you / But now we gotta wait a f-kin' week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new top / And if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve,\" rapped Drake. \"This girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud / She tailor-made your schedule with [Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith], you out of the loop.\"\n\nDrake utilized AI-generated vocals for Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur on \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\" This move was done to mock Lamar, who cites the West Coast rap icons as influences. The Shakur estate wasn't happy with the use of his audio likeness without permission and sent a cease-and-desist to Drake, according to Billboard. Drake's team subsequently removed \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" from streaming services.\n\nKendrick took two weeks after \"Push Ups\" leaked to release his response on April 30, a six-minute-long rant called \"Euphoria.\" The title refers to the HBO series that Drake produces, and the track saw Lamar accuse Drake of being a \"scam artist with the hopes of being accepted\" by the rap community. Lamar also attacked Drake's parenting (\"I got a son to raise / But I can see you know nothin' 'bout that\"). Lamar repeated Ross' claims that Drake got cosmetic surgery to obtain his abs.\n\nWhile most fans considered the track a successful response because it showed Lamar's talents for rapping and switching up flows to match the changes of the beat, there were those who weren't impressed. They noted that Lamar didn't say anything new with the track and pointed out that he made a bizarre error confusing televangelist Joel Osteen with actor Haley Joel Osment.\n\nIn \"Euphoria,\" Lamar noted that he liked Drake's \"Back to Back\" record, a song recorded during his beef with Meek Mill. This was a subtle hint that Lamar wouldn't wait to release a second song, a promise he fulfilled on May 3 with \"6:16 in LA.\"\n\nThe song listed two of Swift's longtime creative partners -- Jack Antonoff and Sounwave -- as its producers, likely a nod to Drake using Swift's names in prior disses.\n\nIn his follow-up, Kendrick claimed to have people in Drake's OVO organization working for him. \"Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person / Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it / Can't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface / Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose,\" rapped Lamar.\n\nLamar dropped \"6:16 in LA\" on a Friday morning. Around 11:30 p.m. ET that same night, Drake released \"Family Matters,\" a nearly-eight-minute track. In the song, he alleged that Free -- Lamar's friend, manager and creative partner -- was the actual father of his son.\n\nDrake also alleged that Lamar got physically abusive with his wife and that they're currently estranged. He also claimed that Lamar's posturing as a Black activist was fake due to \"wifing up a mixed queen\" and \"hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem.\"\n\nThe corresponding video showed a minivan similar to the one on the cover of Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City being destroyed in a junkyard.\n\nLess than an hour after Drake released \"Family Matters,\" Lamar dropped \"Meet the Grahams.\" The lengthy diss saw Lamar address everyone in Drake's family, from his son, Adonis, to his mother and father. Lamar also addressed an 11-year-old girl, claiming that Drake had hidden this child away, similar to how he initially hid Adonis' birth from the public.\n\nLamar also used the track to allege that Drake has \"sex offenders\" on the OVO payroll while comparing Drake to disgraced filmmaker and convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein.\n\nLess than 24 hours after posting \"Meet the Grahams,\" Lamar shared \"Not Like Us.\" Whereas his prior two tracks were dour in tone and beat, Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" was a hyphy-influenced, energetic track where he accused the OVO company of being full of sex offenders. \"Certified Lover Boy / Certified pedophiles,\" he rapped. Lamar also repeated his claims that Drake used other rappers -- Lil Baby, 21 Savage, Young Thug, Quavo and 2 Chainz -- for credibility.\n\n\"You're not a colleague, you a f-kin' colonizer,\" claimed Lamar. \"The family matter and the truth of the matter / It was God's plan to show y'all the liar.\" Lamar didn't react on the track to Drake's allegations that he is estranged from his wife or that he physically abused her.\n\nDrake responded on May 5 with \"The Heart Part 6,\" a play on Lamar's \"The Heart\" series of songs. In this song, Drake claimed that his team fed Lamar false information about the 11-year-old daughter, his alleged Ozempic prescription and other tidbits. \"You gotta learn to fact-check things and be less impatient,\" he said. Drake also noted the \"Epstein angle was the s-t I expected\" before saying that if he \"was f-king young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested / I'm too famous for this s-t that you just suggested.\"\n\nAfter he released the track, \"Nah Drake\" trended on X. Many fans were not impressed with the song, and some noted that Drake misinterpreted Lamar's \"Mother I Sober\" (a song from Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers). Drake referenced it to say that Lamar was previously molested, but many fans pointed out that the song actually says the opposite of that.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_brow@usmagazine.com", "name": "Jason Brow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digi+Phonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digi+Phonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God's_Plan_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God's Plan (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

explodes", "body": "Los Angeles (AFP) - A long-simmering feud between rap titans Drake and Kendrick Lamar exploded into allegations of pedophilia, abuse and infidelity over the weekend, sending shockwaves through the world of hip hop and beyond.\n\nDrake, the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year, and Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner, have been locked in an escalating war of words in a music genre long known for celebrating and obsessing over beefs between its biggest stars.\n\nBut while the pair's previous exchanges have focused on disputes like which man is the bigger star, lyrics in tracks released by both artists over the past few days went far beyond the usual jibes.\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\" said Lamar in his track \"Not Like Us,\" in which he specifically raps about \"certified pedophiles.\"\n\nLos Angeles-born Lamar's lyrics accuse Drake, who is from Canada and is of biracial heritage, of being \"not a colleague\" but a \"colonizer\" of Black American culture.\n\nAnd in another song released this weekend, \"Meet the Grahams,\" Lamar alleges that Drake -- whose real name is Aubrey Graham -- has a secret daughter.\n\nFor his part, Drake dropped a track entitled \"Family Matters,\" which suggested infidelity and even abuse in Lamar's relationship with fiancee and high-school sweetheart Whitney Alford.\n\nAnd Drake denied allegations about underage girls in another track \"The Heart Part 6,\" released Sunday, in which he rapped \"I'd never look twice at no teenager.\"\n\nThe barbs have drawn attention among audiences well beyond the usual rap and hip hop devotees.\n\nThe feud was the subject of a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch this weekend, and detailed chronologies of the duo's insults have been published by mainstream US outlets like the New York Times and CNN.\n\n'Inevitable'\n\nDrake, 37, and Lamar, 36, shot to mainstream hip hop fame in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nThey initially appeared on tracks on each other's albums, and even toured together.\n\nIn the following years, bitter splits have emerged, as each man forged their own wildly successful path.\n\nDrake last year tied Michael Jackson as the male solo artist with the most number one songs in Billboard Hot 100 history, with 13 chart-topping tracks.\n\nLamar, whose poignant lyricism runs the gamut from personal insights to systemic issues such as race relations and structural poverty, has been frequently called the voice of a generation.\n\nFriendly competition has deteriorated into open barbs, in a moment that \"was inevitable,\" according to Rolling Stone magazine writer Andre Gee.\n\n\"The people who don't understand their rift haven't spent the last 15 to 20 years wanting to be regarded as the best rapper ever,\" he wrote.\n\nRap has been closely identified with bitter feuds between its major stars for decades.\n\nIn the early 1990s, stars like Tupac Shakur and The Notorious BIG became embroiled in a vaunted rivalry -- egged on by promoters -- between East Coast and West Coast hip hop.\n\nWhile that dispute ended in violence and tragedy, today's feud -- confined to lyrics and social media posts -- appears to have only whetted the appetite of some rap afficionados for more so-called \"diss tracks.\"\n\n\"It's anyone's guess where this goes from here with both rappers digging their heels in and firing at-will to close out a historic hip-hop weekend,\" wrote Billboard.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(The rapper is indeed from Toronto.)\n\nShe added that in Drake's track \"Push Ups,\" released last month, \"he questioned Kendrick's manhood, saying he wears a size seven shoe.\"\n\nThe sketch was inspired by the recent so-called diss tracks released by the two artists, reignited by Lamar's pointed lines about Drake and J. Cole in his verse on Future and Metro Boomin's track \"Like That.\"\n\nDrake and Lamar have since traded jabs on several subsequent tracks.\n\nThe pair weren't always at odds. In 2011, Lamar was featured on Drake's \"Buried Alive Interlude\" track and collaborated once more in 2012 on Lamar's \"Poetic Justice.\" The long-running feud dates as far back as 2013, when Lamar first took aim at Drake and a number of other rappers on Big Sean's 2013 track \"Control.\"\n\nLipa pulled double duty on \"SNL\" over the weekend, serving as both the host and musical guest.

I think we're finally done...I think. You never know with this beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nOne moment, you're sitting there minding your business, thinking things are chill. The next moment there's a new song out from one of these two with a bunch of lyrics to dissect about how the other person is the worst human being on the planet.\n\nIt's been wild. Things have gotten pretty nasty. Plenty has been said that probably can't (and won't!) ever be taken back. There's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube on this one.\n\nREAD MORE: Kendrick Lamar eviscerates Drake on Euphoria\n\nThat said, the music has been incredible. There's been plenty of good, lots of great, and some bad to go with it, of course. I figured now is a good time to look at it all. So let's do it.\n\nBefore we do, let me be clear about my criteria:\n\nThis is about ranking the songs as diss tracks -- not just songs. How good these songs are musically does matter, of course. If a song sounds bad it doesn't really matter how disrespectful it is. But if it's disrespectful and it sounds great? That's a huge bonus.\n\nAt the core of everything, though, these songs are meant to attack an opponent. The songs I believe accomplished that the best will be the songs at the top of this ranking.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's dive into it.\n\nWARNING: There is lots of NSFW language in these videos\n\nMeet The Grahams\n\nThe only way to describe this track is sinister. It's so good, yet so evil at the very same time. From the very moment the first key plays on this joint, you know it's go-time. Nothing good was coming from this song.\n\nThis was Kendrick Lamar reading Drake for filth to his entire family. It's bad. Really bad. Yet, it's so captivating. You can't stop listening to it despite how menacing it is.\n\nIt doesn't stop there with this one -- it also completely derailed a song Drake dropped just mere moments before this one was released. It was like Drake dropped a bomb and then Kendrick responded with an even bigger one.\n\nThis is going to go down as one of the greatest diss tracks in history.\n\nNot Like Us\n\nIf \"Meet the Grahams\" was a knockout punch, then \"Not Like Us\" was the trot around the ring holding the championship belt. Kendrick linked up with DJ Mustard to bring the vibes of the Bay Area to this battle.\n\nNot only is this a brilliant assassination of Drake's character, but it also goes up in the club. Folks have been jamming out to it all weekend long.\n\nThat's got to be wild, man.\n\nFamily Matters\n\nThis song is so good, man. Drake was in his bag with this one. He showcased his technical skill as a rapper so well, switching flows over three different beats while lyrically eviscerating his detractors in it. He didn't waste a bar here.\n\nHe flexed on Kendrick Lamar and also got a bit personal in talking about his family. I wanted to place this might higher on the list, but I couldn't. He spent too much time talking about others instead of just Kendrick. On top of that, it was completely stepped on an hour later.\n\nLike That\n\nThis was the song that started it all. Kendrick Lamar came on here throwing shots at Drake and J Cole for aiming at him with First Person Shooter. In just a few bars, he sparked one of the greatest moments in Hip-Hop history.\n\nIt's more of a catchy song than a perfect diss, but it definitely got the job done here.\n\nEuphoria\n\nThis one was a warning shot from Kendrick Lamar. He warned Drake not to talk about his family. If it happened, there would be consequences.\n\nThere were several warnings with this one that have been stuck in my head all weekend. \"This a friendly fade -- you should keep it that way.\" That was a warning. He gave another in the end, too: \"If you take it there, I'm taking it further. That's not something you want to do.\"\n\nDrake didn't listen. The rest is history.\n\nPush-Ups\n\nAh, man. The good old days. Remember when Drake thought this was all fun and games when he released Push Ups? He thought he could get by by just throwing some short jokes at Kendrick Lamar and talking about his contract. Little did he know what was coming a few weeks later.\n\nHonestly, if he spent more time aiming at Kendrick with this one instead of the other people taking shots at him, this might be ranked a bit higher.\n\nTaylor Made Freestyle\n\nUsing artificial intelligence to create verses from two of Kendrick Lamar's idols in Tupac and Snoop Dogg is a clever tactic -- even if it's probably not a good look for the music industry at large.\n\nIn the end, it's become forgotten after the Tupac estate demanded it be removed. But the lyrics certainly dealt a slight blow to Lamar.\n\n6:16 in LA\n\nWhen this song released on Friday it felt like a big blow from Kendrick. It was him telling Drake how his friends are turning against him and feeding information Kendrick's way. It was a big body blow, at the time.\n\nBut, as it turns out, it wasn't even his best follow-up yet.\n\nThe Heart Part 6\n\nThe Heart Part 6 is a clever angle in a vacuum. This is Drake making the next installment in Kendrick Lamar's \"The Heart\" series, which is something his rival's fans love.\n\nBut this wasn't made in a vacuum. It was after K Dot's blitz over the weekend with 6:16 in LA, Meet the Grahams and Not Like Us. This song feels like an unofficial white flag. Especially after hearing Drake say \"You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later.\" It sounds like he's done.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_d_sykes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Mike D.

In the Lamar diss, \"Not Like Us,\" which dropped on Saturday, the California rapper accused Drizzy of pursuing underage girls. He also claimed his former friend used Atlanta rappers to further grow his career. Apparently, none of this sat right with Aubrey, who used \"The Heart Part 6\" to address many of these accusations, beginning with the more serious of them.\n\nDrake denied having relations with underage girls\n\n\"I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with/ Just for clarity, I feel disgusted / I'm too respected / If I was f****n' young girls, I promise I done been arrested / I'm way too famous for the s**t you just suggested, but that's not the lesson / Clearly there's a deeper message / Deep cuts that never healed and now they got infected.\"\n\nFor years, there have been rumors surrounding the Toronto superstar secretly dating underage girls, starting with actress Millie Bobby Brown. In 2018, while she was 14, she revealed that Drake had texted her \"boy advice.\" While both have maintained that their exchanges were innocent, their affiliation has continued to spark debate. There is also a video that has resurfaced since the rap battle showing Drake on stage with a 17-year-old fan, asking \"why do you look like that?\" and telling her she is thick. Still, Drake and many of his fans have slammed any notion that he was being inappropriate with teenagers.\n\nDrake claimed he had people in his team give Lamar fake information\n\n\"The one before the last one, we finessed you into telling a story that doesn't even exist\n\nAnd then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up/ I would like that one, that w-, that, that would be some s**t I could dance to if you wasn't triplin' down on some whole other bulls**t.\"\n\nDuring Kendrick Lamar's \"6:16 in LA,\" which was released Friday morning, he claimed Drizzy was hiding a daughter. This led many fans to go digging for evidence of this, though according to Drake, he purposely had people in his camp feed this fake information to Lamar.\n\nDrake accused Kendrick Lamar of beefing with him to promote his forthcoming album\n\n\"Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doing hard labor/ N***a, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia/ And Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor.\"\n\nLamar is rumored to have an album dropping soon, which Drake has theorized is the reason for his vitriol towards him.\n\nNeither side has provided substantial receipts to back their many claims, though it's unlikely that will stop them from going head-to-head anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baller Alert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_Bobby_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millie Bobby Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(singer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantasia (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://balleralert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-design-43.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541231", "eventUri": "eng-9541231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

escalating war of words\n\nThe long-simmering feud exploded into allegations of paedophilia, abuse and infidelity, sending shock waves through the world of hip hop and beyond\n\nA long-simmering feud between rap titans Drake and Kendrick Lamar exploded into allegations of paedophilia, abuse and infidelity over the weekend, sending shock waves through the world of hip hop and beyond.\n\nDrake, the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year, and Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner, have been locked in an escalating war of words in a music genre long known for celebrating and obsessing over beefs between its biggest stars.\n\nBut while the pair\u2019s previous exchanges have focused on disputes such as which man is the bigger star, lyrics in tracks released by both artists over the past few days went far beyond the usual jibes.\n\n\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d said Lamar in his track Not Like Us, in which he specifically raps about \u201ccertified paedophiles\u201d.\n\nLos Angeles-born Lamar\u2019s lyrics accuse Drake, who is from Canada and is of biracial heritage, of being \u201cnot a colleague\u201d but a \u201ccoloniser\u201d of black American culture.\n\nAnd in another song released this weekend, Meet the Grahams, Lamar alleges that Drake \u2013 whose real name is Aubrey Graham \u2013 has a secret daughter.\n\nFor his part, Drake dropped a track titled Family Matters, which suggested infidelity and even abuse in Lamar\u2019s relationship with fianc\u00e9e and high-school sweetheart Whitney Alford.\n\nAnd Drake denied allegations about underage girls in another track The Heart Part 6, released Sunday, in which he rapped \u201cI\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d.\n\nThe barbs have drawn attention among audiences well beyond the usual rap and hip-hop devotees.\n\nThe feud was the subject of a Saturday Night Live sketch this weekend, and detailed chronologies of the duo\u2019s insults have been published by mainstream US outlets such as The New York Times and CNN.\n\nDrake, 37, and Lamar, 36, shot to mainstream hip hop fame in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nThey initially appeared on tracks on each other\u2019s albums, and even toured together.\n\nIn the following years, bitter splits have emerged, as each man forged their own wildly successful path.\n\nDrake last year tied with Michael Jackson as the male solo artist with the most number one songs in Billboard Hot 100 history, with 13 chart-topping tracks.The people who don\u2019t understand their rift haven\u2019t spent the last 15 to 20 years wanting to be regarded as the best rapper everRolling Stone writer Andre Gee\n\nLamar, whose poignant lyricism runs the gamut from personal insights to systemic issues such as race relations and structural poverty, has been frequently called the voice of a generation.\n\nFriendly competition has deteriorated into open barbs, in a moment that \u201cwas inevitable\u201d, according to Rolling Stone magazine writer Andre Gee.\n\n\u201cThe people who don\u2019t understand their rift haven\u2019t spent the last 15 to 20 years wanting to be regarded as the best rapper ever,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRap has been closely identified with bitter feuds between its major stars for decades.\n\nIn the early 1990s, stars such as Tupac Shakur and The Notorious BIG became embroiled in a vaunted rivalry \u2013 egged on by promoters \u2013 between East Coast and West Coast hip hop.\n\nWhile that dispute ended in violence and tragedy, today\u2019s feud \u2013 confined to lyrics and social media posts \u2013 appears to have only whetted the appetite of some rap afficionados for more \u201cdiss tracks\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where this goes from here with both rappers digging their heels in and firing at-will to close out a historic hip-hop weekend,\u201d wrote Billboard.", "source": {"uri":

Kendrick accused Drake of being a pedophile and keeping sex offenders on his OVO payroll on the track \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nRumors have swirled that Drake has had a knack for younger women for years; Kendrick just put the accusations on wax. In a cringey response titled \"The Heart Part 6\" (a play on Kendrick's \"The Heart Part 5\"), Drake defends himself by saying he expected Kendrick to call him a child predator.\n\nSir, what?\n\n\"This Epstein angle was the sh*t I expected/TikTok videos you collected and dissected,\" Drake rapped. Sadly, it gets worse from there. \"Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected/\"If I was f**king young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested/I'm way too famous for this sh*t you just suggested.\"\n\nDrake essentially stated that if he was engaging in nefarious activity, his celebrity status would have ensured his downfall by now -- as if Hollywood hasn't worked to protect the most notorious predators since its inception.\n\nHe went on to name one particular actress who he allegedly tried to be inappropriate with -- though Kendrick never did. \"Only f**kin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns/I'd never look twice at no teenager/I'm a f**king hitmaker, dog, not a peacemaker.\"\n\nThe \"For All The Dogs\" emcee's latest reply comes across as a confession more than a diss track. In \"The Heart Part 6,\" Drizzy also said that whoever gave Kendrick dirt on him was a clown. Then Drake stated that his team purposely fed misinformation to the Compton native -- which would make Drake the clown?\n\n\"We finessed you into telling a story that doesn't even exist,\" Drake said on the track, referring to Kendrick's claims that he's hiding an 11-year-old daughter. However, blogs wrote about Drake's alleged second secret child years ago.\n\nPerhaps most sadly, Drake attempted to shame Kendrick for his song \"Mother I Sober.\" The song appeared on Kendrick's fifth album, \"Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers,\" which was released in 2022.

Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and A$AP Rocky. It's been a strange few weeks, with shots being thrown in an extremely public and increasingly amusing way. In an utterly baffling move, Cole made a public apology for his own diss track, bowing out of the beef early. Meanwhile, like any argument you might see among a group of rich women on Bravo, Drake is being put on blast for his rumored plastic surgery. (Thank you, Megan Thee Stallion.)\n\nThis isn't the first time this particular group of A-listers -- all of whom dominated the mainstream rap charts of the 2010s -- have exchanged lyrical blows. In particular, Drake and Lamar have sneak-dissed each other for a while now. However, to the average music listener, all these men have a more well-known history of collaboration, including features, a joint album, and tour stops. Lamar's fiery verse, however, on the We Don't Trust You track \"Like That,\" has shattered any remaining semblance of camaraderie.\n\nIn the weeks since, Future and Metro have released yet another rage-fueled album, hilariously titled We Still Don't Trust You. Drake clunkily released his own sprawling diss, \"Push Ups,\" name-dropping everyone from SZA to Maroon 5 to Swifties. (Did I mention Uma Thurman is also involved?) Lamar responded with two back-to-back disses: first, the scathing track \"euphoria,\" and, later, \"6:16 in LA,\" which had a surprising producer credit from Taylor Swift's righthand man, Jack Antonoff. Over the weekend, though, tensions between Lamar and Drake reached a fever pitch. The rappers exchanged several explosive diss tracks with some pretty dark, criminal allegations. It was Kendrick who ultimately seemed more prepared.\n\nAfter nearly 15 tumultuous years in the game, it's no surprise that Drake has once again found himself on the receiving end of some hate. At first, it seemed like this latest feud was exactly what rap's sensitive king needed in a rather uninspired era in his career, defined by a rather dull musical output and gross jabs at women. However, following Lamar's verbal lashings, a PR cleanup may be needed.\n\nA few weeks ago, Future and Metro essentially released a breakup album from their frequent collaborator and former comrade, Drake. (Drake and Future have nearly 30 collaborations combined, and Metro executive-produced their 2015 mixtape What A Time to Be Alive.) We Don't Trust You is packed with subliminal messages seemingly directed at Drake, regarding his shady maneuvers. However, it was Kendrick's relatively gentle prodding on the track \"Like That\" that was ultimately the most incendiary.\n\nOn the track -- which has sat at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks in a row now -- he raps \"Motherfuck the big three, it's just big me,\" renouncing his informal association with rap peers Drake and Cole. On the recent Drake song \"First Person Shooter,\" off his latest album For All the Dogs, Cole claimed on his guest verse that he, Drake, and Lamar are the \"Big 3\" of the current era of hip-hop. Nevertheless, Lamar's ire on \"Like That\" is mostly pointed at his noted frenemy Drake, brushing off his purportedly unstoppable commercial success. \"Your best work is a light pack,\" he asserts. \"N -- , Prince outlived Mike Jack.\"\n\nCole responded first on April 5 with the track \"7-Minute Drill,\" featured on his aptly titled mixtape Might Delete Later. Cole throws shots at Lamar's Pulitzer Prize-winning discography, calling his latest album Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers \"tragic\" and claiming his Grammy-winning sophomore album Good Kid, Maad City \"put [listeners] to sleep.\" He also promises to \"humble\" Lamar if \"push comes to shove.\"\n\nHowever, by April 10, Cole had rescinded his warning shot, including removing \"7-Minute Drill\" from streaming platforms. At his annual Dreamville Festival, he issued a heavily mocked quasi-apology to Lamar. \"I tried to jab [Lamar] back, and I try to keep it friendly,\" he told the crowd in North Carolina. \"But at the end of the day when I listen to it, and when it comes out and I see the talk, that don't sit right with my spirit.\"\n\nBefore Drake could unleash his own diss, Future and Metro released the follow-up, We Still Don't Trust You, on April 12. This time, A$AP Rocky got some punches in. On the song \"Show of Hands,\" he rapped \"N -- s in they feelings over women. What, you hurt or something? I smash before you birthed, son. Flacko hit it first, son.\" This is presumably a response to Drake apparently dissing A$AP and his partner Rihanna, whom Drake previously dated, on his song \"Fear of Heights.\" (Fans have also speculated that A$AP means he previously slept with the mother of Drake's son.)\n\nAnother one of Drake's most famous industry mates, The Weeknd, appears on both Future and Metro albums. However, on We Still Don't Trust You's eighth track, \"All to Myself,\" he sings, \"I thank God that I never signed my life away.\" Fans interpreted that as a jab about Drake's label OVO Sound, which, despite his heavy association with the label, The Weeknd ultimately never signed to.\n\nOn Saturday, April 13, Drake's long-awaited response titled \"Push Ups (Drop & Give Me Fifty)\" mysteriously made its way to the internet. The seemingly unmixed demo made many social media users speculate whether the song was AI-generated before noted hip-hop commentator DJ Akademiks eventually played it -- noticeably with some tweaks, like the omission of a line about P. Diddy and a different beat -- on his livestream. Hip-hop radio station Power 105 also streamed a high-quality version of the song. Given Drake's comments on Instagram over the weekend, including a photo of Uma Thurman single-handedly taking on a group of fighters in the 2003 film Kill Bill, all signs point to the track being legitimate.\n\nThat said, \"Push Ups\" is a hefty (and expectedly humorous) diss record, taking aim at Drake's aforementioned opps while pulling some other parties into the crossfire. One of them is the Weeknd's manager, CashXO, who he accuses of \"blowing Abel's bread trickin.\" He also takes shots at Memphis Grizzlies player Ja Morant, who fans are speculating he was previously in a love triangle with.\n\nIn probably the silliest development of this multi-pronged feud, he throws some digs at rapper Rick Ross, another frequent collaborator of his. \"This n -- turning 50,\" Drake raps. \"Every song that made it on the chart he got it from Drizzy.\" Ross swiftly followed up with his own diss called \"Champagne Moments,\" which quickly went viral. Among other insults and accusations, he calls Drake, who's mixed, \"white boy\" and claims he got a nose job.\n\nAs for Lamar, Drake offers a pretty comprehensive rebuttal, poking fun at Lamar for apparently wearing a \"size 7 shoe\" and his collaborations with pop acts like Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\" (Lest we forget, Drake has also linked up with Swift for a check.) He also names some artists who he feels have surpassed Lamar's stardom, including SZA, who's signed to Lamar's own Top Dawg Entertainment label. (She apparently doesn't want to be involved.) There's also a bar that many listeners, including DJ Akademiks, interpreted as an audacious mention of Lamar's fianc\u00e9, Whitney Alford (\"I be with some bodyguards like Whitney\"). However, this could also be a misreading of a more obvious reference to the Whitney Houston film, The Bodyguard.\n\nAhead of Lamar dropping his response, \"euphoria,\" Drake released another diss track for Lamar on April 19 called \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" using AI-generated vocals from 2Pac and Snoop Dogg to \"spit\" on his behalf. Drake's weaponization of artificial intelligence, specifically regarding the deceased Tupac Shakur, generated mixed responses online. Some fans were amused by his \"innovation,\" while others, including Snoop, seemed downright confused. However, after his and Lamar's most recent round of disses, these criticisms would be the least of his concerns.\n\nOn April 30, Lamar finally dropped his rebuttal titled \"euphoria\" on streaming platforms. He spends most of the 6-minute track poking holes in Drake's public persona. Among other digs, he questions the Canadian rapper's proximity to Black American culture and his relationships with women. A few days later, Lamar followed up with \"6:16 in LA,\" claiming that Drake has a \"leak\" in his camp.\n\nPresumably, Drake wanted to get ahead of any dirt Lamar could possibly expose by dropping the track \"Family Matters\" this past Friday, along with a music video. In addition to Lamar, Drake has some more words for Ross, The Weeknd, and even Pharrell Williams. However, it's Lamar's fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Alford, who's the primary target of Drake's claims.\n\nFirst, he suggests that one of Lamar's children is actually fathered by his general manager, Dave Free, who's also the former president of Lamar's former label, Top Dawg Entertainment. Then he makes the more troubling allegation that Lamar \"puts his hands on\" Alford. \"They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen,\" he says at the end of the track.\n\nSeemingly tipped off by a mole, Lamar followed up just a few minutes later with \"meet the grahams,\" with cover art featuring a box of the weight-loss drug Ozempic supposedly prescribed to Drake. In that song, Lamar addresses his verses to Drake's son, Adonis, and Drake's parents. \"Dear Adonis, I'm sorry that man is your father,\" he bluntly opens the track. He also dedicated a verse to Drake's alleged 11-year-old daughter, who would be the second child the rapper has kept hidden from the public. Drake, however, was quick to jump on Instagram and shut down the claim that he had a secret daughter.\n\nMore strikingly, though, Lamar refers to Drake as a \"predator\" and even likens him to Harvey Weinstein. Later that evening, Lamar dropped yet another track -- this time, produced by DJ Mustard, who seemingly also has beef with Drake -- \"Not Like Us,\" where he outright calls Drake a \"pedophile.\" In particular, social media lost it over the triple entendre, \"tryna strike a chord, and it's probably A-minor.\"\n\nOn May 5, it seemed like Drake was ready to bow out after releasing the track \"The Heart Part 6.\" In addition to the curious claim that he purposely planted false information for Lamar to use, he spends most of the song denying that he sleeps with underage girls. He even addresses a controversial incident from 2018, when Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown, who was then 14 years old, stated in an interview that she texted the rapper about boys.\n\nIn a haphazard move, Drake attempts to connect these claims to Lamar's own trauma, referencing the \"one record where [Lamar] said [he] got molested\" titled \"Mother I Sober\" -- only Lamar doesn't state that he was sexually abused on the song. In rapping about his cousin who was accused of sexual assault, he claims twice on the track that his cousin didn't touch him, despite his family not believing him.\n\nDrake ends the song with a rambling spoken outro, similar to Nicki Minaj's Megan Thee Stallion diss \"Big Foot\" earlier this year. \"I'm not going to lie,\" he says. \"This shit was some good exercise.\" In a noticeably exhausted tone, he says \"it is what it is,\" seemingly waving a white flag.\n\nFor the most part, Drake has handled his public gang-up with an expected sense of humor and irreverence. However, with the latest releases, he seems to be fighting a battle he can't win, using wishy-washy bars to attempt to toss off some serious allegations. It's worth noting that Drake's domestic-abuse claims against Lamar are just as serious. Nevertheless, rap fans on social media seem more invested in the seedy gossip that's surrounded Drake's mostly private romantic life, including these unsettling accusations about underage girls. Plus, after years of dominating the rap scene and making enemies out of several rappers, it seems social media users are ready to see the rapper taken down a few pegs.\n\nAs anyone who's even slightly followed rap over the past decade and a half can attest, this isn't Drake's first time engaging in warfare with his peers. Most famously, his career has seen headline-generating battles with Meek Mill, Pusha T, Joe Budden, and Kanye West. Arguably, his most infamous tiff was the culmination of a long-brewing beef with Pusha T in 2018, where the Virginia rapper exposed Drake's formerly hidden son, Adonis, to the world.\n\nDespite the brief moment of humiliation, Drake ultimately emerged the victor -- that is, if you're using chart numbers and general popularity as a determining metric. After his moderately received victory lap of an album, Views, he was given a more gripping narrative to fuel his blockbuster 2018 album Scorpion. At the same time, he was once again proving his mass appeal outside of the rap audiences with party bangers like \"God's Plan,\" \"Nice For What,\" and \"In My Feelings,\" all of which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMore recently, however, Drake has been involved in several seemingly one-sided beefs with famous women. On his 2023 song with 21 Savage, \"Circo Loco,\" he threw out a not-so-subtle diss at rapper Megan Thee Stallion (\"This bitch lie 'bout getting shots but she still a stallion\"), joining a chorus of famous men disputing her now-proven claims that singer Tory Lanez shot her in the foot in 2020.\n\nDuring the rollout of For All the Dogs, he vexed actor Halle Berry, who claimed he used a photo of her for the artwork for his single \"Slime You Out\" without her permission. Additionally, he's attempted to reignite drama with his former fling Rihanna. Aside from his digs on \"Fear of Heights,\" he played their collaboration \"Work\" at one of his concerts just to claim that he \"doesn't sing [the] song anymore.\"\n\nDrake's songwriting is often propelled by a sweeping sense of grievance and an obsession with the past and his haters (he's not that different from Taylor Swift after all!). However, his constant feelings of victimhood within his relationships with women -- and the subsequent, more blatant misogyny that's grown out of that -- has begun to wear on critics and parts of his female fanbase. It's an observation that Lamar has sharply utilized in his diss tracks over the weekend.\n\nWhile this latest beef originally seemed like an ultimately invigorating experience for Drake in a snoozy part of his career, Lamar's accusations of pedophilia and other predatory behavior will presumably leave a strong stench on Drake's public image. It'll be fascinating to see whether the seemingly invincible rapper can maintain fans' respect after such dark claims. However, history has proven that male rappers can still thrive despite the most sordid allegations.", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyndall_cunningham@vox.com", "name": "Kyndall Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SZA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uma_Thurman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uma Thurman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_5", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maroon 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASAP_Rocky", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ASAP Rocky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drill music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixtape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Houston", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whitney Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Akademiks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DJ Akademiks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azealia_Banks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azealia Banks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Sign up for Honey today!\n\nA simmering competition between rap superstars Kendrick Lamar and Drake has combusted into a full-blown feud, with both artists deploying highly personal attacks in recently released diss tracks. The tracks, which arrived within days of each other, transcend the typical boasts and wordplay of hip-hop battles, venturing into sensitive territory like sexual assault and domestic violence. This escalation raises questions about the motivations behind their public acrimony and the potential impact on hip-hop culture.\n\nRap beefs and diss tracks are an integral part of hip-hop culture, fueling lyrical battles that shape legacies and push the boundaries of the genre. The recent Drake and Kendrick exchange stands as a testament to this tradition, echoing the intensity of legendary feuds like Nas and Jay-Z and demonstrating the enduring power of competition within the art form.\n\nTo date, Lamar and Drake have released 8 tracks dissing each other (four from Drake and four from Lamar), and many are considering it the greatest rap battle of all time.\n\n\"They both gave us what I believe to be the greatest rap battle I have ever witnessed, personally,\" said The Breakfast Club radio host Charlamagne tha God on Monday. \"The two best of their generation in their prime. Never had a rap battle given us this much music. Every time one of them drops, the other person answered and musically, I don't think either one of them missed a beat.\n\nThe current Kendrick-Drake feud becomes even more complex when considering the recent resurfacing of sexual assault accusations against Sean Combs, better known as Diddy. Diddy, a major figure in hip-hop with significant influence on both Kendrick and Drake, has faced allegations for over two decades.\n\nWhile the accusations against Diddy haven't been proven, their presence in the background casts a long shadow over this current situation where rappers are throwing around abuse allegations in hopes to one up each other. It's important to note that without evidence, these accusations could be seen as opportunistic rather than a genuine stand against sexual assault.\n\nBecause Kendrick and Drake's recent exchange isn't the only one that highlights the trend. Chris Brown and Quavo's recent diss tracks similarly trade allegations of domestic violence, with both artists calling each other out for abusing their former girlfriends.\n\nThe trend has survivors and advocates asking: Does the exploitation of serious allegations for lyrical warfare undermine important social movements like #MeToo and trivialize genuine experiences of abuse?\n\nDrake initiated the hostilities with \"Family Matters,\" a three-part diss track. He accuses Lamar of hypocrisy regarding his pro-Black activism, questioning the authenticity while implying Lamar abuses his partner, Whitney Alford. Lines like \"They hired a crisis management team/To clean up the fact that you beat on your queen\" cast a dark shadow on Lamar's character.\n\nKendrick retaliated swiftly with \"Meet The Grahams,\" turning the tables by accusing Drake of being a predator and running a sex trafficking ring on his label OVO. On \"Not Like Us\" he raps, referencing a sex offender statistic about pedophiles being more likely to being killed in prison than other inmates: \"Say Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one.\" They're shocking allegations, potentially leveraging the #MeToo movement against Drake.\n\nThe current accusations lobbed at Kendrick by Drake regarding domestic violence are particularly striking because Kendrick has previously addressed such issues in his work.\n\nIn a candid interview with Charlamagne Tha God on The Breakfast Club radio show in 2018, Kendrick was directly questioned about past lyrics that some perceived as condoning violence against women. He acknowledged the potential harm of such language and expressed a desire to evolve as an artist and advocate for positive change.\n\nKendrick's latest album, \"Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,\" released in 2022, contains introspective tracks that grapple with themes of trauma, relationships, and personal growth. While there aren't any explicit references to domestic violence, some have interpreted the song \"Auntie Diaries\" as a reflection on generational cycles of abuse and Lamar's own commitment to breaking them.\n\nDrake, on the other hand, publicly addressed the pedophile allegations in his latest diss track, \"The Heart Part 6,\" rapping, \"I never been with no one underage.\" No sexual abuse allegations against Drake have been documented in the past however, fans were upset when his dad was publicly recorded victim blaming by TMZ in 2018.\n\nSo, what's driving the beef? The exact cause for the rap escalation remains unclear. Some speculate it stems from a simmering tension that's been brewing for years. Others point to subliminal messages exchanged in past tracks. Without concrete evidence, the motives remain shrouded in speculation.\n\nThis rap battle goes beyond entertainment. Accusations of sexual assault and domestic violence have serious consequences for both the accused and survivors. By weaponizing these issues, Kendrick and Drake diminish their gravity and set a dangerous precedent within an industry where lyrics often blur with reality.\n\nTheir talent as lyricists is undeniable, but invoking sexual misconduct trivializes survivors' experiences and undermines the ongoing fight for accountability within the #MeToo movement.\n\nWhile hip-hop battles traditionally embrace no-holds-barred attacks, the #MeToo era has shifted the landscape, making sexual violence allegations far weightier. This exchange risks desensitizing listeners to these issues, potentially discouraging survivors from coming forward.\n\nIt also raises the question of artistic responsibility, particularly for figures with significant influence. Does artistic expression justify weaponizing social movements for personal gain?\n\nRegardless, fans may be feeling that it's gone too far.\n\nWhat's at the bottom of Drake and Kendrick #MeToo-ing each other? Unfortunately, the answer isn't clear. It could be a calculated strategy to gain the upper hand, a sign of a deeper personal animosity, or a combination of both.\n\nThis is uncharted territory for both rappers.

While he didn't say anything specific the move was a clear indicator that he was taking Drake's side in his impossible to escape rap beef with Kendrick Lamar. The spat between rap's most popular artist and its most critically acclaimed has divided fans. The pair threw out rapid fire diss tracks and responses throughout the weekend. Though we may be approaching the end at least from Drake's side of things, fans will likely be debating the massive amount of material both rappers dropped for weeks.\n\nSo much has happened since his last comment that fans would surely forgive Jay Electronica if he had a change of heart. But he choose instead to double down on his stance that Drake is winning in even clearer words than before. \"As a qualified observer. Drake punishing these boys. I don't care what nobody say. Don't @ me. You're not qualified,\" part of a tweet he made over the weekend reads. He's seemingly using his status as a rapper who has been embroiled in his beefs before to take an authoritative position on the situation. Check out his full comments below.\n\nRead More: Jay Electronica Comments On Drake Battle In The Most Jay Elect Way Possible\n\nThe most recent diss track to be released in the beef is Drake's \"The Heart Part 6\" which dropped yesterday. In the song Drake claimed that he actually planted the viral story Kendrick Lamar spread about him having a second hidden child. He also finishes the song by claiming he's done with this specific beef and won't be dropping anything else. That's in stark contrast to Kendrick, who claims he still has numerous songs ready to go.\n\nWhat do you think of Jay Electronica doubling down on his take that Drake is winning his beef with Kendrick Lamar? Do you think Kendrick needs to drop anymore tracks or let what he's already released speak for itself?

While the response was clever, Kendrick quieted the buzz and enthusiasm with his diabolical reply, \"Meet the Grahams,\" which came minutes later.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper pummeled Drake on a number of fronts, but the most serious allegation was over the Canadian rapper's red flag-raising relationships with younger women.\n\n\"Say Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\" Kendrick raps on \"Not Like Us,\" a reference to the statistic that sex offenders, especially pedophiles, are more likely to be killed in prison than other inmates.\n\n\"Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles,\" Kendrick continues, riffing on the name of Drake's 2021 album. \"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minor.\"\n\nDrake hit back on Sunday night pointing out the lack of proof behind Kendrick's smears, claiming that if he was a child molester, he would've been behind bars already.\n\n\"I feel disgusted, I'm too respected / If I was fucking young girls I would've been arrested / I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested,\" Drake raps.\n\nHe tried to double down on the denial later in the song by making a pass at Kendrick's fiancee, Whitney Alford, but accidentally fanned the flames of Kendrick's allegations by name-dropping a certain Stranger Things actress.\n\n\"Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager,\" he adds later, name dropping the actress whom he befriended when she was a minor. Though Kendrick never mentioned or alluded to her in his disses, Drake's friendship with the actress raised alarms in 2018, when Brown said he was \"a great friend and a great role model\" who gave her advice about boys. She was 14 years old at the time.\n\nThe internet lit up over what many fans perceived as Drake's self-own, with memes flying across social media alluding to the fact that he may have exposed himself by dropping names Kendrick never mentioned.\n\nAgain, there's no proof to support any of the allegations made by either rapper. But in the arena of public opinion, the battle seems to have an emerging winner.\n\nSince the nukes are falling faster and faster between the two rappers, it's only a matter of time until Drake will drop a follow-up the internet can accept as a worthy clapback -- or whether Kendrick will solidify his position with a sonic volley that cements his offensive.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friendly fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Lover_Boy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Certified Lover Boy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ostinato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chord (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name-dropping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Name-dropping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_37/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715015867/GettyImages-1448234929_1_tdtum6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541231", "eventUri": "eng-9541231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

As I waited for the battle bus to pick me up, I could hear one of my teammates loudly playing Canadian actor-turned-rapper Aubrey \"Drake\" Graham's song, \"The Heart Part 6,\" the latest in a series of back-and-forth diss tracks with Pulitzer Prize-winning, Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the two have engaged in a tense rap battle in which they've lobbed insults at each other's families, their street cred, and their star power, with Kendrick sharing a series of songs that many believed \"flattened\" Drake over the weekend. The last shot fired in that salvo, \"Not Like Us,\" released early Sunday and accused the 37-year-old both of hiding an 11-year-old daughter and also engaging in pedophilia. Not long after the release of \"Not Like Us,\" Drake responded with \"The Heart Part 6,\" demanding Kendrick show proof to support his accusations, and suggesting that Drake and his crew had planted these rumors on purpose.\n\n\"I think Drake made a good point,\" a different player in our quad opined as \"The Heart Part 6\" played over someone's headset. \"Kendrick has to prove these rumors are true now.\"\n\n\"Well, no not really,\" I replied. \"This isn't a court case, it's a rap beef.\"\n\nAll three players loudly disagreed with me, insisting that Kendrick's only chance of \"winning\" this battle was by showing proof that Drake had an illegitimate daughter and/or had relations with underage women. They continued discussing the beef, the songs that have come out of this beef, and how each rapper could \"win\" throughout the entire match, and all I could think about was how this beef is fodder for the modern internet and the subcultures it courts.\n\nPart of the reason Kendrick and Drake's beef is so perfectly tailored to today's internet culture is because of how memeworthy it is. The term \"meme\" was first coined by biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene -- Dawkins suggested memes were an idea, a behavior, or a style, mimicked from person-to-person, that could carry and transmit symbolic meaning, as well. Modern internet memes don't just imply a deep layer of knowledge on a topic, but they also denote a person's allegiances, their \"sides.\" Memes are so partisan in today's internet culture that they were used to help elect President Donald Trump in 2016, and again to spur on the January 6, 2021 Capitol Riots, as detailed extensively in the 2022 book, Meme Wars.\n\nWith the Kendrick and Drake beef, someone's allegiances can be made crystal-clear with a singular photo. Simply posting a picture of Drake's 2010 Sprite commercial (in which the rapper sips a Sprite and is summarily split into many pieces like a deconstructed robot) implies that Kendrick tore Drake apart. On the other hand, sharing a picture of Kendrick standing next to another rapper tells people you loudly stump for Drake, as Kendrick's 5'5\" height is the topic of much ridicule in the community.\n\nGamers have also posted their favorite memes, referencing a diverse and eclectic range of games from Fallout to Smash Bros. Some, clearly not plugged into rap music and its relevant beefs, asked the community to help explain the background of this all in Final Fantasy terms, and several people obliged.\n\nOf course, the anime community has latched onto the beef, as Drake's and Kendrick's hatred for one another feels ripped from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Twitch streamer and cosplayer Kayla got back into her Dio cosplay to lip sync several lines from Kendrick's \"euphoria\" track, a testament to the character's legacy as a hater.\n\nEven the subjects of the battle are leaning into memes. Kendrick's \"Not Like Us\" album art features a Google Maps picture of Drake's Toronto mansion, with several red and black icons emblazoned on the mansion. Those markers resemble the ones found on maps that delineate where registered sex offenders live. It's a stark, shareable image that has layers of symbolism, and the internet latched onto it, adding fictional names to his mansion on Google Maps like \"Kendrick's House\" and renaming other nearby houses things like \"CertifiedKidLover\" or \"Child MOE-lester,\" as reported by Gizmodo.\n\nInterestingly, Drake seems to be losing this battle on his home turf. The rapper has notoriously courted the most perpetually online fans, even streaming on Kick, the rival Twitch platform backed by Tyler Faraz Niknam, Bijan Tehrani, and Ed Craven (the latter two of which own Stake, a gambling website that has been closely associated with Kick streamers). Two of the biggest, most historically problematic Kick streamers recently came to Drake's defense on social media, with Adin Ross (who was banned from Twitch in 2023 after streaming pornography) and xQc (who signed a $100 million deal with Kick in 2023), posting in support of the Canadian rapper.\n\nBut despite some of gaming's biggest personalities stumping for Drake, Kendrick seems to be winning this culture war. Kendrick's masterful raps resulted in his diss track getting played in Bushwick clubs and Rick Ross' Vegas pool party, and his seemingly preternatural ability to predict Drake's angles have the internet flabbergasted. Producer Metro Boomin dropping a \"BBL Drake\" beat, which he shared on SoundCloud and encouraged unsigned artists to rap over, promising a free beat to his favorite, just dumps even more ridicule in Drake's lap.\n\nDrake even tried to entice his gaming community fans, posting a God of War III clip on Instagram as a reaction to one of Kendrick's earlier disses. The clip included the quote, \"The hands of Death could not defeat me, the sisters of Fate could not hold me, and you will not live to see the end of this day!\" Later, he clapped back at Metro Boomin, posting a clip from Uncharted in which Nathan Drake laments his ability to \"attract the scum of the earth.\" Guess he's a Sony guy.\n\nBut even with Drake trying to wade into gaming territory, Kendrick's supporters seemed determined to one-up him, posting a scene from the Thor/Kratos fight in God of War Ragnarok whereby Thor restarts Kratos' heart just as it seems like he's about to die.\n\n\"With this Kendrick beef, fans don't want to see Drake post memes on IG or Twitter. The only way to respond to this level of verbal assassination is by getting in the booth,\" The Verge's Ash Parrish told me via Twitter DM. \"And though he has, Drake has lost the rap battle on his home turf of the internet by getting memed relentlessly, as tons of rappers and content creators *the world over* are posting their own Drake disses using producer Metro Boomin's 'BBL Drake' beat.\"\n\nAftermath's Gita Jackson, who wrote a Tumblr post summarizing the beef that has over 10,000 notes at the time of publication, said that the Kendrick/Drake battle transcends the music industry precisely because of the way it leans into internet culture.\n\nIt's not surprising to me that people really like this beef on the internet, and especially in fandom spaces, because in fandom if you are not actively talking about the thing you're a fan of, you're fighting with other fans. Beef is a huge part of being in a fandom, and beef that can be collated or annotated with stuff, that's' even better for fandom, so text-based mediums for the most part.\n\nAnd here, there's so many layers to how much Kendrick hates Drake and the different kinds of ways Kendrick hates Drake, that you could write 10,000 words about this and still not be done with all the details...this has been simmering since the 'Control' verse in 2012. It's been going on for over ten years, that these two men have been both so powerful in the rap industry and hated each other so powerfully.\n\nI think that there's something about that even for people who are not into hip-hop -- especially because it uses the medium of the internet to further all discussion. A lot of the time rap disses don't end up being released officially because they're using samples that aren't cleared and they're written and recorded very quickly. Here they all get dropped via the different ways people are on the internet -- they get dropped on Twitter, one of them was an Instagram reel, Drake is himself very, very active on Instagram, and is currently reacting to everything in his stories.\n\nJackson then echoed what Parrish and others have said about Drake's terminally online presence: \"Drake's career is steeped in the internet itself. That's also the venue he uses to victimize these young girls that he DMs on Instagram...[this beef] is for and from the internet, at least on Drake's side, and it's being perpetuated by the internet. It appeals to the very online among us, because it allows us to stake our claim like we would in a 'ship war. We defend Kendrick because we're against people who victimize young women and fucking culture vultures, or we like Drake, we're on Drake's side because we're on his side of the fandom.\"\n\nThen there's this \"burden of proof\" issue, with some seeming to believe that Kendrick can only \"win\" this beef if he proves there's truth to his allegations against Drake. It smacks of something currently going on in the gaming industry writ large, highlighted in a recent event in which Nick Calandra from Second Wind was fed false information from a potential source in an attempt to discredit an investigation he was working on.\n\nDrake's lines in \"The Heart Part 6\" demand that Kendrick produce paperwork confirming his allegations, and it's the perfect fodder for an internet trained on dis- and misinformation, for a generation of people who fundamentally dislike and distrust mainstream media. Drake is trying to create his own reality and demand that Kendrick play by his rules, which feels very similar to what it's like getting into any sort of argument on the internet these days. Post proof of your harassment, post proof that there's not a cabal of people injecting wokeness into video games, or you lose, liberals.\n\nEven as I wrote this piece, the Drake/Kendrick beef seemed to rapidly approach its own heat death, as the de-facto leader of terminally online men and owner of X/Twitter, Elon Musk, weighed in. \"Everyone's talking about this battle!\" he replied to a post from Drake-aligned DJ Akademiks. Later, he sent a crying laughing emoji reply to another post discussing the beef. It's only a matter of time before he suggests the two duke it out in an X space -- oh wait, the Elon Musk/AOC parody account already did that.", "source": {"uri": "kotaku.com", "dataType": "news",

Drake-Kendrick Lamar feud", "body": "The Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef is quickly becoming the rap feud of the decade, and Toronto is catching a mix of shoutouts and strays as the city's culture is dragged into the heated drama.\n\nSeveral music publications have already broken down the long-simmering beef between the two hip-hop heavyweights, and we are not going to even attempt to do that here today.\n\nInstead, here is a brief summary of every key Toronto-related mention since the feud's major escalation last week and the rapid onslaught of diss tracks that followed.\n\nPerhaps the biggest Toronto mention came last Tuesday when Kendrick Lamar released diss track \"Euphoria,\" which criticized Drake and Toronto hip-hop culture, name-dropping late-night Chinatown restaurant New Ho King in the process.\n\nThe track, itself a response to a mid-April Drake diss track, resulted in the restaurant being showered in five-star reviews as its name trended on multiple social media platforms.\n\nNew Ho King was even part of Drake's return-fire diss track, which will be touched on more in a moment.\n\nToronto slang was another target in Lamar's \"Euphoria,\" which featured the rapper delivering hyper-local phrases like \"tell me you're cheesin', fam\" and \"crodie\" in an exaggerated caricature of the regional dialect.\n\nDrake attempted to take ownership of the New Ho King mention, releasing a return diss track \"Family Matters\" on Friday night with an accompanying video featuring scenes shot in the Chinese restaurant and on the Gardiner Expressway.\n\nDrake went after fellow southern Ontario artist The Weeknd, a public salvo in what had been a vaguely referenced feud that has escalated since the latter's appearance on a track with Future and Metro Boomin where he referenced his decision to opt out of signing with Drake's record label OVO.\n\nDrake refers to The Weeknd by his real name in \"Family Matters,\" saying, \"knew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade, *** said, 'Uh, uh' almost started reachin' for my waist,\" before going on to attack the artist's falsetto singing style.\n\nBut Lamar wasn't finished with Drizzy, wasting zero time releasing another diss track directed at the Toronto rapper titled \"Not Like Us.\" The cover art for the track features a satellite view of Drake's Bridle Path mansion covered in (U.S) sex offender registry map pins.\n\nEven people long removed from Toronto are catching strays, like a reference to former Raptors star Demar DeRozan in \"Not Like Us,\" where Lamar says, \"Deebo, any rap ****, he a free throw.\"\n\nIf it wasn't already evident that this feud has escalated to a level of notoriety well outside of hip-hop circles, hearing Dua Lipa pronounce Toronto's second \"T\" in a Saturday Night Live sketch was a painful addition to what was already a pretty rough night for the city.\n\nSketch comedy parodies like SNL are just one sign of a story reaching that critical mass where even your 72-year-old suburban dad is aware of an ongoing rap feud.\n\nSatirical '\"news\" site The Onion's spoof coverage of the Drake-Kendrick beef included a hilarious apology scenario where the two artists come together to work out their differences at a Toronto Tim Hortons location.", "source": {"uri": "blogto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "blogTO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On the other side of the ring, Drake, born October 24, 1986, is a vengeance and candlewax for breakfast Scorpio sun with an 'everything hurts and I need a nipple and a nap' Cancer moon.\n\nThe brilliant astrologer Neptunicpoetry sagely suremises the meet your match energy of Scorpio vs, Gemini, \"Scorpio is a psychopath, Gemini is a sociopath...The only sign that can properly trigger a Scropio is a Gemini.\"\n\nGemini would rather be dead than bored and Scorpio lives to make their enemies regret being born (see Drake allegedly pouring hot sauce in a used condom to prevent a woman from stealing his skeet ) so you really have a banner set of adversaries in these two.\n\nIn addition, neither sign hesitates when it comes to a low blow.\n\nWhat gives Gemini the upper hand in this dynamic is emotional divestment. Gemini is a mutable air sign ruled by Mercury, the silver-tongued trickster god of messaging.\n\nGemini enjoys starting and sustaining drama because they are not easily wounded by anyone else's trash talk. Not prone to take it personally, Lamar is here for the laughs and to cash in on word play and absurdity.\n\nScorpio on the other hand HOLDS on to hate and does NOT play, war means war and every insult deserves a retaliation. Scorpio is brooding emo folks, they lash out when they're cut deep and all it takes is a paper cut to provoke them.\n\nThe latest escalation of hostility between the two began on March 22 with the release of \"Like That\" from Future, Metro Boomin, and Lamar who seems to subtlety shade Drake in his verses.\n\nDrizzy responded with \"Push Ups,\" and because Scorpios have approximately no chill, he doubled down less than a week later with \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" where he used the A.I.-generated voice of Tupac to insult Lamar.\n\nLeave it to a Scorpio to raise the dead for retribution.\n\nNot for nothing, Lamar waited until Mars moved into its home fires of Aries on Tuesday, April 30th, (Tuesday being the day of the week ruled by the god of war), to release \"Euphoria,\" where he calls out Drake's negligent parenting and alleged plastic surgery.\n\nOn May 3, Lamar dropped \"6:16 in LA,\" rapping that Drake has been betrayed by a member of his own inner circle, literal kryptonite to a Scorpio.\n\nDrizzy retaliated with \"Family Matters,\" where he questions the paternity of Lamar's child and accuses him of physically abusing his fiance, Whitney Alford.\n\nHours later, Lamar released \"Meet the Grahams,\" accusing Drake of secretly fathering a daughter. (For the uninitiated, Drake concealed the birth of his firstborn son and gave him the name of a demigod, so hiding a daughter is in no way beyond the realm of possibility.)\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Lamar released \"Not Like Us,\" where his lyrics intimate that Drake is a pedophile\n\nThe last word (as of right now) belongs to Drake who released \"The Heart Part 6\" on May 5, and with it the lyrical equivalent of nuh-uh.\n\nIt seems the proverbial ball of beef is now in Kendrick's court and with Mercury and Mars aflame together in Aries for another week, I forsee that the lyrical burns will keep on coming.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type":

According to multiple outlets the footage is from an old show in 2010 that took place in Denver Colorado.\n\nDuring the old performance at the Ogden Theater, the Canadian rapper invites a girl on stage, dances with her, seemingly kisses her neck, and compliments her. After reaching his hands across her chest from behind, he then picks up the microphone and acknowledges that he is getting \"carried away.\" When asked about her age, the girl responds that she is 17. Drake responds by saying, \"I can't go to jail yet, man!\"\n\nRELATED: Gillie Da King, Rick Ross, Azealia Banks And More React To Kendrick Lamar's Back-To-Back Drake Diss Tracks\n\nHe then goes on to asks: \"Why do you look like that? You thick [curvaceous]. Look at all this.\" He continues: \"I don't know if I should feel guilty or not, but I had fun. I like the way your breasts feel against my chest.\" He then kisses her on the cheeks and forehead.\n\nWack 100 also shared the footage to his Instagram and compared the situation to R&B singer, R. Kelly who is currently in jail facing federal and state charges related to sexual abuse, child pornography, and other criminal activities. \"Here's the video in question Drake was in concert in Colorado. Girl stated she was 17 Drake at the time was 23 this was 2010. Colorado law is 17 legally he's not in violation of the STATE law . But FEDERAL law states 18 across the board - This is what got #RKelly indicted . No Sex happened but lewd conduct is in question.

Is that, n****s is so hot that like, whatever n****s say about the battle, n****s care what we say about the battle. I'm going to say what I want to say about the battle! ... Y'all n****s be tagging me like I'm in the battle.\"\n\nMase said that a rap battle is \"like a fight,\" and as such, one opponent could be winning one round and losing the next.\n\n\"We didn't put money up at the beginning of the battle,\" Cam added. \"So who do you think won?\" Mase asked. \"Right now, man, I'm gonna be honest... Kendrick,\" said Cam. \"I don't like what Drake dropped last night, because... It wasn't bad, but I don't like the way it ended. He seemed like he [was] like, 'This the last one I'm doing.' You can't end it when you just want to end it. He like, 'Yo man, I'm tired of doing this.'\"\n\nKendrick and Drake's beef kicked into overtime last week when the former hit the latter with the back-to-back punch of \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA\" just days apart. Following the release of \"Euphoria,\" Cam and Mase suggested that Drake was currently \"winning\" the feud. But the rapid escalation in the days that followed has clearly changed their tune. Drake responded to \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA\" the same day as the latter of the two, which was followed by another diss from Kendrick, \"Meet the Grahams,\" less than an hour later. The following day, Kendrick dropped the explosive \"Not Like Us,\" and Drake came back again with \"The Heart Part 6\" on Sunday, May 5.\n\n\"You shouldn't have ended it like that,\" said Cam of \"The Heart Part 6,\" which has an implication of finality to it from Drake. \"That's just my opinion right now, not saying Drake ain't my bro or nothing, but I don't like the way he ended it if that's the end for him. So I'm going to go with Kendrick right now.\"\n\nMase agreed with Cam's take on the latest developments of the battle, praising \"Not Like Us\" in particular. \"I'm going with Kendrick as well,\" he said. \"It seemed like, whatever he started out doing, he picked up the speed, and really did what he was supposed to do. I thought the record that he did, the last one that he did, was the one I thought he should have done a little bit earlier.\"\n\n\"'Not Like Us,' that was crazy... When I heard that I was like, 'Oh yeah, it's going to be tough,'\" Mase said. \"That was the one I was expecting.\"\n\nCam said that when \"Family Matters\" dropped, he heard it in the club \"like ten times back to back,\" while \"Meet the Grahams\" isn't really club material. \"When Kendrick came with an upbeat one, they played that in the club like ten times in a row,\" Cam said. \"The one Drake just dropped, it was kind of slow. It seemed like he don't want to do it no more, pause, and I just don't like the way it ended. Like you said Murder, we'll see, to be continued. But it don't seem like Drake want to battle no more.\"\n\nAfter the arrival of \"Euphoria,\" Cam and Mase chimed in on the beef during an episode of It Is What It Is last week. \"Drake is definitely winning from a MC standpoint,\" Mase said before things got serious on Friday, May 3 onwards. \"It took a while for us to get the record from Kendrick, and when you wait a while it's gotta be out of this world. I think if Kendrick dropped this record right after [Drake dropped \"Push Ups\"], it would have been crazy. If it was immediate then it would have been crazy but we waited a while to get this.\"\n\nCam agreed and said Drake was \"winning\" at the time, and that Kendrick's \"Euphoria\" didn't \"move\" him.

As Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef continues to take over the world folks have started revealing some information after K-Dot accused Drizzy of being a \"pedophile.\"\n\nX users noticed an old interview of Dennis Graham speaking with TMZ in 2018 where he spoke about the #MeToo movement and said that it wouldn't be necessary if women avoided putting themselves in potential dangerous situations. After the old interview began to rounds on X (formerly known as Twitter) one user on the app called out the rapper's father. \"Nah cuz he tried to forcefully finger one of my friends Delilah's.

Mr. Dennis need to be strapped up in a booster chair.\"\n\nRELATED: Footage Resurfaces Of Drake Being On Stage With 17-Year-Old In 2010\n\nAfter that tweet went viral, more shockingly the female rapper Baby Tate also alleged to having an inappropriate encounter with Dennis Graham. \"He grabbed my a** at a party and tried to gaslight me when I tweeted about it and it hit the blogs.\"\n\nDennis Graham, who is a musician himself, was absent for much of Drake's childhood. Drake has spoken openly about the impact of his father's absence on his upbringing and his music. In his song \"Look What You've Done,\" Drake raps about his father's absence and the impact it had on him growing up. He sings, \"And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way / Over some minor charges and child support / That just wasn't paid, damn.\"\n\nDespite the rocky relationship, Drake and his father have tried to mend their relationship over the years. In interviews, Drake has spoken about how he has forgiven his father and the importance of family. In a 2017 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Drake said, \"I'm just so proud of the fact that regardless of what he went through, he's able to keep it together and be a father to me and a friend to me.\"\n\nRELATED: Gillie Da King, Rick Ross, Azealia Banks And More React To Kendrick Lamar's Back-To-Back Drake Diss Tracks\n\nIn recent years, Drake and his father have been seen spending time together publicly, attending events and supporting each other's endeavors.

After he dropped \"The Heart Part 6\" last night, he may have seen it as a victory lap, but fans online appeared to view it as more of a white flag of surrender after Kendrick Lamar spammed Drake with nonstop diss tracks over the course of the weekend.\n\nMetro Boomin, who pretty much started all this in the first place after inviting Kendrick onto his and Future's joint album We Don't Trust You, summed up his feelings with a Chris Paul highlight. Heading over to YouTube, he took a screenshot of the video title that best suited the moment: \"Chris Paul hits a huge three to cut the lead down to 42.\"\n\nFor those who aren't into sports, the analogy likens Drake emptying the clip on \"The Heart Part 6\" to a heroic, but ultimately futile effort in a competition in which his loss is inevitable. In basketball, being down 42 points isn't quite an insurmountable lead, especially in the first half of a game, but it's also basically a war of attrition in which there have historically been very few winners. Digging out of such hole requires not only impressive levels of skill and endurance but also borderline miraculous luck -- i.e. \"an act of God.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Drake, it doesn't look like any deities are coming to his rescue anytime soon.

Portraying a local TV morning show culture critic named Wanda Weems, Lipa tried -- and arguably failed -- to explain the roots of the dispute using the sort of visual aid one might expect to depict an international conspiracy or the work of a serial killer.\n\nThe dispute between the former collaborators has been brewing since 2013, when Lamar's verse in Big Sean's song \"Control\" appeared to target Drake, among other members of the music community. Things rapidly escalated last month, when the pair began to trade competing tracks listing grievances against the other, as well as alleging misconduct and other crimes.\n\nSee how easy that was? Then again, I'm not a staffer at Good Morning Greenville, the fictional local broadcast morning show that SNL sent up in its most recent episode. In the sketch, Mikey Day and Heidi Gardner provide disturbingly accurate renditions of the kind of jocular yet frightening folks who host these shows. Citing (sic throughout) \"Kanye, Two Pack, Shoop Dog, As Soon as Possible Rocky\" as rappers who've been mixed into the beef \"like they were chopped onions and cayenne pepper,\" Day's host asks, \"Why can't I be Team Rap in general?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gardner's character asks \"And where does Wayne Brady stand? Has he responded?\"\n\nAfter Derek the weatherman (Devon Walker) declines to participate, a southern-accented Dua Lipa steps in. After admitting that she's qualified to evaluate the situation as she's an elementary school piano teacher, Lipa steps in front of a board strewn with photos, objects, and cross-pinned stretches of yarn.\n\nWhat follows is an explanation that's just accurate enough to be dangerous, punctuated by cancel-worthy questions from the hosts. The whole thing ends with a satirically racist puppet show and a threatened use of a racial slur, all of which I'd be laughing at if I hadn't heard many of the humorously intended remarks made by the hosts expressed unironically in recent days by actual real people who exist in the world. That truth is probably what makes it a pretty solid sketch, but it's also what makes it slightly painful to watch.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Start_Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Don't Start Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dua Lipa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Gardner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heidi Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikey_Day", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikey Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sean", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Sean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenville,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenville, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Walker_(comedian)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devon Walker (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayenne_pepper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cayenne pepper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6637aef7068e2874a84622f3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-05%20at%2012.04.39%E2%80%AFPM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541231", "eventUri": "eng-9541231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 90, "relevance": 1}

According to The State, fans who paid to see Davidson were turned away at the door after venue manager Nicole Moore announced the show would be postponed.\n\nAccording to the article, the postponement was due to the club's lack of bags to secure attendees' phones.

Hip-hop beefs have spiraled out of control before, but this feud seems deeply personal, far removed from performative play-fighting.\n\nLamar's most recent track, \"Not Like Us,\" saw Lamar double down on his allegations, labeling Drake a \"certified pedophile.\" Drake's response, \"The Heart Part 6,\" sees the Canadian rapper on the defensive, repeatedly denying Lamar's claims.\n\nDrake, one of the world's best-selling music artists, boasting more than 81 million monthly listeners on Spotify, has been reduced to singing lyrics such as, \"I never been with no one underage.\"\n\nMany internet commentators compared Drake's song to a scene from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, in which a similar scenario was played for laughs.\n\nLamar has yet to respond to \"The Heart Part 6,\" but the internet is expecting him to release another scorcher any day now, with Lamar hinting on his most recent track, \"Not Like Us,\" that he has many more on the horizon, rapping:\n\n\"How many stocks do I really have in stock? / One, two, three, four, five, plus five.\"\n\nTimelines of the beef begin with the 2023 collaboration between Drake and J.

Hip-hop beefs have spiraled out of control before, but this feud seems deeply personal, far removed from performative play-fighting.\n\nLamar's most recent track, \"Not Like Us,\" saw Lamar double down on his allegations, labeling Drake a \"certified pedophile.\" Drake's response, \"The Heart Part 6,\" sees the Canadian rapper on the defensive, repeatedly denying Lamar's claims.\n\nDrake, one of the world's best-selling music artists, boasting more than 81 million monthly listeners on Spotify, has been reduced to singing lyrics such as, \"I never been with no one underage.\"\n\nMany internet commentators compared Drake's song to a scene from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, in which a similar scenario was played for laughs.\n\nLamar has yet to respond to \"The Heart Part 6,\" but the internet is expecting him to release another scorcher any day now, with Lamar hinting on his most recent track, \"Not Like Us,\" that he has many more on the horizon, rapping:\n\n\"How many stocks do I really have in stock? / One, two, three, four, five, plus five.\"\n\nTimelines of the beef begin with the 2023 collaboration between Drake and J.

In one corner: a powerful, domineering, perhaps overconfident presence that defined an era. On the other: a bellicose great power in its own right, leery of the former's encroachment into their lands.\n\nAnd so the Athenian Empire and Sparta went to war. It emerged from a structural, slow-simmering friction between the two nations that students of geopolitics know as the Thucydides Trap, named after the ancient Greek historian who wrote that \"it was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.\"\n\nNow, in a battle with much lower stakes but much higher production values, hip-hop finds itself in a new Peloponnesian War.\n\nA low-boil disdain between two of hip-hop's megastars - Toronto's Aubrey Drake Graham and Los Angeles lyricist Kendrick Lamar - has spilled over into explicit public view. In brief: After each rapper repeatedly declined to interpret years of glancing boasts, subliminal digs and even unintended slights in good faith, Lamar's line dismissing the idea that rap has a big three (\"it's just big me\") on Like That sparked the dry forest tinder in March. Then Drake released two tracks over six days in April - Push Ups and Taylor Made Freestyle - that for the first time took aim directly at Lamar. In turn, Lamar didn't take swipes about his shoe size and relatively limited commercial success lying down, responding with Euphoria, which explosively castigated the Canadian rapper for, among other things, being a culture vulture.\n\nThen, late Friday night, things escalated dramatically. Drake released Family Matters, assailing Lamar's social-activist credibility. Just a half-hour later, Lamar dropped Meet the Grahams, the most cruelly personal rap put to wax since Tupac Shakur laid waste to Notorious B.I.G. with Hit 'Em Up. A day later, he doubled down with Not Like Us, going so far as to accuse Drake's camp of pedophilia.\n\nThe rappers' accusations have been largely unverifiable, but they have been cutthroat, ranging from drug use, partner infidelity, mockery about being molested and domestic abuse. In his latest response, The Heart (Part 6), Drake claimed Lamar's child was fathered by his label's former president; in Meet the Grahams, an imagined conversation with Drake's dad, Lamar rapped, \"You raised a horrible ... person\" who \"should die.\" Former collaborators have taken sides, drawing lines in the sand and issuing insults that have dredged social-media dirty laundry to the booth.\n\nIn short, this beef is no longer about who's at the top of the rap game. It's about who can race to the bottom fastest.\n\nRap fans have thrilled to each development, with bar-by-bar analysis and furious debates over the victor. But that would make all this something of a game. Instead, what could have been seen as yet more performance and posturing - in a genre that has an increasingly loose relationship with its founding value of authenticity - has tipped over into something altogether sadistic. As in our democracy at large, this mud-slinging will change no supporter's minds about their flagbearer's rivals, but it will leave everyone wounded, perhaps even mortally. And the biggest loser may be the decade-plus of peace, mutual flourishing and innovation that has been detonated.\n\nHip hop is a cultural monolith now, an institution that has accrued influence by its major players agreeing to work toward a kind of collective commercial success. Drake in many ways has been the period's defining voice and primary beneficiary, pushing sonic boundaries in ways that are only possible in peacetime. That doesn't mean that personal tensions wouldn't flare into lyrical haymakers; sparring is in rap's very DNA. But red lines were largely restored by bottom lines. Collegiality, broadly speaking, was king, and the world got better music for it.\n\nThat era feels like it's over now - and all because of a conflict that says less about the state of hip hop and more about the players involved.\n\nWhile the most iconic rap beefs were personal, they were often laden with meaning, too - forks in the road for the soul of hip hop. Shakur and Biggie's personal falling-out became wrapped up in broader regional battles; their tragic killings led to an emotional realignment of hip hop's modus operandi. For Jay Z and Nas, a record-studio slight turned into an ugly war of words that sucked up so much oxygen in New York, the cradle of the culture, that it led to a referendum on the city's hegemony.\n\nThe Drake-Kendrick conflict does reach for such heights - particularly as the latter has worked to frame the ballot question around morality, and who gets to champion Black culture - but it's hard to argue that this beef is about right or wrong any more, if it was ever about that. Accusations of terrible and even criminal acts are now being thrown out not in the name of justice or accountability, but to score points.\n\nAnd so Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize-winner whose last album was a treatise on doing therapy, and Drake, one of the most innovative and top-selling pop musicians of this generation, have each brought ruin to their carefully curated selves. No matter where this beef leads, these accusations will hang in the air like napalm. And for what?\n\nThe Thucydides Trap is incredibly hard to avert - just ask those involved in the war games between Beijing and Washington. The last time a deeply personal feud flared between two rap megastars, it required nearly divine intervention: \"Mom put in a call and said, 'That went too far,'\" Jay Z said in 2001.\n\nSo now what? De-escalation doesn't look to be happening any time soon. It feels as if we're edging closer to a smouldering crater.\n\nIn 404 BC, Sparta won the Peloponnesian War, destabilizing the region, as war became the norm. Just a few decades later, Macedonia claimed supremacy. And then in 272 BC, a king named Pyrrhus of Epirus tried to take Sparta but was killed in the effort. He had previously suffered such unacceptable losses in initial success in a separate conflict against Rome that it gave rise to its own term in our lexicon: pyrrhic.\n\nThere's a lesson in there, a world away and two millennia later.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

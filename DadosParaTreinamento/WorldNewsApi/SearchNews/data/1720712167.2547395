Shared by an Instagram handle @60secdocs, the video shows researcher Dr Perran Ross putting his hand inside a glass box filled with mosquitoes. The clip shows several mosquitoes biting Dr Ross. Soon after he takes his arm out, one can see countless little red bumps. \u201cMost people wonder why would anyone volunteer to stick their arm in a cage of mosquitoes. But they\u2019re such beautiful creatures. I am Dr Ross. I am from Melbourne and I let mosquitoes sting me for research,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cIn addition to conducting research on mosquito traits and their lifespans, the job of Mosquito-Man, (aka Dr. Perran Ross) @mosquito_whisperer as an experimental biologist includes sticking his arm inside mosquito cages and letting them bite for ten seconds. His biggest haul was 15,000 mosquito bites,\u201d the caption on the video read.

He got a bit emotional at first when discussing them. I\u2019d be interested in hearing more about his reasoning.\u201d \u201cMost people are afraid of malaria. Malaria is afraid of him,\u201d a third user reacted.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/researcher-feeds-his-blood-to-mosquitoes-netizens-say-malaria-is-afraid-of-him-9381633/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Video-4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:43:35", "author": "Trends Desk", "authors": ["Trends Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.198}

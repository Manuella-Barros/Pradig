Get ahead with us - it's free.\n\nEntitlements outlook gets an extension\n\nWASHINGTON -- The go-broke dates for Medicare and Social Security have been pushed back as an improving economy has contributed to changed projected depletion dates, according to the annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report Monday.\n\nStill, officials warn that policy changes are needed lest the programs become unable to pay full benefits to retiring Americans.\n\nMedicare's go-broke date for its hospital insurance trust fund was pushed back five years to 2036 in the latest report, thanks in part to higher payroll tax income and lower-than-projected expenses from last year. Medicare is the federal government's health insurance program that covers people age 65 and older and those with severe disabilities or illnesses. It covered more than 66 million people last year, with most being 65 and older.\n\nOnce the fund's reserves become depleted, Medicare would be able to cover only 89 percent of costs for patients' hospital visits, hospice care and nursing home stays or home health care that follow hospital visits.\n\nMeanwhile, Social Security's trust funds -- which cover old age and disability recipients -- will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035, instead of last year's estimate of 2034. Social Security would only be able to pay 83 percent of benefits.\n\nUS overfishing list at all-time low\n\nPORTLAND, Maine -- The number of fish on the government's overfishing list sunk to a new low last year in a sign of healthy U.S. fisheries, federal officials said.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released an updated analysis of American fisheries late last week via its annual \"Status of the Stocks\" report, which provides an assessment of the populations of the seafood species fishermen catch and customers buy. The report states that 94% of fish stocks are not subject to overfishing, which is slightly better than a year ago.\n\nThe U.S. was able to remove several important fish stocks from the overfishing list, NOAA said in a statement. They include the Gulf of Maine and Cape Hatteras stock of Atlantic mackerel and the Gulf of Mexico stock of cubera snapper.\n\nNOAA's report arrives as international governments and non-governmental organizations have tried to crack down on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing around the worldwide ocean. In Europe, the European Commission has worked to prioritze detering unsustainable fishing practices.\n\nThe removal of species from the overfishing list shows the U.S. is making progress, said Rick Spinrad, NOAA's administrator.\n\nSchultz: Starbucks must focus on coffee\n\nFormer Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says the company's leaders should spend more time in stores and focus on coffee drinks as they work to turn around flagging sales.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post published over the weekend, Schultz said many people had reached out to him after Starbucks reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings last week.\n\nThe Seattle coffee giant said revenue dropped 2% in the January-March period as store traffic slowed around the world. It was the first time since 2020 that the company saw a drop in quarterly revenue. Starbucks also lowered its sales and earnings guidance for its full fiscal year.\n\nSchultz, who bought Starbucks in 1987, is credited with growing the company into the global behemoth it has become with nearly 39,000 stores worldwide. He has been the chairman emeritus of the company since last fall, when he stepped down from Starbucks' board.\n\nSchultz remains Starbucks' largest individual shareholder, holding shares that were valued at $1.5 billion at the end of last year.\n\nIn his post, Schultz said senior leaders - including board members - need to spend more time talking to baristas in the company's stores.\n\nRedfin to pay $9.5M settlement\n\nRedfin has agreed to pay $9.25 million to settle federal lawsuits that claim U.S. homeowners were saddled with artificially inflated broker commissions when they sold their home as a result of longstanding real estate industry practices.\n\nThe online brokerage and real estate services company disclosed the proposed settlement Monday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe settlement, which Redfin agreed to Friday, would resolve pending class action lawsuits filed in federal court in the Western District of Missouri, and also shield the company, its subsidiaries and agents from similar cases around the country, according to the filing.\n\n\"Resolving this litigation now and removing uncertainty is in the best interest of the company, our employees, and our investors,\" the company said in a statement Monday.\n\nSeattle-based Redfin noted that it doesn't expect the settlement, which must be approved by the court, to have a material impact on its future operations, adding it expects to record a $9.25 million pre-tax charge for the quarter ended March 31.\n\nSign up for our business newsletter.

{"id": 231986010, "title": "I went into labor at a Taylor Swift concert \u2014 and danced through the pain: 'Euphoric experience'", "text": "A mum went into labour half way through a Taylor Swift gig but managed to dance through the pain \u2013 and hold off giving birth for days. Jenn Gutierrez, 31, was 38 weeks pregnant when she flew 412 miles from Canberra, Australia, to Melbourne, to see her favorite artist perform. Despite being just two weeks away from her due date Jenn knew nothing would stop her getting to the Era\u2019s Tour with her husband, Michael Sin, 31, a public servant, and her twin sister, Dani, 31. But an hour in, during Taylor\u2019s Reputation set Jenn suddenly started having contractions. The contractions continued for the rest of the gig but Jenn managed to keep dancing and singing through them. They stopped after she got back to the hotel and she managed to fly back home the next morning. She gave birth to her daughter, now two months, a few days later in February 2024. Jenn, a executive assistant, said: \u201cThey started during the Reputation set. \u201cI thought \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere. If this baby comes she coming out now\u2019. \u201cThe contractions got progressively worse. \u201cIn the Midnights set I thought \u2018OMG, I\u2019m going to have this baby right now\u2019.\u201d Jenn and Dani have always been big Taylor Swift fans and couldn\u2019t believe it when they bagged $600 AUD VIP tickets on the third day of ticket releases in November 2024. Jenn said: \u201cWe were doing the maths and we didn\u2019t think I was going to be that pregnant initially. \u201cWe then realised we were cutting it close.\u201d Jenn was cleared to fly six days before the show but had been prepared to do the eight-hour drive if not. She said: \u201cWe were adamant about going. \u201cNo way we were going to miss the show.\u201d Jenn, Michael and Dani and her husband flew out on the morning of the show and got glammed up in cowboy boots and sparkles. Jenn suddenly felt the contractions starting an hour in. She said: \u201cI was so shocked. I was a bit taken back. \u201cMy twins sister was next to me monitoring me. \u201cMy husband was keeping an eye on my heart rate on my Apple watch. \u201cI hope the girls behind me didn\u2019t think I\u2019m not a real Swiftie because I kept sitting down. \u201cIt was a euphoric experience.\u201d By the end of the show Jenn was struggling to stand and walk. She said: \u201cI felt the baby on its way out because she was so low. \u201cImagine standing for three hours with a bowling ball between your legs. \u201cI waddles out of the stadium.\u201d Jenn got an Uber back to her hotel and managed to ease her contractions after she had calmed down. She said: \u201cI sat with my legs up on the bed.\u201d The group flew back the next morning. Jenn said: \u201cI said \u2018 you can come\u2019 as soon as we touched down.\u201d Jenn gave birth a few days later to a \u201chappy\u201d and \u201chealthy\u201d baby girl weighing 7lbs 7oz. She said: \u201cThe first song she listened to was Fearless by Taylor Swift. \u201cShe is an imbedded Swiftie.\u201d", "summary": "\"I thought 'I'm not going anywhere.

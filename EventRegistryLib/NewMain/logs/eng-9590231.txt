Their model shows that perturbations in the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun can generate realistic magnetic patterns, challenging previous beliefs and potentially improving solar activity forecasts. Credit: SciTechDaily.com\n\nSolar phenomena like sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, according to surprising new findings that may help scientists predict space weather.\n\nThe sun's surface dazzles with sunspots and flares, products of a solar magnetic field created by a mechanism known as dynamo action. Traditionally, astrophysicists believed that this magnetic field formed deep within the star. However, a study by MIT suggests that these phenomena might actually be shaped by a much shallower process.\n\nPublished today (May 22) in the journal Nature, the research conducted by teams from MIT, the University of Edinburgh, and other institutions suggests that instabilities within the sun's outermost layers could be responsible for its magnetic field.\n\nBy developing a detailed model of the sun's surface and simulating various disturbances in the plasma flow within the upper 5 to 10 percent of the sun, the researchers discovered that these surface alterations could generate magnetic field patterns that closely resemble those observed by astronomers. Conversely, simulations of the sun's deeper layers yielded less accurate depictions of solar activity.\n\nThe findings suggest that sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, rather than a field that originates deeper in the sun, as scientists had largely assumed.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" says study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mathematics. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nIf the sun's magnetic field does in fact arise from its outermost layers, this might give scientists a better chance at forecasting flares and geomagnetic storms that have the potential to damage satellites and telecommunications systems.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,\" says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. \"But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.\"\n\nThe study's co-authors also include Daniel Lecoanet and Kyle Augustson of Northwestern University, Jeffrey Oishi of Bates College, Benjamin Brown and Keith Julien of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Nicholas Brummell of the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nThe sun is a white-hot ball of plasma that's boiling on its surface. This boiling region is called the \"convection zone,\" where layers and plumes of plasma roil and flow. The convection zone comprises the top one-third of the sun's radius and stretches about 200,000 kilometers below the surface.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explains. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nTo pin down exactly where the sun's magnetic field originates, other scientists have used large three-dimensional simulations to try to solve for the flow of plasma throughout the many layers of the sun's interior. \"Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,\" Burns says.\n\nRather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, Burns and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.\n\nTo explore this idea, the team first used data from the field of \"helioseismology,\" where scientists use observed vibrations on the sun's surface to determine the average structure and flow of plasma beneath the surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns says. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside.\"\n\nFor their new study, the researchers collected models of the sun's structure from helioseismic observations. \"These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other,\" Burns explains. \"Then we ask: Are there perturbations, or tiny changes in the flow of plasma, that we could superimpose on top of this average structure, that might grow to cause the sun's magnetic field?\"\n\nTo look for such patterns, the team utilized the Dedalus Project -- a numerical framework that Burns developed that can simulate many types of fluid flows with high precision. The code has been applied to a wide range of problems, from modeling the dynamics inside individual cells, to ocean and atmospheric circulations.\n\n\"My collaborators have been thinking about the solar magnetism problem for years, and the capabilities of Dedalus have now reached the point where we could address it,\" Burns says.\n\nThe team developed algorithms that they incorporated into Dedalus to find self-reinforcing changes in the sun's average surface flows. The algorithm discovered new patterns that could grow and result in realistic solar activity. In particular, the team found patterns that match the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo in 1612.\n\nSunspots are transient features on the surface of the sun that are thought to be shaped by the sun's magnetic field. These relatively cooler regions appear as dark spots in relation to the rest of the sun's white-hot surface. Astronomers have long observed that sunspots occur in a cyclical pattern, growing and receding every 11 years, and generally gravitating around the equator, rather than near the poles.\n\nIn the team's simulations, they found that certain changes in the flow of plasma, within just the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun's surface layers, were enough to generate magnetic structures in the same regions. In contrast, changes in deeper layers produce less realistic solar fields that are concentrated near the poles, rather than near the equator.\n\nThe team was motivated to take a closer look at flow patterns near the surface as conditions there resembled the unstable plasma flows in entirely different systems: the accretion disks around black holes. Accretion disks are massive disks of gas and stellar dust that rotate in towards a black hole, driven by the \"magnetorotational instability,\" which generates turbulence in the flow and causes it to fall inward.\n\nBurns and his colleagues suspected that a similar phenomenon is at play in the sun, and that the magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers could be the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" he ventures. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\" Burns says that the team is continuing to study if the new surface field patterns can generate individual sunspots and the full 11-year solar cycle.", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_phenomena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar phenomena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vibration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shear stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioseismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helioseismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Santa Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Magnetic-Fields-Sun-Art-Concept.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 941, "textEnd": 947}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

Yet, ever since astronomers began investigating the sun's magnetic fields, the point from which they originate has remained undetermined. Now, an international team of researchers may be closer to solving this 400-year-old mystery that confounded even Galileo Galilei.\n\nThe discovery means that sunspots and flares are likely to be the product of a shallow magnetic field rather than a field that originates deeper within the sun, something that had previously been theorized. The team's findings could help solar scientists better predict solar flares and geomagnetic storms that pose a risk to Earth's satellites, communications systems, and power infrastructure while also providing a strange link between the outer layers of the sun and feeding black holes.\n\nRelated: The stormy sun erupts with its biggest solar flare yet from a massive sunspot -- and it's still crackling (video)\n\nUsing a NASA supercomputer, the team behind this research performed a series of complex calculations that showed the sun's magnetic field is generated around 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) below its surface, the photosphere. This may seem incredibly deep, but the sun has a radius of around 433,000 miles (697,000 km), meaning the magnetic fields are generated in the outer 10% of the sun's superheated plasma.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" team member Keaton Burns, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said in a statement. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe sun generates its magnetic field via a physical process that scientists call the solar dynamo. Previous models of this dynamo have suggested it is kick-started in a roiling and turbulent region of the sun called the convection zone. Here, hot plasma rises away from the core of the sun, where the majority of its energy is generated, carrying heat and energy to the surface of the sun, the photosphere.\n\nAfter the energy is deposited, the plasma cools and falls back through the convection zone, which has a depth of around 124,000 miles (200,000 km) and accounts for around 30% of the sun's volume, past the next \"batch\" of rising heated plasma.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explained. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nOther teams of researchers have previously created three-dimensional simulations of the sun to model the flow of plasma throughout its various layers and to thus determine where its magnetic field originates. The team argues that these simulations failed to pinpoint the true starting point of the solar dynamo because they failed to capture the true picture of just how chaotic and turbulent the sun actually is.\n\nBurns and his team took a different approach. Instead of modeling the flow of plasma throughout all the layers in the interior of the sun, they focused on the stability of plasma at the solar surface. They wanted to determine if changes in this surface region would be enough to start the solar dynamo.\n\nTo begin, Burns and colleagues used a process called \"helioseismology\" that measures trapped soundwaves as they ripple through the sun and cause oscillations called \"starquakes\" at the solar surface to determine the interior of the sun. This allowed them to determine the structure and flow of plasma just beneath the solar surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns said. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside. These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other.\"\n\nThe team turned to the Dedalus Project, a framework developed by Burns that can simulate fluid flows with high precision, to look at this flow of solar plasma and then see if any tiny changes or \"perturbations\" could be introduced to the regular structure that could grow and cause the solar dynamo.\n\nTheir algorithm discovered new patterns in the flow of plasma that can grow and create a picture of real solar activity. These patterns matched the locations of sunspots that astronomers have been seeing since 1612 and the observations of Galileo.\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe Dedalus Project simulations revealed that changes in plasma flows in the top 5% to 10% of the sun were sufficient enough to generate magnetic structures that can account for observed sunspot activity. When they modeled deeper regions of our star as the source of magnetic fields, this led to sunspots congregating at the poles of the sun rather than its equator, which is the opposite of what is actually seen by astronomers.\n\nTaking a closer look at how plasma flowed at the surface of the sun, Burns and colleagues also found a surprising similarity to the immediate environments of black holes.\n\nWhen stars venture too close to black holes, they can be destroyed by massive gravitational forces that squash them horizontally and squeeze them vertically, \"spaghettifying\" them in an occurrence called a tidal disruption event (TDE).\n\nFurthermore, in situations when a star orbits a black hole in a binary system and is either too close, or its outer layers have \"puffed out,\" the gravitational influence of the black hole can strip away stellar material.\n\nIn both the cases of stellar cannibalism and in less extreme situations when black holes are in regions of gas and dust, this superheated plasma has angular momentum (or spin), and that means it can't just fall into the black hole.\n\nInstead, this plasma forms a flattened cloud around the black hole that gradually feeds it and is subject to immense frictional forces due to the gravity of the black hole that heats it, causing it to glow. This 'platter' of plasma is called an accretion disk. Accretion disks are turbulent and feed black holes because of co-called \"magnetorotational instability\" in their flow of plasma. This turbulence is created when magnetized material closer to the edge of an accretion disk moves more slowly than material closer to its center.\n\nBurns and team think that a similar phenomenon is happening in the sun's magnetic field, and it is this magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers that is the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" Burns added. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"\n\nThe team will now continue their investigation by studying surface magnetic field patterns and attempting to determine if they can create individual sunspots in their simulations and to determine how they link to the overall 11-year cycle of the sun.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,\" Geoffrey Vasil, team member and researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said. \"But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_lea@space.com", "name": "Robert Lea", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black hole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scattered disc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar maximum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar Dynamics Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6R4oeNbw6bvd4R4b8s8oDF-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

1612.\n\nSince then, astronomers have attempted to understand where the sun's ever-changing magnetic field comes from.\n\nThe widely held view is that it is generated deep within the star, around

(AP) -- New research indicates the sun's magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month.\n\nThe magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) beneath the sun's surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) below, an international team reported Wednesday.\n\nThe sun's intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections.

Astrophysicists have assumed that the sun's field is generated deep within the star. But an MIT study finds that the sun's activity may be shaped by a much shallower process.\n\nIn a paper appearing in Nature, researchers at MIT, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere find that the sun's magnetic field could arise from instabilities within the sun's outermost layers.\n\nThe team generated a precise model of the sun's surface and found that when they simulated certain perturbations, or changes in the flow of plasma (ionized gas) within the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun, these surface changes were enough to generate realistic magnetic field patterns, with similar characteristics to what astronomers have observed on the sun. In contrast, their simulations in deeper layers produced less realistic solar activity.\n\nThe findings suggest that sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, rather than a field that originates deeper in the sun, as scientists had largely assumed.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" says study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mathematics. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nIf the sun's magnetic field does in fact arise from its outermost layers, this might give scientists a better chance at forecasting flares and geomagnetic storms that have the potential to damage satellites and telecommunications systems.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,\" says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. \"But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.\"\n\nThe study's co-authors also include Daniel Lecoanet and Kyle Augustson of Northwestern University, Jeffrey Oishi of Bates College, Benjamin Brown and Keith Julien of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Nicholas Brummell of the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nFlow zone\n\nThe sun is a white-hot ball of plasma that's boiling on its surface. This boiling region is called the \"convection zone,\" where layers and plumes of plasma roil and flow. The convection zone comprises the top one-third of the sun's radius and stretches about 200,000 kilometers below the surface.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explains. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nTo pin down exactly where the sun's magnetic field originates, other scientists have used large three-dimensional simulations to try to solve for the flow of plasma throughout the many layers of the sun's interior. \"Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,\" Burns says.\n\nRather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, Burns and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.\n\nTo explore this idea, the team first used data from the field of \"helioseismology,\" where scientists use observed vibrations on the sun's surface to determine the average structure and flow of plasma beneath the surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns says. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside.\"\n\nSolar onion\n\nFor their new study, the researchers collected models of the sun's structure from helioseismic observations. \"These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other,\" Burns explains. \"Then we ask: Are there perturbations, or tiny changes in the flow of plasma, that we could superimpose on top of this average structure, that might grow to cause the sun's magnetic field?\"\n\nTo look for such patterns, the team utilized the Dedalus Project -- a numerical framework that Burns developed that can simulate many types of fluid flows with high precision. The code has been applied to a wide range of problems, from modeling the dynamics inside individual cells, to ocean and atmospheric circulations.\n\n\"My collaborators have been thinking about the solar magnetism problem for years, and the capabilities of Dedalus have now reached the point where we could address it,\" Burns says.\n\nThe team developed algorithms that they incorporated into Dedalus to find self-reinforcing changes in the sun's average surface flows. The algorithm discovered new patterns that could grow and result in realistic solar activity. In particular, the team found patterns that match the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo in 1612.\n\nSunspots are transient features on the surface of the sun that are thought to be shaped by the sun's magnetic field. These relatively cooler regions appear as dark spots in relation to the rest of the sun's white-hot surface. Astronomers have long observed that sunspots occur in a cyclical pattern, growing and receding every 11 years, and generally gravitating around the equator, rather than near the poles.\n\nIn the team's simulations, they found that certain changes in the flow of plasma, within just the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun's surface layers, were enough to generate magnetic structures in the same regions. In contrast, changes in deeper layers produce less realistic solar fields that are concentrated near the poles, rather than near the equator.\n\nThe team was motivated to take a closer look at flow patterns near the surface as conditions there resembled the unstable plasma flows in entirely different systems: the accretion disks around black holes. Accretion disks are massive disks of gas and stellar dust that rotate in towards a black hole, driven by the \"magnetorotational instability,\" which generates turbulence in the flow and causes it to fall inward.\n\nBurns and his colleagues suspected that a similar phenomena is at play in the sun, and that the magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers could be the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" he ventures. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\" Burns says that the team is continuing to study if the new surface field patterns can generate individual sunspots and the full 11-year solar cycle.", "source": {"uri": "scienmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scienmag: Latest Science and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vibration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shear stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioseismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helioseismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Santa Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kinetic energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Classical_Mechanics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Classical Mechanics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://scienmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-origin-of-the-suns-magnetic-field-could-lie-close.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

In contrast, their simulations in deeper layers produced less realistic solar activity.\n\nThe findings suggest that sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, rather than a field that originates deeper in the sun, as scientists had largely assumed.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" says study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mathematics. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nIf the sun's magnetic field does in fact arise from its outermost layers, this might give scientists a better chance at forecasting flares and geomagnetic storms that have the potential to damage satellites and telecommunications systems.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,\" says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. \"But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.\"\n\nThe study's co-authors also include Daniel Lecoanet and Kyle Augustson of Northwestern University, Jeffrey Oishi of Bates College, Benjamin Brown and Keith Julien of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Nicholas Brummell of the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nFlow zone\n\nThe sun is a white-hot ball of plasma that's boiling on its surface. This boiling region is called the \"convection zone,\" where layers and plumes of plasma roil and flow. The convection zone comprises the top one-third of the sun's radius and stretches about 200,000 kilometers below the surface.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explains. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nTo pin down exactly where the sun's magnetic field originates, other scientists have used large three-dimensional simulations to try to solve for the flow of plasma throughout the many layers of the sun's interior. \"Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,\" Burns says.\n\nRather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, Burns and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.\n\nTo explore this idea, the team first used data from the field of \"helioseismology,\" where scientists use observed vibrations on the sun's surface to determine the average structure and flow of plasma beneath the surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns says. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside.\"\n\nSolar onion\n\nFor their new study, the researchers collected models of the sun's structure from helioseismic observations. \"These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other,\" Burns explains. \"Then we ask: Are there perturbations, or tiny changes in the flow of plasma, that we could superimpose on top of this average structure, that might grow to cause the sun's magnetic field?\"\n\nTo look for such patterns, the team utilized the Dedalus Project -- a numerical framework that Burns developed that can simulate many types of fluid flows with high precision. The code has been applied to a wide range of problems, from modeling the dynamics inside individual cells, to ocean and atmospheric circulations.\n\n\"My collaborators have been thinking about the solar magnetism problem for years, and the capabilities of Dedalus have now reached the point where we could address it,\" Burns says.\n\nThe team developed algorithms that they incorporated into Dedalus to find self-reinforcing changes in the sun's average surface flows. The algorithm discovered new patterns that could grow and result in realistic solar activity. In particular, the team found patterns that match the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo in 1612.\n\nSunspots are transient features on the surface of the sun that are thought to be shaped by the sun's magnetic field. These relatively cooler regions appear as dark spots in relation to the rest of the sun's white-hot surface. Astronomers have long observed that sunspots occur in a cyclical pattern, growing and receding every 11 years, and generally gravitating around the equator, rather than near the poles.\n\nIn the team's simulations, they found that certain changes in the flow of plasma, within just the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun's surface layers, were enough to generate magnetic structures in the same regions. In contrast, changes in deeper layers produce less realistic solar fields that are concentrated near the poles, rather than near the equator.\n\nThe team was motivated to take a closer look at flow patterns near the surface as conditions there resembled the unstable plasma flows in entirely different systems: the accretion disks around black holes. Accretion disks are massive disks of gas and stellar dust that rotate in towards a black hole, driven by the \"magnetorotational instability,\" which generates turbulence in the flow and causes it to fall inward.\n\nBurns and his colleagues suspected that a similar phenomena is at play in the sun, and that the magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers could be the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" he ventures. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\" Burns says that the team is continuing to study if the new surface field patterns can generate individual sunspots and the full 11-year solar cycle.\n\nThis research was supported, in part, by NASA.", "source": {"uri": "news.mit.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_chu@news.mit.edu", "name": "Jennifer Chu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar Dynamics Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vibration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shear stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Santa Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202405/MIT-SolarSurface-01-press.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-12", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 355}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Now, after running a series of complex calculations on a NASA supercomputer, the researchers discovered the magnetic field is generated about 20,000 miles below the sun's surface.\n\nThe finding contradicts previous theories, which suggest the phenomenon has deep origins -- beginning more than 130,000 miles below the sun's surface.\n\nThe research will be published on May 22 in the journal Nature.\n\nNot only does the new discovery help us better understand our sun's dynamic processes, it also could help scientists more accurately forecast powerful solar storms. Although this month's strong solar storms released beautiful, extended views of the Northern Lights, similar storms can cause intense destruction -- damaging Earth-orbiting satellites, electricity grids and radio communications.\n\n\"Understanding the origin of the sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth,\" said study co-author Daniel Lecoanet. \"This work proposes a new hypothesis for how the sun's magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity.\"\n\nAn expert in astrophysical fluid dynamics, Lecoanet is an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics. Geoffrey Vasil, a mathematics professor at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, led the study.\n\nPuzzling history\n\nFor centuries, astronomers have studied the tell-tale signs of the sun's magnetic activity. Among them was Galileo, who made the first detailed observations of sunspots in 1612. Using early telescopes and even his naked-eye, Galileo documented the shifting dark patches caused by the sun's ever-changing magnetic field.\n\nOver the years, astronomers have made significant progress in understanding the origins of the solar dynamo -- the physical process that generates the magnetic field -- but limitations have remained. Theories suggesting the dynamo has a deep origin, for example, predict solar features that astronomers have never observed, such as strong magnetic fields at high latitudes.\n\nMissing pieces\n\nTo solve this puzzle, the research team developed new, state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the sun's magnetic field. Unlike previous models, the new model accounts for torsional oscillations, a cyclical pattern of how gas and plasma flow within and around the sun. Because the sun is not solid like the Earth and moon, it doesn't rotate as one body. Instead, its rotation varies with latitude. Like the 11-year solar magnetic cycle, torsional oscillations also experience an 11-year cycle.\n\n\"Because the wave has the same period as the magnetic cycle, it has been thought that these phenomena were linked,\" Lecoanet said. \"However, the traditional 'deep theory' of the solar magnetic field does not explain where these torsional oscillations come from. An intriguing clue is that the torsional oscillations are only near the surface of the sun. Our hypothesis is that the magnetic cycle and the torsional oscillations are different manifestations of the same physical process.\"\n\nWhen Kyle Augustson, a postdoctoral fellow in Lecoanet's lab at Northwestern, ran the numerical simulations, the researchers found their new model provided a quantitative explanation for properties observed in the torsional oscillations. The model also explains how sunspots follow patterns of the sun's magnetic activity -- another detail missing from the deep origin theory.\n\nImproving predictions\n\nWith a better understanding of the sun's dynamo, researchers hope to improve forecasts for solar storms. When solar flares and coronal mass ejections launch toward Earth, they can severely damage electrical and telecommunications infrastructure, including GPS navigation tools. This month's recent solar storms, for example, knocked out navigational systems for farming equipment -- right at peak planting season.\n\nBut the researchers look to an even more powerful solar storm that hit Canada in September 1859 as a cautionary tale. Dubbed the Carrington Event, the intense storm damaged the country's fledgling telegraph system. With enough warning, engineers could take steps to prevent catastrophic damage in the future.\n\n\"While the recent solar storms were powerful, we're worried about even more powerful storms like the Carrington Event,\" Lecoanet said. \"If a storm of similar intensity hit the United States today, it would cause an estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in damage. Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical physics and opens the way to better predictions of dangerous solar activity.\"\n\nThe study, \"The solar dynamo begins near the surface,\" was supported by NASA (grant numbers 80NSSC20K1280, 80NSSC22K1738 and 80NSSC22M0162).

Analysis using SOHO spacecraft data and new theoretical models shows its magnetic field is generated in the sun's outer zone. These discoveries could enhance solar storm forecasting, protecting Earth's technological systems.\n\nThe sun's magnetic field, which causes solar storms like the one that hit Earth this month and produced beautiful auroras, may originate at shallower depths in the star's interior than previously thought, according to researchers.\n\nThe sun's outer 30% is comprised of an \"ocean\" of churning gases plunging more than 130,000 miles (210,000 km) below the solar surface. The research, comparing new theoretical models to observations by the sun-observing SOHO spacecraft, provides strong evidence that its magnetic field is generated near the top of this ocean - less than 5% inward, or about 20,000 miles (32,000 km) - rather than near the bottom, as long hypothesized. In addition to providing insight into the sun's dynamic processes, the findings may improve the ability to forecast solar storms and guard against potential damage to electricity grids, radio communications and orbiting satellites, the researchers said.\n\nMost stars have magnetic fields, apparently generated by the motion of super-hot gases inside them. The sun's ever-changing magnetic field drives the formation of sunspots - shifting dark patches - on its surface and triggers solar flares that blast hot charged particles into space. \"The top 5% to 10% of the sun is a region where the winds are perfect for making abundant magnetic fields through a fascinating astrophysical process,\" said Geoffrey Vasil, an applied and computational mathematician at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nThis process involves rotational flow patterns of super-hot ionized - electrically charged - gases called plasma inside the sun. The precise mechanisms behind how the sun generates its magnetic field - the solar dynamo, as the scientists call it - has remained an unsolved problem in theoretical physics. These researchers hypothesize that these flow patterns are the key.\n\n\"If the plasma which constitutes the sun was completely stationary, we know the sun's magnetic field would decay in time, and before long, there would be no sunspots or other solar activity. However, the plasma in the sun is moving around, and that motion is able to regenerate and maintain the sun's magnetic field,\" said theoretical physicist and study co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University in Illinois. The solar magnetic field ebbs and flows in a distinct pattern, with sunspots - regions with very large magnetic fields - emerging and then vanishing every 11 years, making the sun, as Vasil called it, \"a giant magnetic clock.\"\n\n\"But we have yet to find the full story about how it happens. Complex interacting fluid motions (in this case, the solar plasma) ultimately drive a dynamo, but we can't yet explain the details,\" Vasil added. Italian polymath Galileo carried out in 1612 the first detailed observations of sunspots using telescopes he invented. American astronomer George Hale in the early 20th century determined that sunspots were magnetic.\n\n\"And we're still scratching our heads about these pesky sunspots,\" Vasil said. A strong solar storm that reached Earth this month caused bright auroras in the skies, though Earth's technological infrastructure remained unscathed.\n\n\"Occasionally, a group of sunspots explodes and launches a billion tons of hot charged particles toward Earth, like what happened last week,\" Vasil said. But a powerful solar storm like one that occurred in 1859 called the Carrington Event could cause trillions of dollars in damage and leave hundreds of millions of people without power, the researchers said.\n\n\"You can think of magnetic fields as being like rubber bands. The motions near the surface of the sun can stretch out the rubber bands until they break. The breaking magnetic field can then launch material outward into space in what is called a solar storm. If we're unlucky, these storms can be launched toward the Earth and can cause significant damage to our satellites and power grid,\" Lecoanet added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar and Heliospheric Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronal mass ejection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charged particle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theoretical physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric charge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ionization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Ellery Hale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_07_2020_15_20_36_6866972.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Yet, ever since astronomers began investigating the sun's magnetic fields, the point from which they originate has remained undetermined. Now, an international team of researchers may be closer to solving this 400-year-old mystery that confounded even Galileo Galilei.\n\nThe discovery means that sunspots and flares are likely to be the product of a shallow magnetic field rather than a field that originates deeper within the sun, something that had previously been theorized. The team's findings could help solar scientists better predict solar flares and geomagnetic storms that pose a risk to Earth's satellites, communications systems, and power infrastructure while also providing a strange link between the outer layers of the sun and feeding black holes.\n\nRelated: The stormy sun erupts with its biggest solar flare yet from a massive sunspot -- and it's still crackling (video)\n\nUsing a NASA supercomputer, the team behind this research performed a series of complex calculations that showed the sun's magnetic field is generated around 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) below its surface, the photosphere. This may seem incredibly deep, but the sun has a radius of around 433,000 miles (697,000 km), meaning the magnetic fields are generated in the outer 10% of the sun's superheated plasma.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" team member Keaton Burns, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said in a statement. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe sun generates its magnetic field via a physical process that scientists call the solar dynamo. Previous models of this dynamo have suggested it is kick-started in a roiling and turbulent region of the sun called the convection zone. Here, hot plasma rises away from the core of the sun, where the majority of its energy is generated, carrying heat and energy to the surface of the sun, the photosphere.\n\nAfter the energy is deposited, the plasma cools and falls back through the convection zone, which has a depth of around 124,000 miles (200,000 km) and accounts for around 30% of the sun's volume, past the next \"batch\" of rising heated plasma.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explained. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nOther teams of researchers have previously created three-dimensional simulations of the sun to model the flow of plasma throughout its various layers and to thus determine where its magnetic field originates. The team argues that these simulations failed to pinpoint the true starting point of the solar dynamo because they failed to capture the true picture of just how chaotic and turbulent the sun actually is.\n\nBurns and his team took a different approach. Instead of modeling the flow of plasma throughout all the layers in the interior of the sun, they focused on the stability of plasma at the solar surface. They wanted to determine if changes in this surface region would be enough to start the solar dynamo.\n\nTo begin, Burns and colleagues used a process called \"helioseismology\" that measures trapped soundwaves as they ripple through the sun and cause oscillations called \"starquakes\" at the solar surface to determine the interior of the sun. This allowed them to determine the structure and flow of plasma just beneath the solar surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns said. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside. These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other.\"\n\nThe team turned to the Dedalus Project, a framework developed by Burns that can simulate fluid flows with high precision, to look at this flow of solar plasma and then see if any tiny changes or \"perturbations\" could be introduced to the regular structure that could grow and cause the solar dynamo.\n\nTheir algorithm discovered new patterns in the flow of plasma that can grow and create a picture of real solar activity. These patterns matched the locations of sunspots that astronomers have been seeing since 1612 and the observations of Galileo.\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe Dedalus Project simulations revealed that changes in plasma flows in the top 5% to 10% of the sun were sufficient enough to generate magnetic structures that can account for observed sunspot activity. When they modeled deeper regions of our star as the source of magnetic fields, this led to sunspots congregating at the poles of the sun rather than its equator, which is the opposite of what is actually seen by astronomers.\n\nTaking a closer look at how plasma flowed at the surface of the sun, Burns and colleagues also found a surprising similarity to the immediate environments of black holes.\n\nWhen stars venture too close to black holes, they can be destroyed by massive gravitational forces that squash them horizontally and squeeze them vertically, \"spaghettifying\" them in an occurrence called a tidal disruption event (TDE).\n\nFurthermore, in situations when a star orbits a black hole in a binary system and is either too close, or its outer layers have \"puffed out,\" the gravitational influence of the black hole can strip away stellar material.\n\nIn both the cases of stellar cannibalism and in less extreme situations when black holes are in regions of gas and dust, this superheated plasma has angular momentum (or spin), and that means it can't just fall into the black hole.\n\nInstead, this plasma forms a flattened cloud around the black hole that gradually feeds it and is subject to immense frictional forces due to the gravity of the black hole that heats it, causing it to glow. This 'platter' of plasma is called an accretion disk. Accretion disks are turbulent and feed black holes because of co-called \"magnetorotational instability\" in their flow of plasma. This turbulence is created when magnetized material closer to the edge of an accretion disk moves more slowly than material closer to its center.\n\nBurns and team think that a similar phenomenon is happening in the sun's magnetic field, and it is this magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers that is the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" Burns added. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- Behemoth sunspot AR3664 unleashes its biggest solar flare yet\n\n-- Sun explodes in a flurry of powerful solar flares from hyperactive sunspots (video)\n\n-- Wild solar weather is causing satellites to fall.

The research, comparing new theoretical models to observations by the sun-observing SOHO spacecraft, provides strong evidence that its magnetic field is generated near the top of this ocean - less than 5% inward, or about 20,000 miles (32,000 km) - rather than near the bottom, as long hypothesized.\n\nIn addition to providing insight into the sun's dynamic processes, the findings may improve the ability to forecast solar storms and guard against potential damage to electricity grids, radio communications and orbiting satellites, the researchers said.\n\nMost stars have magnetic fields, apparently generated by the motion of super-hot gases inside them. The sun's ever-changing magnetic field drives the formation of sunspots - shifting dark patches - on its surface and triggers solar flares that blast hot charged particles into space.\n\n\"The top 5% to 10% of the sun is a region where the winds are perfect for making abundant magnetic fields through a fascinating astrophysical process,\" said Geoffrey Vasil, an applied and computational mathematician at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nThis process involves rotational flow patterns of super-hot ionized - electrically charged - gases called plasma inside the sun.\n\nThe precise mechanisms behind how the sun generates its magnetic field - the solar dynamo, as the scientists call it - has remained an unsolved problem in theoretical physics.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nNew research indicates the sun's magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month.\n\nThe magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) beneath the sun's surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) below, an international team reported Wednesday.\n\nThe sun's intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.\n\n\"We still don't understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.\n\nThe latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.\n\nGalileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun's shifting magnetic field.\n\nVasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun's magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California -- the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison's Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.\n\nThe new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star's future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.\n\nStrong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.\n\nBetter understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm -- potentially much more dangerous -- hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

the tell-tale signs of magnetic solar activity - was documented by Galileo as early as 1612.\n\nSince then, astronomers have attempted to understand where the sun's ever-changing magnetic field comes from.\n\nThe widely held view is that it is generated deep within the star, around 130,000 miles below the sun's surface.\n\nHowever, modelling now suggests this may not be the case and the solar phenomenon is much shallower than previously thought -

This finding could improve solar storm forecasts", "body": "New research indicates the sun's magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- New research indicates the sun's magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month.\n\nThe magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) beneath the sun's surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) below, an international team reported Wednesday.\n\nThe sun's intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.\n\n\"We still don't understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.\n\nThe latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.\n\nGalileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun's shifting magnetic field.\n\nVasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun's magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California -- the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison's Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.\n\nThe new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star's future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.\n\nStrong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.\n\nBetter understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm -- potentially much more dangerous -- hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The sun's ever-changing magnetic field drives the formation of sunspots - shifting dark patches - on its surface and triggers solar flares that blast hot charged particles into space.\n\n\"The top 5% to 10% of the sun is a region where the winds are perfect for making abundant magnetic fields through a fascinating astrophysical process,\" said Geoffrey Vasil, an applied and computational mathematician at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nThis process involves rotational flow patterns of super-hot ionized - electrically charged - gases called plasma inside the sun.\n\nThe precise mechanisms behind how the sun generates its magnetic field - the solar dynamo, as the scientists call it - has remained an unsolved problem in theoretical physics. These researchers hypothesize that these flow patterns are the key.\n\n\"If the plasma which constitutes the sun was completely stationary, we know the sun's magnetic field would decay in time, and before long, there would be no sunspots or other solar activity. However, the plasma in the sun is moving around, and that motion is able to regenerate and maintain the sun's magnetic field,\" said theoretical physicist and study co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\nThe solar magnetic field ebbs and flows in a distinct pattern, with sunspots - regions with very large magnetic fields - emerging and then vanishing every 11\u2009years, making the sun, as Vasil called it, \"a giant magnetic clock.\"\n\n\"But we have yet to find the full story about how it happens. Complex interacting fluid motions (in this case, the solar plasma) ultimately drive a dynamo, but we can't yet explain the details,\" Vasil added.\n\nItalian polymath Galileo carried out in 1612 the first detailed observations of sunspots using telescopes he invented. American astronomer George Hale in the early 20th century determined that sunspots were magnetic.\n\n\"And we're still scratching our heads about these pesky sunspots,\" Vasil said.\n\nA strong solar storm that reached Earth this month caused bright auroras in the skies, though Earth's technological infrastructure remained unscathed.\n\n\"Occasionally, a group of sunspots explodes and launches a billion tons of hot charged particles toward Earth, like what happened last week,\" Vasil said.\n\nBut a powerful solar storm like one that occurred in 1859 called the Carrington Event could cause trillions of dollars in damage and leave hundreds of millions of people without power, the researchers said.\n\n\"You can think of magnetic fields as being like rubber bands. The motions near the surface of the sun can stretch out the rubber bands until they break. The breaking magnetic field can then launch material outward into space in what is called a solar storm. If we're unlucky, these storms can be launched toward the Earth and can cause significant damage to our satellites and power grid,\" Lecoanet added.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_and_Heliospheric_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar and Heliospheric Observatory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theoretical physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charged particle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric charge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ionization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrington Event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Ellery Hale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polymath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-05%2F3d0f17fb-610e-463f-8a85-60ee6604c7d5%2Fdownload.png?rect=0%2C0%2C1280%2C672&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

the sun known as sunspots - the tell-tale signs of magnetic solar activity - was documented by Galileo as early as 1612.\n\nSince then, astronomers have attempted to understand where the sun's

not be the case and the solar phenomenon is much shallower than previously thought - about 20,000 miles underneath.\n\nThey said the findings, published in the journal Nature, could help scientists

contrast, the researchers said, the changes in deeper layers produced less realistic solar fields, concentrated near the Sun's poles rather than the equator.\n\nThe models were also able to demonstrate how sunspots are linked to the sun's magnetic activity.\n\nThe researchers said the patterns seen in the simulations matched the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have

Yet, ever since astronomers began investigating the sun's magnetic fields, the point from which they originate has remained undetermined. Now, an international team of researchers may be closer to solving this 400-year-old mystery that confounded even Galileo Galilei. The discovery means that sunspots and flares are likely to be the product of a shallow magnetic field rather than a field that originates deeper within the sun, something that had previously been theorized. The team's findings could help solar scientists better predict solar flares and geomagnetic storms that pose a risk to Earth's satellites, communications systems, and power infrastructure while also providing a strange link between the outer layers of the sun and feeding black holes.\n\nRelated: The stormy sun erupts with its biggest solar flare yet from a massive sunspot -- and it's still crackling (video)\n\nUsing a NASA supercomputer, the team behind this research performed a series of complex calculations that showed the sun's magnetic field is generated around 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) below its surface, the photosphere. This may seem incredibly deep, but the sun has a radius of around 433,000 miles (697,000 km), meaning the magnetic fields are generated in the outer 10% of the sun's superheated plasma.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" team member Keaton Burns, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said in a statement. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe sun generates its magnetic field via a physical process that scientists call the solar dynamo. Previous models of this dynamo have suggested it is kick-started in a roiling and turbulent region of the sun called the convection zone. Here, hot plasma rises away from the core of the sun, where the majority of its energy is generated, carrying heat and energy to the surface of the sun, the photosphere.\n\nAfter the energy is deposited, the plasma cools and falls back through the convection zone, which has a depth of around 124,000 miles (200,000 km) and accounts for around 30% of the sun's volume, past the next \"batch\" of rising heated plasma.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" Burns explained. \"People had thought that the sun's magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.\"\n\nOther teams of researchers have previously created three-dimensional simulations of the sun to model the flow of plasma throughout its various layers and to thus determine where its magnetic field originates. The team argues that these simulations failed to pinpoint the true starting point of the solar dynamo because they failed to capture the true picture of just how chaotic and turbulent the sun actually is.\n\nBurns and his team took a different approach. Instead of modeling the flow of plasma throughout all the layers in the interior of the sun, they focused on the stability of plasma at the solar surface. They wanted to determine if changes in this surface region would be enough to start the solar dynamo.\n\nTo begin, Burns and colleagues used a process called \"helioseismology\" that measures trapped soundwaves as they ripple through the sun and cause oscillations called \"starquakes\" at the solar surface to determine the interior of the sun. This allowed them to determine the structure and flow of plasma just beneath the solar surface.\n\n\"If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead's shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,\" Burns said. \"Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside. These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other.\"\n\nThe team turned to the Dedalus Project, a framework developed by Burns that can simulate fluid flows with high precision, to look at this flow of solar plasma and then see if any tiny changes or \"perturbations\" could be introduced to the regular structure that could grow and cause the solar dynamo.\n\nTheir algorithm discovered new patterns in the flow of plasma that can grow and create a picture of real solar activity. These patterns matched the locations of sunspots that astronomers have been seeing since 1612 and the observations of Galileo.\n\nSunspots are cool and dark patches on the surface of the sun that scientists think are created when magnetic field lines tangle. Solar scientists have found sunspots increase in number during the solar maximum period of the sun's 11-year solar cycle. Observations have shown that sunspots tend to be found closer to the equator of the sun rather than at the poles of our star.\n\nThe Dedalus Project simulations revealed that changes in plasma flows in the top 5% to 10% of the sun were sufficient enough to generate magnetic structures that can account for observed sunspot activity. When they modeled deeper regions of our star as the source of magnetic fields, this led to sunspots congregating at the poles of the sun rather than its equator, which is the opposite of what is actually seen by astronomers.\n\nTaking a closer look at how plasma flowed at the surface of the sun, Burns and colleagues also found a surprising similarity to the immediate environments of black holes.\n\nWhen stars venture too close to black holes, they can be destroyed by massive gravitational forces that squash them horizontally and squeeze them vertically, \"spaghettifying\" them in an occurrence called a tidal disruption event (TDE).\n\nFurthermore, in situations when a star orbits a black hole in a binary system and is either too close, or its outer layers have \"puffed out,\" the gravitational influence of the black hole can strip away stellar material.\n\nIn both the cases of stellar cannibalism and in less extreme situations when black holes are in regions of gas and dust, this superheated plasma has angular momentum (or spin), and that means it can't just fall into the black hole.\n\nInstead, this plasma forms a flattened cloud around the black hole that gradually feeds it and is subject to immense frictional forces due to the gravity of the black hole that heats it, causing it to glow. This 'platter' of plasma is called an accretion disk. Accretion disks are turbulent and feed black holes because of co-called \"magnetorotational instability\" in their flow of plasma. This turbulence is created when magnetized material closer to the edge of an accretion disk moves more slowly than material closer to its center.\n\nBurns and team think that a similar phenomenon is happening in the sun's magnetic field, and it is this magnetorotational instability in the sun's outermost layers that is the first step in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" Burns added. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"\n\nThe team will now continue their investigation by studying surface magnetic field patterns and attempting to determine if they can create individual sunspots in their simulations and to determine how they link to the overall 11-year cycle of the sun.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,\" Geoffrey Vasil, team member and researcher at the University of Edinburgh, said. \"But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.\"", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black hole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Photosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar corona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar maximum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronal mass ejection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i1.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Scientists-find-weird-link-between-a-solar-mystery-and-feeding.png?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Although this month's strong solar storms released beautiful, extended views of the Northern Lights, similar storms can cause intense destruction -- damaging Earth-orbiting satellites, electricity grids and radio communications.\n\n\"Understanding the origin of the sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth,\" said study co-author Daniel Lecoanet. \"This work proposes a new hypothesis for how the sun's magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity.\"\n\nAn expert in astrophysical fluid dynamics, Lecoanet is an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics. Geoffrey Vasil, a mathematics professor at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, led the study.\n\nFor centuries, astronomers have studied the tell-tale signs of the sun's magnetic activity. Among them was Galileo, who made the first detailed observations of sunspots in 1612. Using early telescopes and even his naked-eye, Galileo documented the shifting dark patches caused by the sun's ever-changing magnetic field.\n\nOver the years, astronomers have made significant progress in understanding the origins of the solar dynamo -- the physical process that generates the magnetic field -- but limitations have remained. Theories suggesting the dynamo has a deep origin, for example, predict solar features that astronomers have never observed, such as strong magnetic fields at high latitudes.\n\nTo solve this puzzle, the research team developed new, state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the sun's magnetic field. Unlike previous models, the new model accounts for torsional oscillations, a cyclical pattern of how gas and plasma flow within and around the sun. Because the sun is not solid like the Earth and moon, it doesn't rotate as one body. Instead, its rotation varies with latitude. Like the 11-year solar magnetic cycle, torsional oscillations also experience an 11-year cycle.\n\n\"Because the wave has the same period as the magnetic cycle, it has been thought that these phenomena were linked,\" Lecoanet said. \"However, the traditional 'deep theory' of the solar magnetic field does not explain where these torsional oscillations come from. An intriguing clue is that the torsional oscillations are only near the surface of the sun. Our hypothesis is that the magnetic cycle and the torsional oscillations are different manifestations of the same physical process.\"\n\nWhen Kyle Augustson, a postdoctoral fellow in Lecoanet's lab at Northwestern, ran the numerical simulations, the researchers found their new model provided a quantitative explanation for properties observed in the torsional oscillations. The model also explains how sunspots follow patterns of the sun's magnetic activity -- another detail missing from the deep origin theory.\n\nWith a better understanding of the sun's dynamo, researchers hope to improve forecasts for solar storms. When solar flares and coronal mass ejections launch toward Earth, they can severely damage electrical and telecommunications infrastructure, including GPS navigation tools. This month's recent solar storms, for example, knocked out navigational systems for farming equipment -- right at peak planting season.\n\nBut the researchers look to an even more powerful solar storm that hit Canada in September 1859 as a cautionary tale. Dubbed the Carrington Event, the intense storm damaged the country's fledgling telegraph system. With enough warning, engineers could take steps to prevent catastrophic damage in the future.\n\n\"While the recent solar storms were powerful, we're worried about even more powerful storms like the Carrington Event,\" Lecoanet said. \"If a storm of similar intensity hit the United States today, it would cause an estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in damage. Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical physics and opens the way to better predictions of dangerous solar activity.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eurasia_review@eurasiareview.com", "name": "Eurasia Review", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stellar magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applied mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fluid dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-170.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Among them was Galileo, who made the first detailed observations of sunspots in 1612. Using early telescopes and even his naked-eye, Galileo documented the shifting dark patches caused by the sun's ever-changing magnetic field.\n\nOver the years, astronomers have made significant progress in understanding the origins of the solar dynamo -- the physical process that generates the magnetic field -- but limitations have remained. Theories suggesting the dynamo has a deep origin, for example, predict solar features that astronomers have never observed, such as strong magnetic fields at high latitudes.\n\nMissing pieces\n\nTo solve this puzzle, the research team developed new, state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the sun's magnetic field. Unlike previous models, the new model accounts for torsional oscillations, a cyclical pattern of how gas and plasma flow within and around the sun. Because the sun is not solid like the Earth and moon, it doesn't rotate as one body. Instead, its rotation varies with latitude. Like the 11-year solar magnetic cycle, torsional oscillations also experience an 11-year cycle.\n\n\"Because the wave has the same period as the magnetic cycle, it has been thought that these phenomena were linked,\" Lecoanet said. \"However, the traditional 'deep theory' of the solar magnetic field does not explain where these torsional oscillations come from. An intriguing clue is that the torsional oscillations are only near the surface of the sun. Our hypothesis is that the magnetic cycle and the torsional oscillations are different manifestations of the same physical process.\"\n\nWhen Kyle Augustson, a postdoctoral fellow in Lecoanet's lab at Northwestern, ran the numerical simulations, the researchers found their new model provided a quantitative explanation for properties observed in the torsional oscillations. The model also explains how sunspots follow patterns of the sun's magnetic activity -- another detail missing from the deep origin theory.\n\nImproving predictions\n\nWith a better understanding of the sun's dynamo, researchers hope to improve forecasts for solar storms. When solar flares and coronal mass ejections launch toward Earth, they can severely damage electrical and telecommunications infrastructure, including GPS navigation tools. This month's recent solar storms, for example, knocked out navigational systems for farming equipment -- right at peak planting season.\n\nBut the researchers look to an even more powerful solar storm that hit Canada in September 1859 as a cautionary tale. Dubbed the Carrington Event, the intense storm damaged the country's fledgling telegraph system. With enough warning, engineers could take steps to prevent catastrophic damage in the future.\n\n\"While the recent solar storms were powerful, we're worried about even more powerful storms like the Carrington Event,\" Lecoanet said. \"If a storm of similar intensity hit the United States today, it would cause an estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in damage. Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical physics and opens the way to better predictions of dangerous solar activity.\"\n\nThe study, \"The solar dynamo begins near the surface,\" was supported by NASA (grant numbers 80NSSC20K1280, 80NSSC22K1738 and 80NSSC22M0162). Computations were conducted with support by the NASA High End Computing Program through the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames Research Center.\n\n/Public Release.

The outer third of the sun -- stretching about 120,000 miles -- is known as the convection zone, and consists of hot plasma that rises, cools and then sinks in a continuous cycle that plays a crucial role in generating the sun's magnetic field.\n\n\"If the plasma which constitutes the Sun was completely stationary, we know the Sun's magnetic field would decay in time, and before long, there would be no sunspots [regions of strong magnetic field] or other solar activity,\" Lecoanet said.\n\n\"However, the plasma in the Sun is moving around, and that motion is able to regenerate and maintain the Sun's magnetic field. This is called the dynamo effect, and must be occurring, otherwise there would be no sun spots! While this basic picture has been known for over a century, the details of this dynamo effect have eluded scientists.\"\n\nThe magnetic field was originally thought to originate deep within our star, but this would result in certain solar features that aren't seen, such as strong magnetic fields at high latitudes, and doesn't explain how sunspots follow the sun's magnetic cycle.\n\n\"Previous work assumed the magnetic field was generated about 30 percent [into] the Sun, which corresponds to about 130,000 miles below the surface. That deep in the Sun, the winds get weaker the further you descend into the Sun, and these differences in wind speeds may generate magnetic fields. However, previous work has shown that it is very difficult to get the magnetic field from such depths all the way up to the surface,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nIn the new paper, the researchers describe how they modeled the sun's magnetic field using new numeral simulations, which accounted for special cycles of gas and plasma flowing within the sun that vary with latitude.\n\n\"Our new work suggests the Sun's magnetic field is generated by winds located about 1-5 percent into the Sun, which corresponds to about 20,000 miles below the surface,\" researchers said. \"The winds in the Sun get stronger the deeper you go until you reach a depth of about 5 percent. The difference in the wind speed at the surface vs deeper into the Sun can amplify magnetic fields via a process known as the 'magnetorotational instability.'\"\n\nThis process is well-known in astrophysics as a way of explaining the behavior of plasma orbiting black holes, but had not been thought to be important in the sun until this work, Lecoanet said.\n\n\"We specifically focused our attention on this near-surface region precisely because we thought the conditions were right for the magnetorotational. Our calculations show that indeed this process is occurring near the surface of the Sun,\" Lecoanet said. \"Furthermore, our calculations show that the magnetic fields and winds produced by the magnetorotational instability match certain observed features of the Sun [the \"torsional oscillations\" and helicity patterns].\n\n\"Previous theories, which assume the field is generated deep within the Sun, are not able to match these features. The surprising match to observations is strong evidence in favor of our new hypothesis that the Sun's magnetic field is generated near its surface.\"\n\nThe researchers hope that the new findings can help scientists predict solar weather like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can cause geomagnetic storms like the one that sparked auroras across the world on May 10.\n\n\"We hope our new theory for how the Sun generates its magnetic field will lead to more accurate predictions of solar storms, helping us prepare for massive solar storms -- even stronger than the one that hit a couple of weeks ago -- that might hit us in the future,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nThis could be important for predicting storms that could cause damage to satellites, trigger radio blackouts, and cause issues with the electrical grid.\n\nThe Carrington Event in 1859 is thought to have been the strongest solar flare and geomagnetic storm in history, triggering fires in telegraph stations.\n\n\"In that strongest-ever Carrington Event, there were reports of telegraph lines sparking with the voltages induced in them,\" Alan Woodward, a professor of computer science and space weather expert at the University of Surrey, previously told Newsweek. \"If that were to happen today, you can imagine just how much electronic equipment we depend upon and extrapolate how it is disruptive on Earth.\"\n\nEven the May 10 storm triggered GPS systems to fail for some farming equipment, but a future Carrington-level storm could be catastrophic without warning.\n\n\"While the recent solar storms were powerful, we're worried about even more powerful storms like the Carrington Event,\" Lecoanet said in a statement. \"If a storm of similar intensity hit the United States today, it would cause an estimated $1 trillion to $2 trillion in damage.\n\n\"Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved

If the findings are right, their discovery could give scientists a better chance of predicting solar flares and storms that can cause power outages,\n\ncripple the internet and even send satellites tumbling to Earth. The researchers revealed their findings in a study published May 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" co-author Keaton Burns, a research scientist at MIT, said in a statement. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"\n\nThe sun is a gigantic ball of plasma whose charged ions swirl to create powerful magnetic fields. This region of roiling, flowing plasma, known as the \"convection zone,\" comprises the top third of the sun's radius -- stretching from the surface to roughly 124,000 miles (200,000 kilometers) beneath its surface.\n\nRelated: Solar maximum may already be upon us, expert warns -- but we won't know for sure until the sun's explosive peak is over\n\nMagnetic field lines cannot cross each other, so sometimes these fields knot into kinks before suddenly snapping -- which in turn launches bursts of radiation called solar flares or enormous plumes of solar material called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) out into space. Once launched, CMEs travel at millions of miles per hour, sweeping up charged particles from the solar wind to form a giant, combined wavefront that, if pointed toward Earth, can trigger geomagnetic storms over our planet.\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBut researchers weren't sure exactly where most of the sun's magnetism originates from. Previously, scientists have tried to work it out using 3D computer simulations to map the flow of plasma, but these models tended to be too simple.\n\n\"Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,\" Burns said.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers instead turned to data taken from a field known as helioseismology, which uses observations of vibrations rippling across the sun's outer surface to infer the structure inside.\n\nThe researchers created their model using algorithms of these surface vibrations, and the results suggested that changes in the flow of plasma across the top 5% to 10% of the sun's surface most closely matched the magnetic fields seen from the outside. When they added possible effects produced by the sun's deeper layers to the simulation, the picture became muddier -- no longer pairing with the sun's observed magnetic field.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" Burns said. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nBy further developing their model, the researchers hope to better understand and eventually predict solar storms.

(Image credit: Eduardo Schaberger Poupeau)\n\nScientists have found the possible origins of the sun's magnetic field, and it's not where they thought it was.\n\nThe discovery, made using complex computer simulations, suggests that the sun's magnetic field arises from instabilities in the plasma across the outermost layers of the solar surface, rather than from deep within the star as researchers previously thought.\n\nIf the findings are right, their discovery could give scientists a better chance of predicting solar flares and storms that can cause power outages, cripple the internet and even send satellites tumbling to Earth. The researchers revealed their findings in a study published May 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" co-author Keaton Burns, a research scientist at MIT, said in a statement. \"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"\n\nThe sun is a gigantic ball of plasma whose charged ions swirl to create powerful magnetic fields. This region of roiling, flowing plasma, known as the \"convection zone,\" comprises the top third of the sun's radius -- stretching from the surface to roughly 124,000 miles (200,000 kilometers) beneath its surface.\n\nRelated: Solar maximum may already be upon us, expert warns -- but we won't know for sure until the sun's explosive peak is over\n\nMagnetic field lines cannot cross each other, so sometimes these fields knot into kinks before suddenly snapping -- which in turn launches bursts of radiation called solar flares or enormous plumes of solar material called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) out into space. Once launched, CMEs travel at millions of miles per hour, sweeping up charged particles from the solar wind to form a giant, combined wavefront that, if pointed toward Earth, can trigger geomagnetic storms over our planet.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nBut researchers weren't sure exactly where most of the sun's magnetism originates from. Previously, scientists have tried to work it out using 3D computer simulations to map the flow of plasma, but these models tended to be too simple.\n\n\"Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,\" Burns said.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers instead turned to data taken from a field known as helioseismology, which uses observations of vibrations rippling across the sun's outer surface to infer the structure inside.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- Sun launches strongest solar flare of current cycle in monster X8.7-class eruption\n\n-- No, you didn't see a solar flare during the total eclipse -- but you may have seen something just as special\n\n-- What if the Carrington Event, the largest solar storm ever recorded, happened today?\n\nThe researchers created their model using algorithms of these surface vibrations, and the results suggested that changes in the flow of plasma across the top 5% to 10% of the sun's surface most closely matched the magnetic fields seen from the outside. When they added possible effects produced by the sun's deeper layers to the simulation, the picture became muddier -- no longer pairing with the sun's observed magnetic field.\n\n\"The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun's magnetic field,\" Burns said. \"We show that isolated perturbations near the sun's surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.\"\n\nBy further developing their model, the researchers hope to better understand and eventually predict solar storms.

Now, after running a series of complex calculations on a NASA supercomputer, the researchers discovered the magnetic field is generated about 20,000 miles below the sun's surface.\n\nThe finding contradicts previous theories, which suggest the phenomenon has deep origins -- beginning more than 130,000 miles below the sun's surface.\n\nThe research was published today (May 22) in the journal Nature.\n\nNot only does the new discovery help us better understand our sun's dynamic processes, it also could help scientists more accurately forecast powerful solar storms. Although this month's strong solar storms released beautiful, extended views of the Northern Lights, similar storms can cause intense destruction -- damaging Earth-orbiting satellites, electricity grids and radio communications.\n\n\"Understanding the origin of the sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth,\" said study co-author Daniel Lecoanet. \"This work proposes a new hypothesis for how the sun's magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity.\"\n\nAn expert in astrophysical fluid dynamics, Lecoanet is an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics.

powerful solar storms that cause the Northern Lights to appear in the night skies.\n\nThese storms can also cause cause destruction - wrecking Earth-orbiting satellites, electricity grids and radio communications - so knowing when these events will occur can prepare countries worldwide for potential damage.\n\nDaniel Lecoanet, an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics in the US, said: \"Understanding the origin of the sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth.\"\n\nHe added: \"Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical physics and opens the way to better predictions of dangerous solar activity.\"\n\nThe sunspots and flares that appear on the Sun's surface are driven by its magnetic field, which is internally generated through a process called dynamo action.\n\nTo find out more, the researchers developed state-of-the-art models to simulate the solar magnetic field.\n\nIt showed that changes in the flow of the super-hot ionised gas (known as the plasma) within the Sun's surface layers were enough to generate magnetic fields in the same regions.\n\nIn contrast, the researchers said, the changes in deeper layers produced less realistic solar fields, concentrated near the Sun's poles rather than the equator.\n\nThe models were also able to demonstrate how sunspots are linked to the sun's magnetic activity.\n\nThe researchers said the patterns seen in the simulations matched the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo.\n\nKeaton Burns, a research scientist in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Mathematics in the US, said: \"I think this result may be controversial.\n\n\"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun.\n\n\"Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"", "source": {"uri":

For decades, scientists thought the sun's dynamo - the area that generates its powerful magnetic field - was located far within the star. Now, evidence suggests the dynamo lurks just under the sun's surface.\n\nThe strength of the sun's magnetic field fluctuates in a distinct 11-year cycle. During the strongest part of the cycle, sunspots and powerful winds emerge near the solar equator, along with the plumes of material that cause the aurora borealis on Earth. Ideas for how the magnetic field is generated have had a difficult time explaining how all of those phenomena are connected.\n\nEssentially, the sun behaves like a giant clock, with the many eddies and flows of plasma within it acting as the gears that make it tick, says Geoffrey Vasil at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. \"Nobody really knows how those things fit together or even what they all are, and you can't explain the whole clock if you don't know how it starts.\"\n\nVasil and his colleagues suggest that the sun's magnetic field might stem from instability in the rotation of plasma inside the star, which is common in other astrophysical objects like the discs of hot matter orbiting some black holes. Such instability may occur in the outermost 5 to 10 per cent of the sun.\n\nThe researchers modelled how this instability would churn the plasma that makes up the outer layers of the sun. It may give rise to sunspots and create the powerful winds that whip around the sun during its period of maximum activity, they found, along with other magnetic phenomena. Simulations with a dynamo close to the surface matched observed magnetic patterns on the sun much more closely than those with a deep dynamo.\n\n\"There are all of these clues, and we've been piecing these things together for nearly 20 years,\" says Vasil. \"It's very satisfying to have lots of things fit into place and make a lot of sense.\"\n\nIf the sun's dynamo is generated near its surface, that could make it much easier to study the solar magnetic field and predict its behaviour. \"If the magnetic fields are sitting there, then there is the most hope for actually being able to study them,\" says Vasil.\n\nThis could allow us to better forecast the solar activity that spawn stunning aurorae - and mess with electrical grids on Earth.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddy (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black hole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/21201252/SEI_205370190.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This upends decades of prevailing scientific thought that placed the field more than 130,000 miles below the surface of the sun. It also brings us closer to understanding the nature of the sun's magnetic field, which has been on scientist's minds since Galileo.\n\nThe study, and a team of international researchers, suggests that the magnetic field actually generates 20,000 miles below the surface. This was discovered after the team ran a series of complex calculations on a NASA supercomputer. It's worth noting that these are just initial findings and more research is required to confirm the data.\n\nThe sun's magnetic field fluctuates in a cycle that lasts 11 years. During the strongest part of this cycle, powerful winds and sunspots form at the solar equator, along with plumes of material that cause the here on Earth. Previous theories that place the magnetic field deeper within the sun have had a difficult time connecting these various solar phenomena. Scientists hope that, given further study, they'll be able to use this theory to not only explain the creation of solar events, but more accurately predict when they will occur.\n\nThis could lead to more than just earlier predictions of the next aurora borealis event. The sun's intense magnetic energy is also the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma called coronal mass ejections. When these ejections travel toward Earth, all kinds of bad things happen. This famously occurred back in 1859, when a giant geomagnetic storm created the largest solar storm in recorded history.\n\nThis is , attributed to British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington. The solar flare, which was actually a magnetic explosion on the sun's surface, briefly outshone the sun and caused colored lights to erupt all over the planet, similar to the aurora borealis. It also supercharged telegraph cables, shocking operators, and set telegraph paper on fire. It was pretty nasty.\n\nNow, this was 1859, before the modern use of electricity and before computers and all related technologies. If something like the Carrington Event were to occur today, . The emitted X-rays and ultraviolet light would interfere with electronics, radio and satellite signals. The event would cause a solar radiation storm, which would be deadly to astronauts not fully equipped with protective gear.\n\nIt would also lead a coronal mass ejection to bump up against Earth's magnetic field, which , cell phone satellites, modern cars and even airplanes. The resulting global power outages could last for months. Last month's smallish (relatively speaking) storm and that was no Carrington-sized event. Even worse? We are absolutely due for this to happen. It's basically a ticking time bomb.\n\nSo these findings could, in theory, be used to prepare new early warning methods for large-scale solar flares hitting Earth. Someday, we might have solar flare warnings alongside hurricane warnings and the like. The research has already demonstrated some interesting links between sunspots and the sun's magnetic activity.\n\n\"We still don't understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of solar weather, lead study author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh .

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nThe sun has a powerful magnetic field that creates sunspots on the star's surface and unleashes solar storms such as the one that bathed much of the planet in beautiful auroras this month.\n\nBut exactly how that magnetic field is generated inside the sun is a puzzle that has vexed astronomers for centuries, going back to the time of Italian astronomer Galileo, who made the first observations of sunspots in the early 1600s, and noticed how they varied over time.\n\nResearchers behind an interdisciplinary study have put forth a new theory in a report published Wednesday in the journal Nature. In contrast to previous research that assumed the sun's magnetic field originates from deep within the celestial body, they suspect the the source is much closer to the surface.\n\nThe model developed by the team could help scientists better understand the 11-year solar cycle and improve the forecasting of space weather, which can disrupt GPS and communication satellites as well as dazzle night sky watchers with auroras.\n\n\"This work proposes a new hypothesis for how the sun's magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity,\" said Daniel Lecoanet, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics.\n\n\"We want to forecast if the next solar cycle will be particularly strong, or maybe weaker than normal. The previous models (assuming the solar magnetic field is generated deep within the Sun) have not been able to make accurate forecasts or (determine) if the next solar cycle will be strong or weak,\" he added.\n\nSunspots help scientists track the sun's activity. They are the origin point for the explosive flares and ejection events that release light, solar material and energy into space. The recent solar storm is evidence of the sun approaching \"solar maximum\" -- the point in its 11-year cycle when there is the highest number of sunspots.\n\n\"Because we think the number of sunspots tracks with the strength of the magnetic field within the Sun, we think the 11-year sunspot cycle is reflecting a cycle in the strength of the Sun's interior magnetic field,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nIt's difficult to see the sun's magnetic field lines, which loop through the solar atmosphere to form a complicated web of magnetic structures far more complex than Earth's magnetic field. To better grasp how the sun's magnetic field works, scientists turn to mathematical models.\n\nIn a scientific first, the model that Lecoanet and his colleagues developed accounted for a phenomenon called torsional oscillation -- magnetically driven flows of gas and plasma within and around the sun that contribute to sunspot formation.\n\nIn some areas, the rotation of this solar feature speeds up or slows down, while in others it remains steady. Like the 11-year solar magnetic cycle, torsional oscillations also experience an 11-year cycle.\n\n\"Solar observations have given us a good idea for how material moves around inside of the Sun. For our supercomputing calculations, we solved equations to determine how the magnetic field changes within the Sun due to the observed motions,\" Lecoanet said.\n\n\"No one had done this calculation before because no one knew how to efficiently perform the calculation,\" he added.\n\nThe group's calculations showed that magnetic fields can be generated about 20,000 miles (32,100 kilometers) below the sun's surface -- far closer to the surface than had previously been assumed. Other models had suggested it was much deeper -- around 130,000 miles (209,200 kilometers).\n\n\"Our new hypothesis provides a natural explanation for the torsional oscillations that is missing from previous models,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nAn important breakthrough was developing new numerical algorithms for running the calculations, Lecoanet said. The paper's lead author Geoff Vasil, a professor at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, came up with the idea about 20 years ago, Lecoanet said, but it took over 10 years to develop the algorithms and required a powerful NASA supercomputer to conduct the simulations.\n\n\"We have used around 15 million CPU-hours for this investigation,\" he said. \"That means that if I had tried to run the calculations on my laptop, it would have taken me about 450 years.\"\n\nIn a commentary published alongside the study, Ellen Zweibel, a professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the initial results were intriguing and would help inform future models and research. She was not involved in the study.\n\nZweibel said the team had added \"a provocative ingredient to the theoretical mix that could prove key to unravelling this astrophysical enigma.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Night sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communications satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomical object"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar maximum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applied mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2c51d269a2a44196d0a8ec5c0d922fa0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

This finding...", "body": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - New research indicates the sun\u00b4s magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought, a finding that could help predict periods of extreme solar storms like the ones that slammed Earth earlier this month.\n\nThe magnetic field appears to generate 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) beneath the sun\u00b4s surface. Previous calculations put the roots of this process more than 130,000 miles (209,000 kilometers) below, an international team reported Wednesday.\n\nThe sun\u00b4s intense magnetic energy is the source of solar flares and eruptions of plasma known as coronal mass ejections. When directed toward Earth, they can create stunning auroras but also disrupt power and communications.\n\n\"We still don\u00b4t understand the sun well enough to make accurate predictions\" of space weather, lead author Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh said in an email.\n\nThe latest findings published in the journal Nature \"will be an important step toward finally resolving\" this mysterious process known as solar dynamo, added co-author Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University.\n\nGalileo was among the first astronomers to turn a telescope skyward and study sunspots, back in the early 1600s. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections tend to occur near sunspots, dark patches as big as Earth that are located near the most intense portions of the sun\u00b4s shifting magnetic field.\n\nThis image provided by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows a solar flare, right, on May 14, 2024, captured in the extreme ultraviolet light portion of the spectrum colorized in red and yellow. An international team of mathematicians and scientists reported Wednesday, May 22, 2024, that the sun's magnetic field originates much closer to the surface than previously thought. (NASA/SDO via AP)\n\nVasil and his team developed new models of the interaction between the sun\u00b4s magnetic field and the flow of plasma, which varies at different latitudes during an 11-year cycle. They fed their calculations into a NASA supercomputer in Northern California - the same one used in the 2015 movie \"The Martian\" to verify the best flight path to rescue the main character. The results suggested a shallow magnetic field and additional research is needed to confirm this.\n\nThe modeling was \"highly simplified,\" University of Wisconsin-Madison's Ellen Zweibel, who was not part of the team, said in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe results are intriguing and \"sure to inspire future studies,\" Zweibel said.\n\nThe new knowledge should improve long-term solar forecasts, allowing scientists to better predict the strength of our star's future cycles. The sun is approaching its peak level of activity in the current 11-year cycle, thus the recent flareups.\n\nStrong solar flares and outbursts of billions of tons of plasma earlier this month unleashed severe solar storms that produced auroras in unexpected places. Last week, the sun spewed out the biggest solar flare in almost 20 years, but it steered clear of Earth.\n\nBetter understanding of the sun can ensure \"we are prepared for when the next storm - potentially much more dangerous - hits Earth,\" Lecoanet said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u00b4s Science and Educational Media Group.

field", "body": "The Sun's magnetic field is not as deep as previously thought, scientists have said, shedding new light on its mysterious origins that have puzzled astronomers for 400 years.\n\nDark patches on the Sun known as sunspots - the tell-tale signs of magnetic solar activity - was documented by Italian astronomer Galileo as early as 1612.\n\nSince then, scientists have attempted to understand where the Sun's ever-changing magnetic field comes from.\n\nThe widely held view is that it is generated deep within the star, around 130,000 miles below the Sun's surface.\n\nHowever, modelling now suggests this may not be the case and the solar phenomenon is much shallower than previously thought - about 20,000 miles underneath.\n\nThey said the findings, published in the journal Nature, could help scientists more accurately forecast powerful solar storms that cause the Northern Lights to appear in the night skies.\n\nThese storms can also cause cause destruction - wrecking Earth-orbiting satellites, electricity grids and radio communications - so knowing when these events will occur can prepare countries worldwide for potential damage.\n\nDaniel Lecoanet, an assistant professor at Northwestern University's Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics in the US, said: \"Understanding the origin of the Sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth.\"\n\nHe added: \"Although many aspects of solar dynamics remain shrouded in mystery, our work makes huge strides in cracking one of the oldest unsolved problems in theoretical physics and opens the way to better predictions of dangerous solar activity.\"\n\nThe sunspots and flares that appear on the Sun's surface are driven by its magnetic field, which is internally generated through a process called dynamo action.\n\nTo find out more, the researchers developed state-of-the-art models to simulate the solar magnetic field.\n\nIt showed that changes in the flow of the super-hot ionised gas (known as the plasma) within the Sun's surface layers were enough to generate magnetic fields in the same regions.\n\nIn contrast, the researchers said, the changes in deeper layers produced less realistic solar fields, concentrated near the Sun's poles rather than the equator.\n\nThe models were also able to demonstrate how sunspots are linked to the Sun's magnetic activity.\n\nThe researchers said the patterns seen in the simulations matched the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo.\n\nKeaton Burns, a research scientist in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Mathematics in the US, said: \"I think this result may be controversial.\n\n\"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the Sun.\n\n\"Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

The Renaissance polymath Galileo Galilei made the first detailed observations of sunspots - dark patches caused by changes in the sun's magnetic field - in 1612 using early astronomical telescopes of his invention.\n\nThe solar dynamo converts energy from the sun's roiling, super-hot plasma into a powerful magnetic field. While the sun is known to go through 11-year cycles during which solar activity grows increasingly intense, nearly all the detail about what happens below the surface - including the starting point of the solar dynamo - has remained unclear for centuries.\n\nPrevious research suggested the dynamo process begins at the bottom of a deep ocean of churning gasses more than 130,000 miles below the surface. Now, mathematical modelling using a NASA supercomputer by a team led by the University of Edinburgh indicates the process originates relatively nearer to the surface, some 20,000 miles below.\n\nThey found that strong winds near the solar surface drive the creation of magnetic fields through a process that previous theories had overlooked, called the magnetorotational instability, which also occurs around black holes and young planetary star systems.\n\nImpact on Earth\n\nThe most powerful solar storm known to have hit Earth was the so-called Carrington Event in 1859, which damaged the fledgling telegraph system and caused striking worldwide auroral displays. A storm of similar intensity would wreak havoc on Earth today, the team says, given that so many aspects of modern life depend on electricity. A similar storm in 2012 missed Earth by only nine days.\n\nHowever, with enough warning about incoming solar storms - which can reach Earth in as little as 15 hours - engineers could take steps to prevent catastrophic damage to electronics networks, they add.\n\nThe solar dynamo is the oldest unsolved problem in theoretical physics; it's absolutely fascinating. We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts, but we don't know all the pieces or how they fit together.\n\nKnowing how something starts is essential to understanding and predicting it. My colleagues and I have been working out the details of these ideas for 20 years, it's very satisfying to see the model fit nicely with observational data.\n\nWe found a new idea about how the sun's dynamo happens, which was quite unexpected but makes a lot of sense in the context.\n\nDr Geoffrey VasilSchool of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh\n\nThe team paid tribute to Professor Keith Julien of the University of Colorado Boulder, who was part of the study for many years and passed away after its completion.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, was funded by NASA.

We've struggled with the question ever since.\"\n\nThe researchers, led by Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, published their findings May 22 in the journal Nature. Co-authors of the study included Keith Julien, an applied mathematician from CU Boulder who died in April after a short illness.\n\nThe findings hinge on the dynamo, the term for the complex physics and chemistry in the sun that produce its wild magnetic fields. Earth boasts its own dynamo that powers the planet's magnetic field -- the reason why all compasses on the ground point north.\n\nThe sun's inner workings matter a lot for people, Brown said. The sun's dynamo generates solar storms that, among other things, pose risks to human power grids. Such storms also caused the auroras that appeared in the skies above the United States earlier this month.\n\nFor the researchers, the study represents an achievement decades in the making.\n\n\"Geoff Vasil and I have been thinking about these ideas ever since we were both grad students at CU Boulder 20 years ago,\" Brown said.\n\nIn general, scientists agree that the solar dynamo begins in the sun's \"convection zone,\" or roughly the outer one-third of its interior. There, plumes of hot and charged particles, known as plasma, climb toward the surface.\n\nWhile Earth's magnetic field is mostly uniform, the churn of plasma throughout the sun's convection zone warps and twists its magnetic field lines into a pattern that looks a like a bowl of noodles.\n\nDespite that chaos, the solar dynamo powers behavior that is surprisingly predictable, Brown said. Every 11 years or so, the sun moves from a period of low activity, when sunspots pop up less often, to a period of frenzied activity, when sunspots abound -- then it flips and starts all over again. Right now, the sun's activity is on the frenzied side.\n\n\"You could practically set a calendar to the solar dynamo,\" he said. \"How is it so wild yet also so orderly?\"\n\nTo find out, researchers first need to know exactly where in the sun the dynamo begins. In the 1990s, scientists proposed that the dynamo emerged roughly 130,000 miles below the sun's surface -- a theory nicknamed the \"dynamo in the deep.\"\n\nThat notion, however, struggles to explain the order that emerges from the sun's chaos. Instead, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues turned to a phenomenon in physics called a \"magnetorotational instability.\" It's a sort of imbalance that forms whenever magnetic fields interact with rotating plasmas where those flows move faster as you go deeper.\n\n\"It's kind of like dance partners slinging each other around in a spin while holding arms,\" Brown said.\n\nResearchers have long examined how this phenomenon arises in the disks of hot gases that circle black holes. Its role in the sun is less clear.\n\nIn the current study, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues ran a series of calculations on computers to study how such an instability could influence the sun's activity. They discovered that the process could easily whip up the sun's insides to form the solar dynamo and explain how the 11-year cycles start. Those physics would also take place in the outer 10% of the sun, or a paltry 20,000 miles from the surface. The solar dynamo, in other words, might be powerful, but it's also a little on the shallow side.\n\nThe researchers have a lot of work to do before they can fully cast off the dynamo in the deep theory. But Brown is hopeful that the study could become its own dynamo -- generating a wave of new research in the field.\n\nVasil added that the work is a testament to his colleague and friend, Julien.\n\nAs a doctoral student at CU Boulder, \"My advisors and mentors were Nic Brummell, Juri Toomre and Keith Julien,\" Vasil said. \"I recall first having a 'huh, that's funny' moment about sun's the near-surface instability one morning in 2004 while flipping through an astrophysics textbook. Keith was the first person I literally ran to tell about it. He was such a fantastic friend all these years. He supported ideas and gave encouragement to a generation of energetic young researchers, like I was back then. It's astonishing he won't be here anymore. But he was thrilled this work happened and was to be published in Nature. The silver lining is that his ideas and personality will live on in the astonishing number of people that he inspired over the years.\"", "source": {"uri": "scienmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scienmag: Latest Science and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applied mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charged particle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geomagnetic storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1272, "textEnd": 1278}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Traditionally, scientists believed the Sun's magnetic field, responsible for solar flares and sunspots, originated deep within the star. However, a new study suggests that its magnetic field could arise from instabilities within the outermost layers.\n\nIf confirmed, the findings could help scientists better predict space weather which has critical implications for satellites and telecommunications systems on Earth.\n\nThe team comprising researchers from MIT, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere developed a highly precise model of the Sun's surface and simulated perturbations or changes in the flow of plasma (ionized gas) within the top 5 to 10 percent of the Sun's outer layers.\n\nRather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT's Department of Mathematics, and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.\n\nThey found that these surface changes could trigger the formation of realistic magnetic field patterns, similar to those observed on the Sun. On the other hand, their simulations in deeper layers produced less realistic solar activity.\n\nThe finding implies sunspots and flares might be a product of a shallow magnetic field, not a deep one as previously thought.\n\nThis revelation, if confirmed, could revolutionize space weather prediction, allowing scientists to better forecast potentially damaging solar flares and geomagnetic storms.\n\n\"We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts. But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it,\" says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial. Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations,\" said Burns.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geomagnetic storm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/13_05_2024_16_13_40_6049825.webp?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

We've struggled with the question ever since.\"\n\nThe researchers, led by Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, published their findings May 22 in the journal Nature. Co-authors of the study included Keith Julien, an applied mathematician from CU Boulder who died in April after a short illness.\n\nThe findings hinge on the dynamo, the term for the complex physics and chemistry in the sun that produce its wild magnetic fields. Earth boasts its own dynamo that powers the planet's magnetic field -- the reason why all compasses on the ground point north.\n\nThe sun's inner workings matter a lot for people, Brown said. The sun's dynamo generates solar storms that, among other things, pose risks to human power grids. Such storms also caused the auroras that appeared in the skies above the United States earlier this month.\n\nFor the researchers, the study represents an achievement decades in the making.\n\n\"Geoff Vasil and I have been thinking about these ideas ever since we were both grad students at CU Boulder 20 years ago,\" Brown said.\n\nWild yet orderly\n\nIn general, scientists agree that the solar dynamo begins in the sun's \"convection zone,\" or roughly the outer one-third of its interior. There, plumes of hot and charged particles, known as plasma, climb toward the surface.\n\nWhile Earth's magnetic field is mostly uniform, the churn of plasma throughout the sun's convection zone warps and twists its magnetic field lines into a pattern that looks a like a bowl of noodles.\n\nDespite that chaos, the solar dynamo powers behavior that is surprisingly predictable, Brown said. Every 11 years or so, the sun moves from a period of low activity, when sunspots pop up less often, to a period of frenzied activity, when sunspots abound -- then it flips and starts all over again. Right now, the sun's activity is on the frenzied side.\n\n\"You could practically set a calendar to the solar dynamo,\" he said. \"How is it so wild yet also so orderly?\"\n\nSpinning dancers\n\nTo find out, researchers first need to know exactly where in the sun the dynamo begins. In the 1990s, scientists proposed that the dynamo emerged roughly 130,000 miles below the sun's surface -- a theory nicknamed the \"dynamo in the deep.\"\n\nThat notion, however, struggles to explain the order that emerges from the sun's chaos. Instead, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues turned to a phenomenon in physics called a \"magnetorotational instability.\" It's a sort of imbalance that forms whenever magnetic fields interact with rotating plasmas where those flows move faster as you go deeper.\n\n\"It's kind of like dance partners slinging each other around in a spin while holding arms,\" Brown said.\n\nResearchers have long examined how this phenomenon arises in the disks of hot gases that circle black holes. Its role in the sun is less clear.\n\nIn the current study, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues ran a series of calculations on computers to study how such an instability could influence the sun's activity. They discovered that the process could easily whip up the sun's insides to form the solar dynamo and explain how the 11-year cycles start. Those physics would also take place in the outer 10% of the sun, or a paltry 20,000 miles from the surface. The solar dynamo, in other words, might be powerful, but it's also a little on the shallow side.\n\nThe researchers have a lot of work to do before they can fully cast off the dynamo in the deep theory. But Brown is hopeful that the study could become its own dynamo -- generating a wave of new research in the field.\n\nVasil added that the work is a testament to his colleague and friend, Julien.\n\nAs a doctoral student at CU Boulder, \"My advisors and mentors were Nic Brummell, Juri Toomre and Keith Julien,\" Vasil said. \"I recall first having a 'huh, that's funny' moment about sun's the near-surface instability one morning in 2004 while flipping through an astrophysics textbook. Keith was the first person I literally ran to tell about it. He was such a fantastic friend all these years. He supported ideas and gave encouragement to a generation of energetic young researchers, like I was back then. It's astonishing he won't be here anymore. But he was thrilled this work happened and was to be published in Nature. The silver lining is that his ideas and personality will live on in the astonishing number of people that he inspired over the years.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Because the Sun's poorly understood activity cycles are somehow linked to its magnetic field - and knowing where the dynamo resides is key to figuring out what drives the solar cycles.\n\n\"Understanding the origin of the Sun's magnetic field has been an open question since Galileo and is important for predicting future solar activity, like flares that could hit the Earth,\" says applied mathematician Daniel Lecoanet of Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\n\"This work proposes a new hypothesis for how the Sun's magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity.\"\n\nThe solar magnetic field is extremely messy and dynamic, and scientists have long sought a detailed understanding of what generates it.\n\nWe know that Earth's magnetic field is generated by a dynamo in its outer core: convecting, rotating, electrically conducting fluid that converts kinetic energy into electric and magnetic fields extending far out into space.\n\nThe internal workings of the Sun are a lot more complicated and difficult to observe than those of a planet on which we live, but they have a big impact.\n\nThe Sun's magnetic activity is linked to its sunspot, flare, and coronal mass ejection activity. This drives the space weather that can have a noticeable, and potentially dangerous, impact on Earth.\n\nThis activity ebbs and flows in cycles of roughly 11 years. At solar maximum, when the Sun is at its most active, with rampant sunspots and flares, its magnetic poles reverse their polarity. There are other ways the Sun's behavior changes, too.\n\nOne of those is torsional oscillations. Because the Sun isn't solid, but fluid, it doesn't globally rotate at the same rate. Torsional oscillations are subsurface changes in the Sun's rotation at certain latitudes, and they are tightly correlated with the sunspot cycle.\n\n\"Because the wave has the same period as the magnetic cycle, it has been thought that these phenomena were linked,\" Lecoanet explains.\n\n\"However, the traditional 'deep theory' of the solar magnetic field does not explain where these torsional oscillations come from. An intriguing clue is that the torsional oscillations are only near the surface of the Sun.\n\n\"Our hypothesis,\" Lecoanet continues, \"is that the magnetic cycle and the torsional oscillations are different manifestations of the same physical process.\"\n\nA deep dynamo, according to theory, should be buried more than 200,000 kilometers (124,000 miles) below the solar surface, at the bottom of the convection zone. But this model also generates features we haven't observed on the Sun, like strong magnetic fields at high latitudes, and fails to explain others, like the way sunspots follow the Sun's magnetic activity.\n\nVasil and his colleagues conducted state-of-the-art numerical simulations based on real data of surface manifestations of acoustic waves inside the Sun, and found that the real behavior of the Sun most closely matches a dynamo that roils not far from the solar surface, in what is known as the near-surface shear layer.\n\nThis shallow dynamo not only produced a Sun that behaves the way ours does, but has closely linked torsional oscillations and sunspot activity too. It's a break from conventional thinking, but other recent studies suggest that we need to start looking at new solutions to solar mysteries, since convention is failing to cut it.\n\n\"I think this result may be controversial,\" says applied mathematician Keaton Burns of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who co-authored the study.\n\n\"Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the Sun. Now we're showing there's a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.\"", "source": {"uri": "sciencealert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScienceAlert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_starr@sciencealert.com", "name": "Michelle Starr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solar flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(mechanics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torsion (mechanics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galileo Galilei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_outer_core", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth's outer core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stellar magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar maximum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical resistivity and conductivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kinetic energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronal mass ejection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses,_Occultations_and_Transits", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Eclipses, Occultations and Transits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/solar-magnetic-field.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

(Credit: Public domain image via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nIt's a pursuit that, in many ways, started with the famed astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1612 A.D.\n\n\"Galileo first observed the sunspots 400 years ago, and he learned quite a bit about them, including how they move over the sun's surface,\" said Brown, a co-author of the research and associate professor in the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences. \"But he couldn't figure out where they came from. We've struggled with the question ever since.\"\n\nThe researchers, led by Geoffrey Vasil of the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, published their findings May 22 in the journal Nature. Co-authors of the study included Keith Julien, an applied mathematician from CU Boulder who died in April after a short illness.\n\nThe findings hinge on the dynamo, the term for the complex physics and chemistry in the sun that produce ita wild magnetic fields. Earth boasts its own dynamo that powers the planet's magnetic field-the reason why all compasses on the ground point north.\n\nThe sun's inner workings matter a lot for people, Brown said. The sun's dynamo generates solar storms that, among other things, pose risks to human power grids. Such storms also caused the recent auroras that appeared in the skies above the United States earlier this month.\n\nFor the researchers, the study represents an achievement decades in the making.\n\n\"Geoff Vasil and I have been thinking about these ideas ever since we were both grad students at CU Boulder 20 years ago,\" Brown said.\n\nWild yet orderly\n\nIn general, scientists agree that the solar dynamo begins in the sun's \"convection zone,\" or roughly the outer one-third of its interior. There, plumes of hot and charged particles, known as plasma, climb toward the surface.\n\nWhile Earth's magnetic field is mostly uniform, the churn of plasma throughout the sun's convection zone warps and twists its magnetic field lines into a pattern that looks a like a bowl of noodles.\n\nDespite that chaos, the solar dynamo powers behavior that is surprisingly predictable, Brown said. Every 11 years or so, the sun moves from a period of low activity, when sunspots pop up less often, to a period of frenzied activity, when sunspots abound-then it flips and starts all over again. Right now, the sun's activity is on the frenzied side.\n\n\"You could practically set a calendar to the solar dynamo,\" he said. \"How is it so wild yet also so orderly?\"\n\nSpinning dancers\n\nTo find out, researchers first need to know exactly where in the sun the dynamo begins. In the 1990s, scientists proposed that the dynamo emerged roughly 130,000 miles below the sun's surface-a theory nicknamed the \"dynamo in the deep.\"\n\nThat notion, however, struggles to explain the order that emerges from the sun's chaos. Instead, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues turned to a phenomenon in physics called a \"magnetorotational instability.\" It's a sort of imbalance that forms whenever magnetic fields interact with rotating plasmas where those flows move faster as you go deeper.\n\n\"It's kind of like dance partners slinging each other around in a spin while holding arms,\" Brown said.\n\nKeith Julien\n\nResearchers have long examined how this phenomenon arises in the disks of hot gases that circle black holes. Its role in the sun is less clear.\n\nIn the current study, Vasil, Brown and their colleagues ran a series of calculations on computers to study how such an instability could influence the sun's activity. They discovered that the process could easily whip up the sun's insides to form the solar dynamo and explain how the 11-year cycles start. Those physics would also take place in the outer 10% of the sun, or a paltry 20,000 miles from the surface. The solar dynamo, in other words, might be powerful, but it's also a little on the shallow side.\n\nThe researchers have a lot of work to do before they can fully cast off the dynamo in the deep theory. But Brown is hopeful that the study could become its own dynamo-generating a wave of new research in the field.\n\nVasil added that the work is a testament to his colleague and friend, Julien.\n\nAs a doctoral student at CU Boulder, \"My advisors and mentors were Nic Brummell, Juri Toomre and Keith Julien,\" Vasil said. \"I recall first having a 'huh, that's funny' moment about sun's the near-surface instability one morning in 2004 while flipping through an astrophysics textbook. Keith was the first person I literally ran to tell about it. He was such a fantastic friend all these years. He supported ideas and gave encouragement to a generation of energetic young researchers, like I was back then. It's astonishing he won't be here anymore. But he was thrilled this work happened and was to be published in Nature. The silver lining is that his ideas and personality will live on in the astonishing number of people that he inspired over the years.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Astrophysicists had suspected that the Sun's powerful magnetic field, which has a huge impact on communications, navigation, and other electronics on and around Earth, was produced by motion much deeper in the star (similar to the way Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of our planet's metallic core). Armed with a better understanding of where the Sun's magnetic field comes from, physicists may soon stand a better chance of predicting how much activity each 11-year solar cycle holds in store.\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh mathematician Geoffrey Vasil and his colleagues published their work in the journal Nature.\n\nVasil and his colleagues used a computer simulation to model how plasma flows in the outer layers of the Sun, called the convective zone: a 124,000-mile-deep sea of roiling plasma, heated from below by the Sun's thermonuclear core. Specifically, they were interested in what happened in the top 20,000 miles or so of the plasma.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology mathematician Keaton Burns, a coauthor on the study, designed the program, called the Dedalus Project, to be very good at simulating how fluids flow, from the movements of liquid inside a cell to the circulation of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. And the Sun, although we tend to picture it as a big ball of fire, is actually a big ball of super-hot gas.\n\nPhysicists know that the magnetic field is driven by an enormous dynamo: physical mass in motion, whose mechanical energy becomes electrical energy.\n\n\"One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there's a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,\" explains Burns in a recent statement.\n\nMost astrophysicists are convinced that process happens more than 125,000 miles deep inside the Sun, at the very bottom of the convection layer. That explanation makes sense in a lot of ways, but simulations based on it don't actually produce results that look much like the churning, roiling plumes of plasma in the Sun's outer layers -- or the pattern of sunspots (dark, relatively cool patches of the Sun's surface, where magnetic field lines meet and tangle) that astronomers actually see on the Sun's surface. The real Sun is much more turbulent than most simulations suggest. And in simulations of a magnetic field coming from deep within the Sun, sunspots tend to gather near the Sun's poles; on the real Sun, most sunspots form near the equator.\n\nKnowing more about how the Sun's magnetic field works could help scientists make predictions about the kinds of solar activity that produced stunning auroras -- and briefly stalled spring planting on some farms by disrupting navigation systems on tractors and other equipment -- earlier in May.\n\nVasil and his colleagues' simulations showed that the Sun's outermost reaches are made of layers of plasma, which normally rotate past each other (picture an onion; now picture an onion 865,000 miles wide and made of super-hot gas with a giant thermonuclear reactor running at its center). But tiny changes in how one layer flowed past the next -- like a little plume or a slight eddy -- could create an instability that fed on itself and rapidly grew into major turbulence.\n\n\"It doesn't take much to trigger an instability! If a system is unstable, it is like a pencil balanced on its point -- any slight breeze is enough to knock it over,\" Lecoanet tells Inverse. \"The outer part of the Sun is convective, which is kind of like it is boiling. These roiling motions are definitely enough to seed the instability.\"\n\nMost of the instabilities that eventually formed got their start thanks to powerful winds in the interior of the Sun, which move at different speeds depending on how deep into the Sun you go. As you sink deeper into the Sun, the winds get stronger -- until about 21,000 miles below the outer edge, when they suddenly slow down.\n\n\"The difference in wind speed at the surface vs. deeper into the Sun is a source of energy that can drive instability,\" says Lecoanet. That energy is eventually converted into the Sun's magnetic field.\n\nAnd in Vasil and his colleagues' simulations, those instabilities in the outer layers of the simulated Sun eventually produced a pattern of magnetic field lines and sunspots that looked remarkably like the real thing.\n\n\"Our work provides strong evidence that the solar cycle starts near the surface of the Sun in the equatorial region,\" says Lecoanet.\n\nEventually, Vasil and his colleagues hope their work will help astrophysicists forecast how active the next solar cycle will be, similar to the way that meteorologists predict how active the coming hurricane season will be.\n\n\"This work is not trying to make predictions about individual solar storms,\" says Lecoanet.\n\nAt the moment, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center can predict the severity of a solar storm a few days in advance, around the time a huge belch of plasma called a coronal mass ejection leaves the Sun's surface. But we don't have a good way to predict what the next few years hold; some solar cycles are more active than others, and knowing what's coming could help us prepare.\n\n\"We want to forecast if the next solar cycle will be particularly strong, or maybe weaker than normal,\" says Lecoanet. \"The previous models (assuming the solar magnetic field is generated deep within the Sun) have not been able to make accurate forecasts of if the next solar cycle will be strong or weak. We are hoping to make predictions of if a cycle will have a lot of solar storms or not a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasma (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mathematician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convection zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geomagnetic storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/5/21/89c5cbd3/in-space-june-7.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

For example, it changes the temperature of Earth's upper atmosphere and affects the behaviour of space-borne instruments, such as communications satellites. This cycle is related to the Sun's magnetic field, but despite decades of observational and theoretical progress, a consistent explanation for many aspects of solar magnetism's most basic features remains elusive. Writing in Nature, Vasil et al. add a provocative ingredient to the theoretical mix that could prove key to unravelling this astrophysical enigma.\n\nA brief description of the solar cycle is in order. The Sun's magnetic field is similar in some ways to Earth's magnetic field, which is a giant dipole that is oriented roughly along its axis of rotation. But the Sun's field is skewed, so that the lines have a 'toroidal' component, which runs parallel to the Sun's equator (Fig. 1). Dark spots are visible where the toroidal lines emerge from the surface and the concentration of these sunspots changes gradually over a period of 11 years, as the toroidal component migrates from mid to equatorial latitudes. This cycle coincides with a reversal of the polarity of the Sun's magnetic field.\n\nThe field's 'poloidal' component runs parallel to lines of constant longitude, and its reversal lags the changes in the toroidal component by a quarter of a cycle. The magnetic helicity, which measures the magnitude and direction of field-line twist, is positive in the Sun's southern hemisphere and negative in its northern hemisphere.\n\nIt is widely accepted that this cycle of magnetic activity is sustained by flows in the solar interior and at the surface, which form a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo (a kind of generator that uses energy from the movement of an electrically conducting fluid to form and maintain a magnetic field). Because the electrical conductivity is very high in the Sun's interior, the gas dictates the shape of the field almost everywhere, and the fluid flow amplifies the field by stretching it.\n\nOne example of this flow-induced field amplification is a mechanism called the Zeldovich dynamo. Imagine that the magnetic field takes the shape of an elastic band. The surrounding fluid stretches and twists the loop until it resembles a figure of eight, which is then folded to form two loops. When these loops merge (again, through flow-induced effects), the resulting field has the same extent as the original field, but twice its strength. The field, in turn, influences the fluid flow: curved field lines exert a tension force, which induces a flow that makes the field lines shorten or straighten. This back reaction of the field on the flow results in dynamos being inherently constrained in terms of the strength of the field.\n\nThree types of flow occur inside the Sun, all of which can be probed with the tools of helioseismology. The first is thermal convection, which transports heat to the surface from a layer in the interior known as the thermal convection zone, much as a liquid heated from below is driven to boil. This convection occurs in discrete 'cells', and the Sun's rotation imparts a twist to these cells as they rise and fall, similarly to how cyclones form on Earth where there are strong currents of rising air. The second occurs because the rotation rate varies with depth and latitude -- this type of flow is known as differential rotation, and it is universally seen in liquids and gases in rotating bodies. The third type is poloidal, or meridional, circulation, in which fluid moves at the surface from the equator towards the poles.\n\nEarly models of the solar cycle were based on a mechanism known as a dynamo loop, in which the toroidal field was generated from the poloidal field through stretching caused by differential rotation, and the poloidal field was produced from the toroidal field through effects caused by turbulent convection. Subsequent models incorporated three more ingredients: the tachocline, a layer of gas that is subject to strong shear forces at the base of the thermal convection zone; the transport of magnetic flux by meridional circulation; and another layer known as the near-surface shear layer -- although its importance has been largely discounted.\n\nAt the same time, advances in computing made it possible to perform simulations of convective, differentially rotating, magnetized shells in the hope of replicating the solar cycle. However, no model -- be it numerical or a stripped-down theoretical one -- has yet explained the length or amplitude of the solar cycle without a fine-tuning of parameters. And if future simulations succeed in capturing cycles with the observed features, it would still be necessary to understand the mechanisms at play to apply the model to other stars, and to understand the Sun's behaviour over long timescales.\n\nThere is one kinematic feature that has not yet been mentioned: the solar cycle is linked to fluctuations in the rate at which the surface rotates, and these are known as torsional oscillations. Although a relationship between the torsional oscillations and the solar magnetic field has been discussed before, no model has yet made the connection that Vasil et al. now propose -- namely, that both are manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon, known as the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which arises when an electrically conducting fluid in a magnetic field spins faster near its centre of rotation than it does farther away.\n\nThe MRI is generally considered to be the main mechanism through which compact objects, such as black holes, accrete matter from a rapidly rotating disc: the instability transports angular momentum outwards, allowing matter to move inwards. This occurs because the magnetic field associated with the object generates tension that makes fluid displaced inwards continue to fall towards the object. Turbulence arising from the MRI has also been shown to amplify magnetic fields, thereby making the MRI a dynamo. This provides a natural way of limiting the amplitude of the instability: if the field is sufficiently strong, magnetic tension becomes the dominant force and it reins in amplification of the field. This exemplifies the interplay between fluid flow and curved field lines.\n\nVasil et al. show, through simplified analysis and numerical simulations, that an initially poloidal magnetic field in the near-surface shear layer can be amplified by the MRI. The radial shear forces that are produced by the MRI generate a toroidal field, accompanied by rotational velocity fluctuations, which the authors identify as the torsional oscillations. Importantly, their picture is consistent with the magnetic helicity being positive in the Sun's southern hemisphere and negative in its northern hemisphere. They also find that the rate at which the instability grows is comparable to the period of the solar cycle, offering a tantalizing clue to the otherwise obscure timing of the cycle. And the instability has a natural way of saturating -- by enhancing the magnetic field and by modifying the structure of the near-surface shear layer so as to stabilize it.\n\nThe authors' model is highly simplified, especially in its treatment of thermal convection, and the existence of the near-surface shear layer is not explained. However, Vasil and colleagues' initial results are intriguing. They could well furnish an interpretative framework for more-elaborate models, and they are sure to inspire future studies.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dynamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_(heat_transfer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Convection (heat transfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fluid dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical resistivity and conductivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Differential rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellar magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetohydrodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotation around a fixed axis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dipole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Thermodynamics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Thermodynamics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Classical_Mechanics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Classical Mechanics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Magnetic_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Magnetic Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01357-1/d41586-024-01357-1_27098484.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590231", "eventUri": "eng-9590231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

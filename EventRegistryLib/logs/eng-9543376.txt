On what became a glorious, balmy evening the team comprehensively outclassed PEC Zwolle.\n\nArne Slot, overseeing his 100th league game in charge, watched from the touchline and his son, Joep, who for the best part of three years had dreamed of being allowed into the noisiest part of the ground, stood among the ultras in the Gerard Meijer Tribune.\n\nIn the 82nd minute, the entire ground sung his father's name and, just as Slot lifted his hands above his head to return their applause, Santiago Gim\u00e9nez scored the final goal in a 5-0 win. When the final whistle blew, and Slot walked towards the fans to bid farewell, the PA eschewed the ear-splitting techno that had soundtracked the rest of the night and played You'll Never Walk Alone. Football rarely permits moments of such infinite perfection.\n\n\"It's not a normal situation for a manager that the fans are singing your name, let alone that they do it in such a way, with the whole stadium singing,\" Slot said later. \"Normally it happens when a manager loses one or two games, and the whole stadium stands up to sing different songs.\"\n\nWhen Feyenoord host Excelsior on Sunday week, much of the Gerard Meijer Tribune will be closed in punishment for the fans' use of flares in the KNVB Cup semi-final win over Groningen. For many of the club's hard-core supporters, this was goodbye. \"I've never seen Feyenoord play like this. I really mean it,\" said Paul van Dijk, a season-ticket holder in that end for the last 15 years.\n\n\"Players come and go, managers come and go. This is modern football, isn't it? But this is one manager we're very sad to see go. We're sad, but proud. We're proud to say he's earned it at Feyenoord, but also sad that we need to kind of start again. I told my friends that we were living a dream with him, and now the dream is coming to an end.\"\n\nIn his first season in Rotterdam, Slot took Feyenoord to third place in the league and the Europa Conference League final. In his second they won the Eredivisie title for just the second time this century, and in his third he has won the KNVB Cup, with his team on track to exceed last season's points total and beaten to a second title only by a freakishly successful PSV Eindhoven.\n\nNow he is leaving for Liverpool, but as Slot conducted the fans' roars after the final whistle it was hard to tell if this was an ideal moment to depart, or a ludicrous one.\n\n\"Yes, that's a different judgment to make every time,\" Slot said. \"Last season the fans were quite similar to what they are now. Then it felt like things are not done here yet; I wanted to go for one extra year, or maybe even longer. But then sometimes in life opportunities come along and you have to ask yourself the question: 'Will I continue this journey at this club, or is this a good moment to leave?' And I've made that choice.\"\n\nIt is only four months since Slot told an interviewer: \"I have no reason to think my future will be anywhere else\" and that \"I could become a kind of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Feyenoord\". Instead, he will attempt to be a kind of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in acclaim if not in method.\n\nThough the scenes after the final whistle felt distinctly Kloppian, it was unusual behaviour from someone who is normally more reserved. Slot is a calm presence on the touchline, spending most of his time either with arms crossed or his hands in his pockets, rarely raising his voice.\n\n\"As a person he's very down to earth, not big shouting and that kind of stuff,\" said Mario Been, who came through the youth system at Feyenoord, spent six seasons in the first team before returning for two as manager, and is now a TV analyst. \"I speak a lot with him, and the way he talks about football, the way he talks in general, I think he's a very amiable man, a man that is very warm for the players. He is a human, he loves to work with people.\n\n\"From nothing he can make something. I know there are a lot of Dutch coaches that didn't succeed in England but I think this man, when you give him the time, he can do something there. From day one he will build the way he wants to play: press high, and everybody has to do that. And he opens the eyes of the players. For example Quinten Timber, last year he was rubbish. Then Arne started talking with him, telling him: 'You have to do more.' Now he's a national team player.\"\n\nIn the last two seasons Feyenoord have raised \u20ac110m through player sales, with more departures expected in the summer. Gim\u00e9nez, who arrived from the Mexican club Cruz Azul for \u20ac6m in 2022, is one of them. \"He's a complete coach because he understands when to tell you that you did well, and when to tell you that you did bad and you need to improve,\" the 23-year-old said of Slot.\n\n\"I think that's a real advantage of Arne, that he can talk with the players really well and he knows what he wants for a team. He will bring intensity in pressing, he will bring a lot of offensive plays. I think Arne loves to attack, and attack makes you strong in defence.\"\n\nOn Sunday Feyenoord's 4-1-3-2 formation became a full-on front five when in possession, with the full-backs often joining in. The centre-back Thomas Beelen - who was very impressive defensively, if less so with his distribution - occasionally carried the ball forward, leaving only two players behind him. \"It was somewhere in the second half that we gave away two chances and that is, I think, typical for us,\" Slot said. \"We don't concede a lot of chances and a lot of counterattacks, despite the fact that we are a very offensive team - we attack with a lot of players. Scoring five goals is not a coincidence.\"\n\nKey for their style of play is the players' fitness: Slot may be a good coach to play for, but clearly he is not an easy one. \"Even in the final minutes of the game it's full press, running all over the pitch,\" said Dennis Kranenburg, a former youth-team player who now commentates on Feyenoord's games for Rijnmond radio. \"The players like the way he communicates with them, he's always very clear. One of them told me: 'When the manager says before a game that this, this and this will happen; this, this and this happens.' Everything he said before is what happened.\n\n\"He's also very clear in his way of talking to the media. He's a clever guy and he knows what he wants to say, and the fans hear it and they love it. That is maybe his strongest point. I think when you ask anybody here in the stadium, 'What do you think of Arne Slot?' everybody will say, 'Give him a statue, or name the stadium after him.'

On what became a glorious, balmy evening the team comprehensively outclassed PEC Zwolle. Arne Slot, overseeing his 100th league game in charge, watched from the touchline and his son, Joep, who for the best part of three years had dreamed of being allowed into the noisiest part of the ground, stood among the ultras in the Gerard Meijer Tribune.\n\nIn the 82nd minute, the entire ground sung his father's name and, just as Slot lifted his hands above his head to return their applause, Santiago Gim\u00e9nez scored the final goal in a 5-0 win. When the final whistle blew, and Slot walked towards the fans to bid farewell, the PA eschewed the ear-splitting techno that had soundtracked the rest of the night and played You'll Never Walk Alone. Football rarely permits moments of such infinite perfection.\n\n\"It's not a normal situation for a manager that the fans are singing your name, let alone that they do it in such a way, with the whole stadium singing,\" Slot said later. \"Normally it happens when a manager loses one or two games, and the whole stadium stands up to sing different songs.\"\n\nWhen Feyenoord host Excelsior on Sunday week, much of the Gerard Meijer Tribune will be closed in punishment for the fans' use of flares in the KNVB Cup semi-final win over Groningen. For many of the club's hardcore supporters, this was goodbye. \"I've never seen Feyenoord play like this. I really mean it,\" said Paul van Dijk, a season-ticket holder in that end for the last 15 years. \"Players come and go, managers come and go. This is modern football, isn't it? But this is one manager we're very sad to see go. We're sad, but proud. We're proud to say he's earned it at Feyenoord, but also sad that we need to kind of start again. I told my friends that we were living a dream with him, and now the dream is coming to an end.\"\n\nIn his first season in Rotterdam, Slot took Feyenoord to third place in the league and the Europa Conference League final. In his second they won the Eredivisie title for just the second time this century, and in his third he has won the KNVB Cup, with his team on track to exceed last season's points total and beaten to a second title only by a freakishly successful PSV Eindhoven. Now he is leaving for Liverpool, but as Slot conducted the fans' roars after the final whistle it was hard to tell if this was an ideal moment to depart, or a ludicrous one.\n\n\"Yes, that's a different judgment to make every time,\" Slot said. \"Last season the fans were quite similar to what they are now. Then it felt like things are not done here yet; I wanted to go for one extra year, or maybe even longer. But then sometimes in life opportunities come along and you have to ask yourself the question: 'Will I continue this journey at this club, or is this a good moment to leave?' And I've made that choice.\"\n\nIt is only four months since Slot told an interviewer: \"I have no reason to think my future will be anywhere else\" and that \"I could become a kind of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Feyenoord\". Instead, he will attempt to be a kind of J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in acclaim if not in method.\n\nThough the scenes after the final whistle felt distinctly Kloppian, it was unusual behaviour from someone who is normally more reserved. Slot is a calm presence on the touchline, spending most of his time either with arms crossed or his hands in his pockets, rarely raising his voice.\n\n\"As a person he's very down to earth, not big shouting and that kind of stuff,\" said Mario Been, who came through the youth system at Feyenoord, spent six seasons in the first team before returning for two as manager, and is now a TV analyst. \"I speak a lot with him, and the way he talks about football, the way he talks in general, I think he's a very amiable man, a man that is very warm for the players. He is a human, he loves to work with people.\n\n\"From nothing he can make something. I know there are a lot of Dutch coaches that didn't succeed in England but I think this man, when you give him the time, he can do something there. From day one he will build the way he wants to play: press high, and everybody has to do that. And he opens the eyes of the players. For example Quinten Timber, last year he was rubbish. Then Arne started talking with him, telling him: 'You have to do more.' Now he's a national team player.\"\n\nIn the last two seasons Feyenoord have raised \u20ac110m through player sales, with more departures expected in the summer. Gim\u00e9nez, who arrived from the Mexican club Cruz Azul for \u20ac6m in 2022, is one of them. \"He's a complete coach because he understands when to tell you that you did well, and when to tell you that you did bad and you need to improve,\" the 23-year-old said of Slot. \"I think that's a real advantage of Arne, that he can talk with the players really well and he knows what he wants for a team. He will bring intensity in pressing, he will bring a lot of offensive plays. I think Arne loves to attack, and attack makes you strong in defence.\"\n\nOn Sunday Feyenoord's 4-1-3-2 formation became a full-on front five when in possession, with the full-backs often joining in. The centre-back Thomas Beelen - who was very impressive defensively, if less so with his distribution - occasionally carried the ball forward, leaving only two players behind him. \"It was somewhere in the second half that we gave away two chances and that is, I think, typical for us,\" Slot said. \"We don't concede a lot of chances and a lot of counterattacks, despite the fact that we are a very offensive team - we attack with a lot of players. Scoring five goals is not a coincidence.\"\n\nKey for their style of play is the players' fitness: Slot may be a good coach to play for, but clearly he is not an easy one. \"Even in the final minutes of the game it's full press, running all over the pitch,\" said Dennis Kranenburg, a former youth-team player who now commentates on Feyenoord's games for Rijnmond radio. \"The players like the way he communicates with them, he's always very clear. One of them told me: 'When the manager says before a game that this, this and this will happen; this, this and this happens.' Everything he said before is what happened.\n\n\"He's also very clear in his way of talking to the media. He's a clever guy and he knows what he wants to say, and the fans hear it and they love it. That is maybe his strongest point. I think when you ask anybody here in the stadium, 'What do you think of Arne Slot?' everybody will say, 'Give him a statue, or name the stadium after him.' Yeah, he is very popular here.\"\n\nIf Sunday played out like a dream, it must have come as little surprise to a group of fans who have spent three years living one. In Liverpool another manager, despite also narrowly failing to win the league, will soon take his fans' applause for the final time.

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! podcast\n\nThis could be Rotterdam or anywhere. After a weekend immersed with seasoned Feyenoord observers in this sun-kissed port city observing Arne Slot up close at De Kuip, it is clear his methods can be adaptable for the seismic step-up he faces in Liverpool. Or Rome.\n\nIt is a view shared by Dutch football legend Marco van Basten, who said on Slot: 'If you get AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord to play (good) football, you will also get big clubs to play (good) football. I think it will only be easier for him (at Liverpool) because you have better players.'\n\nAs far as references go, Van Basten is a strong start. The man he is poised to replace in the Anfield hotseat, Jurgen Klopp, is not bad either. The German has publicly endorsed Slot, labelling him a 'good coach and good guy'.\n\nGlowing reviews continue from all corners of the footballing world but perhaps better placed is star man Santi Gimenez, the 26-goal striker who is one of many success stories of Slot's time here after being plucked from the Mexican league. Big clubs in Europe are keeping tabs.\n\nMail Sport asked what makes his manager so special and Gimenez replied: 'It was a big step (for me) to come from Mexico to the Netherlands and he gave me confidence. He always pushed me to be better. I am really grateful to Arne, I hope he can do well everywhere.\n\nArne Slot is poised to replace Jurgen Klopp in the Liverpool hotseat at the end of the season\n\nSlot has received glowing references include the man he is expected to replace in Klopp\n\nStudying Slot at Feyenoord, it is clear his methods can be adaptable for the seismic step-up he is set to face\n\nPodcast All episodes EPISODE 84: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

He understands when to tell you that you did well, and also when to tell you if you did bad. That is a big advantage of Arne, he can talk really well with the players. Arne's style is attack, attack, attack.'\n\nThe Argentine speaks good English but could not help himself accidentally slipping into the past tense when talking about Slot's tenure. 'He deserves the world, he made wonderful memories,' he added. 'We are happy he was - well, is - our coach.'\n\nJudging by the full-time scenes at De Kuip after Sunday's 5-0 thrashing of PEC Zwolle, he will not be their coach for much longer. He greeted ultras in the Gerard Meijer Tribune in a style that was reminiscent of Klopp's customary fist bumps to the Kop.\n\nSlot was pushed towards the stand, which is named after a former club masseur voted as the 'greatest Feyenoorder' following 45 years of service, and then conducted them into chants as fans fell silent and invited their beloved coach to lead the songs.\n\nBefore that, the soundtrack to the night was supporters chanting 'stand up for Arne Slot' - in which the whole stadium took a temporary seat then sprang to their feet to dance - and a rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone, plus tunes about the backroom staff also departing.\n\nIt felt like a goodbye - and it was. Parts of De Kuip will be closed for Slot's final home game as punishment for fans' use of fireworks in a game in March. The end game comes against Excelsior, apt noting the team name is latin translation for 'higher', where Slot is heading.\n\n'I agree it looked like a goodbye,' he said. 'They are expecting me to leave. That is something we could say...' He added: 'Sometimes in life opportunities come along. Last year I made the choice to stay, this time probably different.'\n\nSanti Gimenez, the 26-goal striker is one of many success stories of Slot's time in Rotterdam\n\nMail Sport was in attendance to watch Slot's Feyenoord side beat PEC Zwolle 5-0 as he closes in on the exit door of the side he led to the Eredivisie title last season\n\nDutch football legend Marco van Basten believes Slot will find life easier at Liverpool\n\nSigning on the dotted line and an official announcement is all that is missing now - and that could happen in the coming days but might be saved for after the season has finished. Slot emerged as Liverpool's No 1 candidate - but what makes him so special?\n\nLike nearly every manager in Europe, the 45-year-old coach does not hide that his inspiration is Pep Guardiola which, in turn, means he is influenced by the famed Dutch school of football popularised by Rinus Michels, Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal.\n\nOne former colleague of Slot who has known him since his playing days at Sparta Rotterdam, says: 'Everyone knew he would become a trainer, it did not surprise anyone. Not completely the same but Van Gaal also played for Sparta Rotterdam.\n\n'They were both far above the group technically and tactically. Both very slow! With a bit of fantasy you can see comparisons between the two in their journeys. He sees Guardiola as his idol.\n\nSlot does not hide that his inspiration is Pep Guardiola (right) which, in turn, means he is influenced by the Dutch school of football popularised by Michels, Cruyff and Van Gaal\n\n'He is very like Guardiola, they play the same high-intensity, attractive, attacking football. You can compare the two - not in level because Pep already proved everything worldwide and Slot is at the beginning.\n\n'But he loves the way Guardiola works, even in his press conferences - he will never, ever pick out a player individually. He always finds the positive. He's really into analysing opponents for hours and hours.\n\n'The Feyenoord players always say, 'Everything the trainer predicted, we saw in the game'. Players are never surprised. Arne is a workaholic. He's also happy to delegate. He has a coach for this, a coach for that, and for that and that and that!'\n\nSome staff will follow him to Merseyside, including right-hand man Sipke Hulshoff - described as 'an extension of Arne' - plus co-head of performance Ruben Peeters and analyst Etienne Reijnen.\n\nIf Slot had his way, others - like goalkeeper guru Jyri Nieminen, strategy manager and former Greater Manchester Police officer Matt Wade and trainer Leigh Egger - might have also formed the band, but Feyenoord do not fancy too many employees leaving.\n\nPeeters, the Belgian who spent six years at Genk, has worked with Slot on 'microbiome manipulation' - essentially how gut health can improve sporting performance - and DNA epigenetics, which is trying to impact genes by changing behaviours.\n\nSiple Hulshoff (left) is expected to follow Slot (right) among others to Liverpool this summer\n\nSlot's backroom team are also said to closely monitor players' sleeping patterns to optimise performance on matchday. To conclude the biology lesson, the manager credits his performance and medical teams with an abnormally low injury rate.\n\nThe 45-year-old is also huge on making stars feel at home. Player care manager Frank Boer looks after everything from helping new signings buy houses to getting a tilde printed on the name of forward Igor Paixao's shirt to make his Brazilian roots feel honoured.\n\nSlot is credited with sending defender Marcus Pedersen - now out on loan - to kick-boxing classes to develop aggression and confidence. Boer also put Pedersen in touch with a now ex-girlfriend, Noor Omrani, though that might not be in his official job remit.\n\n'It's not fair to all of the others (if I get credit),' Slot said. 'They are all very important. You know how it is in football, it is all about the head coach. But my complete staff deserve lots of credit for how we have performed.'\n\nBorn in the tiny village of Bergentheim, a small drive from the German border, young Slot became obsessed with football after watching his father Arend - a head-master - teach the sport to kids at an amateur level. He watches basketball, is a keen golfer and plays padel.\n\nHe had a relatively low-key playing career compared to his idol Guardiola but was still dubbed the 'Bergentheimer Xavi' by the Dutch media. Slot was a slow midfielder but made up for it with an astute technical approach.\n\n'I first met Arne when I was 18 or 19 playing together at NAC Breda, he took me under his wing,' says former team-mate Julian Jenner. 'I would compare him to Sergio Busquets, the same mobility and technique. Whatever came into his mind, he could do.\n\nSlot (left) had a low-key playing career but was dubbed the 'Bergentheimer Xavi'\n\n'When he was in the line-up, he would speak up, when he was not playing, he would try to help the young boys. He would say to the coach, 'Yeah but what if this happens?' The coach would say, 'Arne, you're the creative one, you have to fix it!'. He wrote everything down.\n\n'He spoke a lot with Marijn Beuker, now at Ajax, about personal development, trying to expose his shortcomings to work out what he needed to improve. His ambitions sky-rocketed. He is more like Guardiola than Klopp, total dominance but more direct.\n\n'I come from the opposite side of the country, The Hague, we are chest out and say we are the best. He is more from the realistic side, don't go too fast. As a person, he is easy-going, polite, if you don't feel good then he is there for you and shows his father side.\n\n'Arne has to convince big players to believe in his philosophy - like Mohamed Salah who is from a different level - but I have no doubt he will prove himself. The fans will love him, his dominant playing style and pressing can get them behind him. With that Liverpool can be unstoppable.'\n\nSlot's first venture after hanging up his boots was to co-found a company called Slotwear with his brother Jakko - who now works in athletics - which made bespoke and customisable captain's armbands.\n\nThere are pictures of the brothers but it is tough to tell them apart - Jakko, also bald, gets mistaken for his brother and stopped for selfies, to which he plays along. The pair used to be managerial partners when both coaching FC Bergentheim's youth team from the age of just 14.\n\nBut it was Arne whose vocation was in coaching and one of the first men to give him a break, Henk de Jong, took a trip to Liverpool last week by a quirk of coincidence. De Jong hired Slot as an assistant at Cambuur.\n\nThe 59-year-old is still in post at the second-tier club but going through an illness - a cyst in the head - and was invited to Liverpool by Klopp. 'I heard that you are the only coach in the world who is funnier than me,' joked the German in a video message. 'How come we've never met?'\n\nDe Jong, who also visited Erik ten Hag at Manchester United, returned the humour by telling Liverpool staffers that Slot is his apprentice. Pep Lijnders, a friend of Slot's, showed him around. De Jong texted Slot a picture of him in the press conference room, saying: 'I'm in your seat.'\n\nHenk de Jong (pictured) was one of the first men to give Slot his break and joked on a trip to Liverpool that the Feyenoord boss is his apprentice\n\nWhen the curtain closes on his time at Feyenoord, Slot will take a brief break - he enjoyed a holiday to Italy last week - and then analyse all of Liverpool's games. He caught the first few minutes of Sunday's win but had to refocus.\n\nRotterdam-based sources tell how Slot has been known to stay 'up all night' studying opponents to find weaknesses. He will cut footage of his own team in bad moments - such as poor misses or a defender falling over - to not dampen confidence.\n\nSlot is far from perfect and there have been bumps in the road, not least a fallout with former club AZ Alkmaar which saw him fired for flirting with Feyenoord. 'Your departure was very painful in Alkmaar,' said Brian Wijker, an AZ-facing columnist.\n\n'Especially the way. As if your girlfriend leaves you after she has been sharing a bed with someone else for a number of weeks.' Before he departed, Alkmaar were level on points with Ajax atop the Eredivisie before the season was curtailed due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nSlot will have big boots to fill at Liverpool when he takes over from Klopp this summer\n\nBut akin to Klopp taking Liverpool from mid-table mediocrity back to glory again, Slot has returned cash-strapped Feyenoord to their rightful home of a Dutch superpower after a decade of turmoil. Fans outside Cafe Hollywood, a vibrant bar in the shadows of De Kuip, idolise him.\n\n'You're here to take Slot!' accuses the first fan, upon detecting an English accent. Another, aptly named Paul van Dijk, says: 'In the last years he has worked wonders with Feyenoord. He has taken a dead team, nothing special, to the Conference League final, the League and Cup.'\n\nThe sentiment is shared and more fans add: 'He teaches players how to become a lot better, I don't know any other who can do that. He is a trainer who is human. We are sad to see him leave but also proud and happy for him. He's the manager who gave us everything we wanted.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Dr. Itai Pessach at Sheba Hospital, where the freed captives were being treated, said none had serious physical injuries and it would likely be days before they could be discharged. They have lost friends and family, and staff \u201chave been assisting them in rebuilding the infrastructure of their life,\u201d he told reporters. About 120 hostages remain, with 43 pronounced dead, after about half were released in a weeklong ceasefire in November. Israeli troops have recovered the bodies of at least 16, according to the government. Survivors include about 15 women, two children under 5 and two men in their 80s. But Hagari on Saturday acknowledged the military can\u2019t carry out operations to rescue everyone. The latest rescue has lifted spirits in Israel as divisions deepen over the best way to bring hostages home. Many Israelis urge Netanyahu to embrace a cease-fire deal U.S. President Joe Biden announced last month, but far-right allies threaten to collapse his government if he does. Hours after the rescue, thousands of Israelis again gathered to protest the government and call for a deal.", "summary": "In Gaza, medics described scenes of chaos after the raid. \"Kids completely grey or white from the shock, burnt, screaming for their parents.\"", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/world/gazas-health-ministry-says-274-palestinians-were-killed-in-israeli-raid-that-rescued-4-hostages", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/topshot-palestinian-israel-conflict-1.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:17:09", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.208}

Bonnie Lou Gower was only a teenager in 1989 when she exchanged vows with Evonitz, who was the sibling of her schoolmate and eight years her senior, as she relayed to her TikTok followers through a series of videos recounting her deceptive marriage. Their eight-year union was littered with chilling signs, from Evonitz denying Gower the chance to go to university to his panicked enquiry about whether she would flee the country with him - a question he suspiciously put forth around the time several girls in their community were found dead.

Now he might be released early' \"Looking back at that, that seems kind of crazy but at the time I thought he was just stressed out about work, because it was a huge transition for him to get out of the military and move to Virginia and start a new life and try to get a job,\" mentioned Gower in one of her clips, adding that she plans to turn her nightmarish experience into a published book. She added that by that stage, the two had been wedded for numerous years. Tensions were high from the beginning with Evonitz, but Gower remained in the marital bond due to the commitment she believed she made. Although she didn't recall any episodes of physical assault, she claimed that her spouse, a convicted mass murderer, confined her to their family home, expressed disapproval of her pursuing education or employment, making new friends, and even exerted control over her body weight. Gower remembered, \"He really limited the amount of money I was allowed to spend on phone calls to my family,\" She added, \"Not having a lot of friends or anybody who I could talk to about my relationship - I really didn't know how different it was from the average marriage, and I really didn't have anybody to bounce things off of and find out what it was normal, which I think was probably exactly what he wanted,\" as she revealed in her TikTok videos. In 1996, the couple relocated to Spotsylvania, Virginia, after living in San Diego and South Carolina. It was here that Evonitz kidnapped and murdered 16-year-old Sofia Marlene Silva.

Seven months on, Evonitz struck again, this time kidnapping and murdering Kristin Michelle \"Kristi\" Lisk, 15, and Kathryn Nicole \"Kati\" Lisk, 12, right from their front lawn. He sexually assaulted and strangled both girls before discarding their bodies in a river. Around this period, Gower noticed that Evonitz began experiencing \"a lot of mood switches\". One day, he came home in a panic, asking if Gower would be willing to flee the country with him. \"I was like, 'What do you mean? What the hell? Why would you ask me that? '\" Gower recollected. Pretending he'd had a rough day at work, Evonitz convinced his wife he was committed to being with her through thick and thin, a reassurance she gladly accepted. The complete narrative is yet to be shared by Gower in her ongoing series, but she reveals that before his reign of terror ended in 2002, they divorced and she remarried. It was in 2002 that he kidnapped 15-year-old Kara Robinson from her South Carolina home at gunpoint - taking her to his flat, where she escaped while he slept. Knowing law enforcement was on his tail, Evonitz fled. In a chilling confession to his sister, he admitted committing \"more crimes than he can remember\" before he killed himself in Florida. While it's unconfirmed, authorities suspect Evonitz may also have been involved in other criminal activities - including at least one other killing - predating his marriage to Gower. \"It's taken a lot of time. It's been 22 years, and I have to say that at this point I'm doing pretty well with it. It definitely has its moments where it comes out and in my current relationship and, or in my relationships over the last several years, and obviously,\" remarked Gower. \"Talk about trust issues.\"", "summary": "Bonnie Lou Gower was just 17 years old in 1989 when she married Richard Evonitz, the brother of her classmate and eight years her senior.

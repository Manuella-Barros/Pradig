Constable Tyler Bell of Peel regional police said there was more than one alleged victim but declined to say how many. \u201cObviously, this is a high-profile case,\u201d Bell said. \u201cOur special victims unit is bound to protect the victims and in doing so that\u2019s why we\u2019re are being vague. \u201cThere is more than one victim but we won\u2019t confirm that number yet.\u201d Bell said they were appealing to members of the public to come forward if they have information or have been victims.

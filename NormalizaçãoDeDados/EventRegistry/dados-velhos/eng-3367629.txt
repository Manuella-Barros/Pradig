You just magnified her.\"\n\nHeyer was killed on Saturday in the wake of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as members of the \"alt-right\" and white supremacist groups gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate statue. Suspect James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist counterprotesters who had assembled to oppose the rally, killing Heyer and injuring several others.\n\nHundreds of mourners gathered at the public memorial service on Wednesday, which was held in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the Paramount Theater. In addition to Bro, the service included speeches by Heyer's family members, colleagues and friends, who shared stories about the Charlottesville paralegal.\n\n\"They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her.\"\n\nWhile Bro paid tribute to her daughter's life and personality, remembering nightly Facebook messages and her talkative personality, Bro's speech emphasized what can be taken from her daughter's death, as she implored Americans to fight for their beliefs and hold difficult dialogues in response to the injustices they see in the world.\n\n\"Remember in your heart: If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,\" Bro said. \"And I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong, don't ignore it, don't look the other way. You make a point to look at it and say to yourself, 'What can I do to make a difference?' And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have my child, but, by golly, if I got to give her up, we're gonna make it count,\" Bro concluded.\n\nHere's Bro's speech in full:\n\nMy child's famous Facebook post was, \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\" She paid attention. She made a lot of us pay attention. Oh my gosh, dinner with her we knew was going to be an ordeal of listening. And conversation, and perhaps disagreement. But it was gonna happen.\n\nAnd so my husband would say, \"OK, I'm going to go out in the car and play my video game for a while.\" And so we'd sit and we'd grill. And she and I would talk. And I would listen. And we would negotiate. And I would listen. And we would talk about all the stuff. We talked about politics, we talked about anything that caught her eye that she felt was fair, unfair. She'd talk about her feelings about the office and how things were going. I mean, she just talked. The girl loved to talk. And she was single, so there was nobody listening at home, so Mama got a lot of it. And that was wonderful.\n\nYou never think you're gonna bury your child, you never think to take those pictures. They asked me for pictures for this, and I struggled. I had pictures from her childhood, but I had to go to Facebook to find pictures of my child, because we were always together. I saw her a couple of times a month at least and we would text each other fairly often, and we would Facebook message at bedtime, \"I love you. You doing OK?\" \"Yep, I love you.\"\n\nSo I have no regrets on that part. Take pictures of the ones that you love because you don't know when they're not going to be there.\n\nBut here's what I want to say to you today: This could be a storm in a teacup and it could all be for nothing. I could have said, \"Let's not do this publicly, let's have a small, private funeral.\" But you know, that's not who Heather was.\n\nAnybody who knew Heather said, \"Yep, this is the way she had to go. Big and large.\" Had to have the world involved, because that's my child. She's just that way. Always has been, and will continue to be.\n\nBecause here's the message: Although Heather was a caring and compassionate person, so are a lot of you. A lot of you go that extra mile. And I think that's the reason that what happened to Heather has struck a chord. Because we know that what she did is achievable. We don't all have to die, we don't all have to sacrifice our lives.\n\nThey tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well guess what? You just magnified her.\n\nSo here's what I want to happen: You ask me, \"what can I do?\" So many caring people, pages and pages and pages of stuff I'm going through, I'm reading pages and pages and pages of how she's touching the world. I want this to spread. I don't want this to die.\n\nThis is just the beginning of Heather's legacy. This is not the end of Heather's legacy. You need to find in your heart that small spark of accountability. What is there that I can do to make the world a better place? What injustice do I see?\n\nAnd you might want to turn away -- \"I don't really want to get involved with that. I don't want to speak up. They'll be annoyed with me. My boss might think less of me.\" -- I don't care. You poke that finger at yourself, like Heather would have done, and you make it happen. You take that extra step. You find a way to make a difference in the world.\n\nMy child had a high school education; my child was no saint. She was hard to raise, because everything was a negotiation -- not kidding -- but you know what? She was a firm believer in whatever she believed. And let's do that. Let's find that spark of conviction, let's find in ourselves that action. Let's spread this. Let's have the uncomfortable dialogue.\n\nIt ain't easy sitting down and saying, \"Well why are you upset?\" It ain't easy sitting down and going, \"Yeah, well I think this way, and I don't agree with you, but I'm gonna respectfully listen to what you have to say.\" We're not going to sit around and shake hands and go \"Kumbaya.\" And I'm sorry, it's not all about forgiveness. I know that's not a popular trend.\n\nBut the truth is: we are gonna have are differences. We are going to be angry with each other. But let's channel that anger not into hate, not into violence, not into fear, but let's channel that difference, that anger, into righteous action.\n\nRight now, down the road, there's a blood drive going on in Heather's name. Right now, there are people who are here willing to listen to one another and talk to one another. Last night in New England, they had a peaceful rally in Heather's name to have some difficult dialogues. If you ever want to see what one of those dialogues looked like, look at her Facebook posts. I'm telling you, they were rough sometimes, but they were dialogues, and the conversations have to happen. That's the only way we're gonna carry Heather's spark through.\n\nSo remember in your heart: If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. And I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong, don't ignore it, don't look the other way. You make a point to look at it and say to yourself, \"What can I do to make a difference?\", and that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile.", "id": "9579289", "details": {}, "date":

Her grandfather, Elwood Shrader, shared touching words: \"She showed her passion at an early age,\" and later added, \"She wanted equality.\"\n\nHeyer's cousin, Diana Ratcliff, read a letter for Heather at the service. And Heyer's mom, Susan Bro, received a standing ovation after delivering an emotional call to action.\n\n\"I think the reason what happened to Heather has struck a chord is because we know what she did is achievable. We don't all have to die. We don't all have to sacrifice our lives. They killed my daughter to try to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her,\" she told the crowd, moving on to explain what she wants now that Heyer is gone.\n\n\"Here's what I want to happen,\" she said. \"I want this to spread. I don't want this to die. This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy. This is not the end of Heather's legacy. You need to find in your heart that small spark of accountability. What is there that I can do to make the world a better place?\" she said, asking everyone to speak out against inequality.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: 9 Male Celebrities Who Are Feminists and Proud\n\n\"You poke that finger at yourself like Heather would have done and you make it happen. You take that extra step. You find a way to make a difference in the world,\" she added.\n\n\"My child had a high school education. My child was no saint. My child was hard to raise because everything was a negotiation, not kidding. But you know what? She was a firm believer in whatever she believed in, so let's do that,\" she continued.\n\n\"Let's find that spark of conviction. Let's find in yourself that action ... Let's have the uncomfortable dialogue.

But let's channel that anger not into hate, not into violence, not into fear, but let's channel that anger into righteous action,\" she urged.\n\nBro relayed the same sentiment at the end of her speech. \"Remember in your heart, if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong, don't ignore it, don't look the other way,\" she said, adding, \"Say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference?\"\n\nHer closing remarks were touching: \"I'd rather have my child but, by golly, if I've gotta give her up, we're gonna make it count.\"", "id": "9579292", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mother of Charlottesville Victim Heather Heyer: \"If You're Not Outraged, You're Not Paying Attention", "image": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/08/081617-heather-heyer-susan-bro-lead.jpg?itok=UjGad-Rx", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "id": "303765", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Education"}, "id": "304279", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"}, {"label": {"eng": "ABC News"}, "id": "304736", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saint"}, "id": "305574", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anger"}, "id": "306302", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}, "id": "316203", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}, "id": "321280", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}, {"label": {"eng": "Standing ovation"}, "id": "345260", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_ovation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kumbaya"}, "id": "392631", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbaya"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "I Want Her"}, "id": "940404", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_Her"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 548, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/New Age", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/New_Age"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam"}], "time": "16:20:00"}

And she was single, so there was nobody to listen at home, so mama got a lot of it. And that was wonderful.\n\nYou never think you're going to bury your child. You never think to take those pictures. They asked me for pictures for this, and I struggled. I had pictures from her childhood. But I had to go to Facebook to find pictures of my child, because we were always together. I saw her a couple times a month, at least, and we would text each other fairly often, and we would Facebook message at bedtime, \"I love you,\" \"I love you. You doing OK?\" \"Yeah, I love you.\" So I have no regrets on that part. Take pictures of the ones that you love, because you don't know when they're not going to be there.\n\nBut here's what I want to say to you today. This could be a storm in a teacup, and it could all be for nothing. This could have -- I could have said, \"Let's don't do this publicly. Let's have a small private funeral.\" But, you know, that's not who Heather was. Anybody who knew Heather said, \"Yeah, this is the way she had to go, big and large.\" Had to have the world involved, because that's my child. She's just that way. Always has been, and she will continue to be.\n\nBecause here's the message. Although Heather was a caring and compassionate person, so are a lot of you. A lot of you go that extra mile. And I think the reason that what happened to Heather has struck a chord is because we know that what she did is achievable. We don't all have to die. We don't all have to sacrifice our lives. They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what. You just magnified her.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nSo, here's what I want to happen. You ask me, \"What can I do?\" So many caring people, pages of pages of pages of stuff I'm going through. I'm reading pages of pages of pages how she's touching the world. I want this to spread. I don't want this to die. This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy. This is not the end of Heather's legacy.\n\nYou need to find in your heart that small spark of accountability. What is there that I can do to make the world a better place? What injustice do I see -- and want to turn away: \"I don't really want to get involved in that. I don't want to speak up. They'll be annoyed with me. My boss might think less of me.\" I don't care. You poke that finger at yourself, like Heather would have done, and you make it happen. You take that extra step. You find a way to make a difference in the world.\n\nMy child had a high school education. My child was no saint. She was hard to raise, because everything was a negotiation. Not kidding. But you know what? She was a firm believer in whatever she believed. And let's do that. Let's find that spark of conviction. Let's find in ourselves that action. Let's spread this. Let's have the uncomfortable dialogue.\n\nIt ain't easy sitting down and saying, \"Well, why are you upset?\" It ain't easy sitting down and going, \"Yeah, well, I think this way. And I don't agree with you, but I'm going to respectfully listen to what you have to say. We're not going to sit around and shake hands and go 'Kumbaya.' And I'm sorry, it's not all about forgiveness. I know that that's not a popular trend. But the truth is, we are going to have our differences. We are going to be angry with each other. But let's channel that anger, not into hate, not into violence, not into fear, but let's channel that difference, that anger, into righteous action.\"\n\nRight now, down the road, there is a blood drive going on in Heather's name. Right now, there are people who are here willing to listen to one another and talk to one another. Last night in New England, they had a peaceful rally in Heather's name to have some difficult dialogues. If you ever want to see what one of those dialogues looks like, look at her Facebook post. I'm telling you, they were rough sometimes. But they were dialogues. And the conversations have to happen. That's the only way we're going to carry Heather's spark through.\n\nSo, remember in your heart: If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. And I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong. Don't ignore it. Don't look the other way. You make it a point to look at it, and say to yourself, \"What can I do to make a difference?\" And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile. I'd rather have my child, but, by golly, if I got to give her up, we're going to make it count.", "id": "9541760", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Video: Full Remarks of Heather Heyer's Mother at Charlottesville Memorial Service", "image": "https://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/67/38067/full_hd/Susan-Mother1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Blood donation"}, "id": "302503", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heart"}, "id": "302554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Education"}, "id": "304279", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"}, {"label": {"eng": "Video game"}, "id": "304359", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Funeral"}, "id": "304953", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saint"}, "id": "305574", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England"}, "id": "309397", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finger"}, "id": "313335", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kumbaya"}, "id": "392631", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbaya"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tempest in a teapot"}, "id": "719704", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_in_a_teapot"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1012, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare"}], "time": "18:27:00"}

She would stand at the corner of the dining room table, waving her hands, almost dancing as she went over a story, Shrader said.\n\nHeyer wanted fairness and justice in her early years, he said, and \"could call out something that didn't seem right to her.\" And even if she didn't agree with someone's viewpoint, she still wanted to understand it, he said.\n\nHeyer, who worked as a paralegal, had that desire for justice throughout her life, Shrader said, adding, \"how ironic that she ended up in a law office.\"\n\n\"She realized we all need forgiveness and we all must extend forgiveness,\" he said. \"As we think about her today, we're very proud of her.\"\n\nShrader also expressed his appreciation for the community's support at this time.\n\nHeyer's father, Mark Heyer, gave an emotional speech, saying, \"No father should have to do this.\"\n\n\"She wanted equality,\" he said, \"and in this issue of the day of her passing, she wanted to put down hate. And for my part, we just need to stop all this stuff and just forgive each other.\n\n\"I came here today and I was overwhelmed,\" he said. \"I was overwhelmed at the rainbow of colors in this room. That's how Heather was. It didn't matter who you were or where you were from. If she loved you, that was it. You were stuck. So for that, I'm truly proud of my daughter. \"\n\nThe Saturday crash that killed Heather Heyer took place at a Unite the Right rally spurred by Charlottesville's plan to remove a Confederate statue from a local park. The rally was attended by neo-Nazis, skinheads and Ku Klux Klan members. They were met with hundreds of counterprotesters, which led to street brawls and violent clashes.\n\nA driver plowed into counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others.

At her funeral service, Susan Bro, Heyer's mother, spoke words that rang defiant and strong. But it was this one quote from Heyer's mom at her memorial service that served as a reminder that the responsibility for changing today's hate lies with all of us.\n\n\"They tried to kill my child to shut her up,\" Bro told the crowd attending the memorial, which was filmed by ABC News. \"Well guess what? You just magnified her.\"\n\nBro teared up as the room broke out into applause.\n\nIn a speech that seemed determined to continue that legacy, Bro then asked attendees to step up and take true accountability for the startling events currently unfolding across the United States. She pointed out the many ways Americans around the country had turned their shock and outrage at Heyer's death into positive action -- such as blood drives, peaceful rallies, and the initiation of difficult conversations.\n\n\"You need to find it in your heart that small spark of accountability,\" Bro said, according to ABC News. \"You poke that finger at yourself like Heather would have done, and you make it happen. You take that extra step. You find a way to make a difference in the world.\"\n\nShe urged people to look inwards and ask themselves, \"What can I do?\" in light of her daughter's death, rather than reacting with further anger and division. In a time when it's all too easy to meet hate with more hate, responding with compassion can be a difficult reaction. However, as Bro told CNN on Monday -- according to HuffPost -- about the man who killed her daughter:\n\nIf a woman who lost her daughter over the weekend can emerge from such a tragic incident with a renewed sense of passion, caring, and responsibility, then so can the rest of us. \"Let's channel that anger not into hate, not into violence, not into fear, but let's channel that difference, that anger, into righteous action,\" Bro said at her daughter's memorial.\n\nBro finished her speech with a heartbreaking -- and powerful -- line: \"I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I have to give her up, we're going to make it count,\" she said, before leaving the stage.

Heather refused, so her mother said she couldn't go to the pool. \"Well, for the next two hours, Heather decided that she knew better, at nine, and defied her mom,\" he said with a chuckle. \"To this day, I don't really remember how that turned out...

Ricardo Kaulessar/NorthJersey.com\n\n6 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nWhen America mourns, the president grieves with her. He attempts to put the tragedy in perspective. On Wednesday, at the memorial service for Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Va., it was not a president who found the right words. It was a mother.\n\n\"They tried to kill my child to shut her up - well, guess what - you just magnified her,\" Heyer's mother said.\n\nHeyer, 32, was killed Saturday when a car plowed into a crowd of protesters who were marching as counterpoint to a Unite the Right rally that had brought neo-Nazis, white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan members to Charlottesville. The previous night, mainly young, white men bearing torches chanted through the streets, shouting \"Blood and Soil,\" a popular phrase of the Nazis. On Saturday, protests turned violent.\n\nIn the days since, much attention has focused not on Heyer, but on President Donald Trump and his initial response to the violence. Trump first said there was blame on many sides, giving a false equivalency between white supremacists and counter-protesters. After much blow-back, the president delivered a scripted response Monday, denouncing racists. But on Tuesday, in a free-flowing, non-scripted exchange with the media, he took it all back.\n\nCharlottesville: N.J. Democrats call latest Trump statements on Charlottesville 'sickening,' 'unbelievable'\n\nFor Susan Bro there is no going back. On Wednesday, in a Charlottesville theater, she told the audience, \"I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I have to give her up, we're going to make it count. I want this to spread, I don't want this to die. This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy.\"\n\nHeyer's murder was the result of another American legacy, one of racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry.\n\n\"It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches, not random but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress an act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination, violence and suspicion, an act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation's original sin.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama offered those words at the memorial for the men and women gunned down in the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., in June 2015, by a self-avowed racist. It was Obama's most poignant speech. Yes, the U.S. president has a place at moments of national grief.\n\nGiven his rhetoric, Trump would hardly have been welcome at Heyer's memorial. Yet his absence is another tragedy in a series of tragedies. Because Susan Bro, while surrounded by Americans of many creeds and colors, should also have been embraced by the leader of America, its president.\n\nIt is unclear where we, as nation, go from this place of sorrows. On Wednesday, the National Park Services reported the Lincoln Memorial had been vandalized. One of its columns had been tagged in red spray paint with the words \"[expletive] law.\"\n\nYet Trump wants to deflect attention from the actions of racists. On Tuesday, he even questioned why there was a need to remove statues honoring Confederate leaders. He said, \"So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nFor Heather Heyer it stopped on a street in Charlottesville.\n\nTwo years ago in Charleston, Obama said, \"According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It's not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God.\"\n\nGrace is found in the thousands Americans who are horrified by what happened in Charlottesville and by the thousands of Americans who came to that same city Wednesday to show the face of Good to the face of Hate.\n\nIn the words of Susan Bro, \"This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy.\"\n\n6 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2

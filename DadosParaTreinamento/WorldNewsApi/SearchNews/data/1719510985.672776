Palace finished the season in sensational form and are planning to back manager Oliver Glasner as much as they can in the summer, with European qualification the target for 2024/25. They are already closing in on their first signing, with the Daily Mail reporting that Riad is due to travel to England on Monday to undergo a medical at Selhurst Park. It was said last week that the Eagles had offered Real Betis \u00a312.7million for the defender\u2019s services, with a further \u00a31.7m in add-ons. The 20-year-old missed Betis\u2019 goalless draw at Real Madrid on Saturday as he prepared to fly out, but did make 30 appearances across all competitions to help his side finish seventh in La Liga and qualify for the Europa Conference League. Riad came through Barcelona\u2019s academy, joining Betis for just \u00a33m last summer, with the Catalan giants due 50% of the profits from any future transfer. All this could mean that Glasner is preparing for life after Guehi who is among the many Eagles stars tipped for a move this summer, a list that includes Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise, Jean Philippe-Mateta and Adam Wharton.

Alongside Eze, Wharton and Palace keeper Dean Henderson, he was called up to England\u2019s provisional Euro 2024 squad and is likely to start their opening match against Serbia should Harry Maguire fail to recover from injury in time. The Mail add that Riad is \u20186ft 3ins tall, athletic, quick and left-footed\u2019, seemingly making the Morocco international the perfect replacement for Guehi, who is valued at upwards of \u00a355m.

As it stands, the club only have five centre-back options, namely Guehi, Joachim Andersen, Chris Richards, Rob Holding and Joel Ward, though it could be six if Nathaniel Clyne pens a new deal. It should also be noted that Chelsea will also have the chance to re-sign their academy graduate, as they have a clause in his contract that allows them to match any offer for the defender.

After a par on the par-4 17th, Capan III headed to the par-5 18th with the chance to make an eagle to shoot a record-breaking 56.\n\nHowever, having found a fairway bunker off the tee, Capan III was forced to lay up and eventually settled for another par to card a back-nine 29 and a round of 58.\n\nThe superb round marks the sixth sub-60 round on the Korn Ferry Tour in the last 12 months and the second since Del Solar's record-breaking 57 in February.\n\nPlaying in the morning wave of the first round, Capan III currently holds a three-shot lead over Trent Phillips who shot a 10-under-par 61.

Frankie Capan III fired a 13-under 58 in Round 1 of the Korn Ferry Tour's Veritex Bank Championship on Thursday to clip Scheffler's low mark at at Texas Rangers Golf Club in Arlington, Texas, by one. The world No. 1's 59 had stood as the course benchmark for four years.\n\nThe 24-year-old began his day with a par before rattling off four straight birdies to get his round rolling in the right direction. He remained at 4 under up until the par-5 9th where the big bird landed and allowed Capan to turn in 6-under 29. The eagle at the turn jump started Capan's round and was the appetizer for a back nine to remember.\n\nBirdies from the blade of Capan came on the next seven (!) holes, getting him to 13 under on the par-71 layout with two holes remaining. After playing the stretch from Nos. 9-16 in 9 under, Capan still faced the chance to pick off a couple more, especially with a closing par 5 on deck.\n\nThe right hander carded his first par in a couple hours on the par-4 17th and was unable to put one last par breaker on his card after hitting his drive on the par-5 18th in the fairway bunker. Instead, Capan settled for par on the 18th and the second-ever 58 in Korn Ferry Tour history.\n\nCapan's 58 adds to a growing list of sub-60 rounds on the Korn Ferry Tour over the last year. A couple months ago, Cristobol del Solar fired a 57 to set the record for the lowest round in a PGA Tour-sanctioned event. Aldrich Potgieter shot 59 later that same week in Colombia.

Today, former Bama and FGCU golfer Frankie Capan III went into the par-5 18th hole with the chance to break that record of 57.\n\nIf he had eagle'd the hole he would have shot a Korn Ferry Record 56.

Check it out:\n\nImagine telling someone before their round that they would only make 5 pars that day and what that would do to their nerves. Nobody ever imagines they're going out and scoring below par on 13 of the 18 holes.\n\nBy the way, he hit 17 of 18 Greens in Regulation (94.44%).

With the par-5 18th still to play, Capan had in his sights on 57, the mark achieved by Cristobal del Solar two months ago at the KFT's Astara Golf Championship in Bogota, Colombia.\n\nCapan ended pup closing with consecutive pars to card a 13-under 58 - and he only has a three-shot lead over second-place Trent Phillips, who shot 61, while last week's winner, Tim Widing, is third at 9 under, four back.\n\nThe round fell a stroke shy of del Solar's 13-under 57 and the 11-under 57 shot by David Carey on the Alps Tour in 2019. Del Solar's 57 came with a bit of caveat, too, as Country Club de Bogota's Pacos Course, a par 70, was playing at 6,254 yards - and at about 8,600 feet above sea level.\n\nStephan Jaeger held the previous KFT record of 12-under 58, recorded at the 2016 Ellie Mae Classic. Five other 58s have been recorded on world-ranked tours - Jim Furyk (PGA Tour), Alex del Rey (Challenge Tour), Ryo Ishikawa (Japan Tour), S.H. Kim (Japan Tour) and Jason Bohn (Canadian Tour). Bryson DeChambeau had a 58 of his own last year at LIV Greenbrier.\n\nCapan's day began with birdies at Nos. 2-5 before the Stillwater, Minnesota, native caught fire with an eagle at the par-5 ninth followed by seven straight birdies.\n\nCapan began his college career at Alabama before transferring to Florida Gulf Coast. He turned pro in 2022, yet remained amateur through that summer. He then advanced through all four stages of Korn Ferry Tour Q-School, medaling at two of the sites, to earn his KFT card for the first time last season. He finished No. 51 on the points list as a rookie.\n\nThis season, Capan sits No. 30 in points, right on the bubble for earning a PGA Tour card at the end of the year.

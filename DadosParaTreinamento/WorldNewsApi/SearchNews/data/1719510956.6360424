{"id": 223813382, "title": "Slow review \u2013 terrific Lithuanian drama of an atypical romance", "text": "Two people can be seemingly made for each other and still find themselves out of kilter in a relationship. The attraction between dancer Elena (Greta Grinevi\u010di\u016bte) and sign language interpreter Dovydas (K\u0119stutis Cic\u0117nas) is immediate. Elena is sensual and physically expressive, both professionally and in her many relationships. Dovydas, meanwhile, is asexual. But the fact that he doesn\u2019t need or even want to have sex with Elena doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her. It takes a bit of getting used to, but for a while it seems that love might conquer all, even the fundamental differences in their needs. Tensions between them are evocatively captured in this Lithuanian drama: an awkward, uneasy coupling between the pair is kept in a restrained mid shot, but the sequence that follows, showing Elena dancing with two colleagues, is filmed so intimately in closeup that the sweat and skin almost becomes abstract. The second feature film from director Marija Kavtaradze (Summer Survivors), Slow is terrific \u2013 an honest and affecting portrait of an atypical romance. In UK and Irish cinemas now", "summary": "<p>Marija Kavtaradze\u2019s affecting film explores the relationship between a passionately physical woman and a man who is asexual</p><p>Two people can be seemingly made for each other and still find themselves out of kilter in a relationship.

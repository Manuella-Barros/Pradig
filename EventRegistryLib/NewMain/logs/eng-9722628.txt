The VAR for the clash was Bastian Dankert, who recommended that Zwayer look at the pitchside monitor after reviewing the incident.\n\nTelegraph Sport columnist Jamie Carragher said it was \"never a penalty\" while Lee Dixon, co-commentating on ITV, said: \"I'm pleased, don't get me wrong but you have to challenge for the ball. I don't think it's a penalty but I don't care.\"\n\nGary Neville and Ian Wright were involved in a heated exchange in the ITV studio at half time as they disagreed with the decision.\n\nNeville said: \"As a defender, I think it's a disgrace. To give that penalty at any time, but in a semi-final. It's nowhere near a penalty and not many England players were claiming it. You take your luck.\"\n\nWright replied: \"That is reckless. His studs are up. They've given it - anywhere else on the pitch and it's a foul.\"\n\nBut Neville snapped back: \"If someone thinks that's reckless? Honestly that's not a penalty. There has to be licence to try and block the shot.\"\n\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC 5 Live, said: \"England players are looking at the referee, they think there is a collision. Denzel Dumfries does connect with Harry Kane. There was no contact to the ball from Dumfries.\"\n\nMichael Owen, who controversially won a penalty at the World Cup against Argentina in 2002 that David Beckham scored, said England had \"got lucky\" with the penalty.\n\nThe appointment of Zwayer was controversial because he was embroiled in a match-fixing scandal earlier in his career.\n\nIn 2006, Zwayer admitted taking money from banned referee Robert Hoyzer, who was accused of match-fixing but not of altering the outcome of a game. Zwayer was given a six-month DFB ban, having been one of the officials who brought Hoyzer's match-fixing plot to light.\n\n'VAR was wrong to intervene'\n\nThe VAR was wrong to intervene. The referee's judgement from a good position was correct. There was no foul and therefore no penalty kick should have been awarded.\n\nThis was not a clear and obvious error and sadly we see yet again VAR intervention and the referee not sticking with his original decision.\n\nThe referee was ideally positioned.

They're both going for the ball, it's a split second.\n\n'I don't think that's a penalty but I don't care! I really don't care.'\n\nFormer Scotland and Rangers striker McCoist, meanwhile, suggested VAR should not have intervened given it was not a 'clear and obvious error' from Dumfries.\n\n'I'll give you my tuppence worth right now,' McCoist said.\n\n'The fact of the matter is that the defender is going to block the ball and, in truth, Harry Kane has kicked him because he's followed through and he has to take the shot on.\n\n'It's not a penalty for me but as soon as the referee goes over... I certainly don't think for a minute that it's a clear and obvious error.'\n\nChristina Unkel, working as a refereeing analyst for ITV in Germany, was also taken aback by the decision to go to VAR for the 18th-minute penalty incident.\n\nAsked whether there was any suggestion of a foul on first viewing, she replied: 'No. No suggestion by the VAR for recommendation of a penalty.\n\n'Once Kane gets the shot off and it's clear and natural... we'll take a lot to see if Dumfries' action goes above and beyond.'\n\nUnkel added: 'One of the surprising things here is is there a studs contact? Yes, from Dumfries on to the top of the boot from Kane.\n\n'However, Kane is getting the shot off completely his momentum is following him through.\n\n'I'm quite surprised this is being sent.

It's nowhere near a penalty and I have say, I don't think there weren't many England players claiming for it either.\n\n'Harry stayed down, he got a little bit of a tap on his foot, but it's never a penalty for me.\n\n'Obviously you take your luck. England have played really well in that first half.'\n\nIan Wright disagreed with Neville, though, arguing that Dumfries' challenge on Kane was 'reckless' and would have been deemed a foul in any other area of the pitch.\n\n'When you look at the way that penalties are given now and the way the game is with things that go to VAR, that was reckless,' the former Arsenal and England striker bit back.\n\n'From Dumfries, the way he's challenged there. Gary! That's why he's given it! We've got VAR, we've got everything and they've given it.\n\n'If that's anywhere else on the pitch you'd get a foul for it. Penalties are given for those.'\n\nNeville refused to lie down, suggesting that fans and pundits were 'going mad' if Dumfries' challenge was deemed a foul in the modern game.\n\n'We're all going mad. We all don't know what a penalty is [anymore], we think that's reckless...' he added.\n\n'If someone thinks that is reckless... we've conditioned ourselves now in the game whereby we think that's reckless and that's a penalty.\n\n'Honestly, that is not a penalty.'\n\nChristina Unkel, ITV's refereeing analyst in Germany, appeared to agree with Neville's stance and was taken aback by the decision to consult VAR for the 18th-minute penalty incident.\n\nAsked whether there was any suggestion of a foul on first viewing, she replied: 'No. No suggestion by the VAR for recommendation of a penalty.\n\n'Once Kane gets the shot off and it's clear and natural... we'll take a lot to see if Dumfries' action goes above and beyond.'\n\nUnkel added: 'One of the surprising things here is is there a studs contact? Yes, from Dumfries on to the top of the boot from Kane.\n\n'However, Kane is getting the shot off completely his momentum is following him through.\n\n'I'm quite surprised this is being sent. It's not a clear and obvious error and in fact the preferred recommendation is for this not to be a penalty.'", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Dixon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Dixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_McCoist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally McCoist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-at-21.23.50-dcc3.png?crop=0px%2C98px%2C1938px%2C1019px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722628", "eventUri": "eng-9722628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

A Bukayo Saka cross in the 14th minute was volleyed over the bar by Harry Kane, with Denzel Dumfries attempting to block the shot and connecting with the England skipper.\n\nAfter being directed to go to the monitor by his VAR, Euro 2024 referee Felix Zwayer pointed to the spot after deeming Dumfries' contact to be a foul.\n\nVIDEO Why Cody Gakpo's A Huge Problem For England\n\nThe decision was quickly criticised by fans and pundits alike, but Kane wasted no time in converting the spot kick to level the match against the Netherlands. The score remained 1-1 at half-time and there was only one topic up for conversation during the break.\n\n\"Look, as a defender I think it's an absolute disgrace,\" former England right-back Gary Neville exclaimed on ITV. \"I think it's an absolutely disgraceful decision.\n\n\"To have that given against me as a penalty at any time, but in a game of such importance. I was fuming with the one the other week, the Denmark one, the handball, that was a disgrace as well, I was offended by that one.\n\n\"I have to say, he just goes in naturally just to try and block the shot. it's not a penalty for me, it's nowhere near a penalty. I have to say I don't think there were many England players claiming for it either.\n\n\"Harry obviously stayed down, he got a little bit of a tap on his foot, but it's never a penalty for me. But obviously you take your luck England have played really well that first half.\"\n\nIan Wright was on hand alongside Neville to provide the perspective from a former striker's point of view, saying: \"Gary, I think when you look at the way that penalties are given now, and the way the game is and when things go to VAR, that was reckless.\n\n\"The way he's challenged. That's why he's given it. We've got VAR, we've got everything. If that's anywhere else on the pitch you get a foul for it.\"\n\nA to and fro ensued, with Neville saying: \"We're all going mad. We all don't know what a penalty is. If someone thinks that's reckless then honestly... we've conditioned ourselves now in the game where we think that's reckless and we think that's a penalty, honestly, that is not a penalty.\"\n\nUndeterred, Wright continued with his argument: \"If you put that in the midfield, his studs are up, it's soft, you can say whatever you want, but his studs are up, those are given as penalties now,\" he said before Neville had his final say on the incident.\n\n\"I think in the box there's a little bit of licence for a defender to go with honesty and block the shot,\" he concluded. \"There's got to be a little bit of licence to block the shot, otherwise you're never going to block a shot.\"\n\nGet a free live stream to watch Euro 2024 from anywhere in the world and catch the final stages of the summer's big tournament\n\nNetherlands star Xavi Simons had 1m Instagram followers by age 14 after becoming a viral internet sensation -

Zwayer was given a six-month DFB ban, having been one of the officials who brought Hoyzer's match-fixing plot to light.\n\nThe VAR was wrong to intervene.

But they were level on 18 minutes after Harry Kane was fouled by Denzel Dumfries in the penalty area and buried the resulting spot-kick.\n\nKane blasted over the bar from a loose ball before being caught by a high foot from the Netherlands right-back. The referee initially waved away the appeal, but the VAR sent him to the pitchside monitor where he reversed his decision.\n\nSpeaking on ITV at half-time, Neville said: \"As a defender, I think it's an absolutely disgraceful decision. To have that given against me as a penalty at any time, let alone in such an important game. He just goes in naturally to try and block the shot. It's not a penalty for me. It's nowhere near a penalty. I have to say, there weren't many England players asking for it either.\"\n\nBut Wright disagreed, describing Dumfries' challenge as \"reckless\". He added: \"When you look at the way penalties are given now and the way the game is when we go to VAR, that was reckless.\"\n\nNeville shot back: \"Reckless? That is not reckless. Oh my God.\" Wright continued: \"But Gary, he's given it. That's why we've got VAR. If that was anywhere else on the pitch you'd get a foul for it!\"\n\nLee Dixon summed up the mood on co-commentary for ITV, saying: \"I would be astonished if this was given.\" His colleague Ally McCoist then cut in: \"The fact he's running over, I'll be astonished if it isn't given.\"\n\nITV's refereeing expert Christina Unkel then said: \"I am [astonished].

However, Kane is getting the shot off completely, his momentum is going through.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! What did you make of the decision? Comment below.\n\n\"I am quite surprised that this is being sent [to the pitchside monitor] because it is not a clear and obvious error and in fact the preferred recommendation is for this not to be a penalty.\"\n\nDixon added: \"I'm pleased, don't get me wrong.

But England were handed a lifeline by referee Felix Zweyer and the VAR team.\n\nEngland captain Harry Kane was involved in a collision in the box with Dumfries as the Bayern Munich man looked to take a shot at goal. While Kane stayed on the floor, play went on before referee Zweyer was sent to the monitor to review the flashpoint by the VAR team. He would points to the spot before Kane coolly converted.\n\nBut former England international Neville couldn't wrap his head around the call on ITV. He rinsed the match officials stating: \"As a defender, I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute disgraceful decision - to have given against me as a defender at any time but especially in a semi-final. I have to say he just goes in naturally to block the shot, that is nowhere near a penalty.\n\n\"I have to say I don't think there was many England players claiming for it either. Harry stayed down, he had a bit of a tap on his foot, but it's never a penalty for me. But you take your luck.\"\n\nWright took a totally different viewpoint: \"I think when you look at the way penalties are given now and the way that penalties are given now, that is reckless...\" Neville was left in disbelief: \"Reckless? That is not reckless. Oh my god...\"\n\nThe Arsenal legend was undeterred: \"It is reckless, that is why they have given it. We have VAR, we have everything. If that is anywhere else on the pitch you get a foul for it.\"\n\nBut Sky Sports sparring partner Jamie Carragher would offer Neville back up. The Liverpool legend told the Telegraph : \"That was never a pen. I can't believe the referee was asked by the VAR to look at it. And then I can't believe he gave it.

More info\n\nAlly McCoist has slapped down commentary partner Lee Dixon after he brushed off a controversial penalty awarded to England.\n\nWith the Netherlands leading 1-0 in the Euro 2024 semi-final, England captain Harry Kane was involved in a collision in the box with Denzel Dumfries as the Bayern Munich man looked to take a shot at goal. Play went on before referee Felix Zweyer was sent to the monitor to review the flashpoint by the VAR team - and he would eventually point to the spot.\n\nThat gave Kane the chance to level the showdown in Germany - and he made no mistake from 12 yards. Dixon couldn't hide his delight on air as he brushed aside any controversy: \"'I am pleased, don't get me wrong. But from a defenders point of view you have got to challenge for the ball. I don't think that is a penalty, but I don't care...\"\n\nBut Rangers legend McCoist wasn't willing to let his commentary pal off: \"I will give you my tuppence worth right now. The fact of the matter is that the defender is going for the ball, and in truth Harry Kane has kicked him because he is following through because he has got to take the shot on.\"\n\nThe Scotland hero would go on to question the use of VAR adding: \"Not a penalty for me. As soon as the referee was going over you knew it (would be given) but I don't think for a minute it's a clear and obvious error.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_pirie@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Mark Pirie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Dixon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Dixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_McCoist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ally McCoist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33215548.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Netherlands-UEFA-Euro-2024-Semi-Final-BVB-Stadion-Dortmund.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722628", "eventUri": "eng-9722628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

A wonderstrike by Xavi Simons was cancelled out by Harry Kane's goal from the penalty spot. There was confusion around VAR's decision to award a penalty, and Carragher shared those sentiments.\n\nJamie Carragher has slammed the decision to award a penalty in England's Euro 2024 semi-final match against the Netherlands, a call which ultimately led to Harry Kane levelling the tie. The Three Lions striker's goal cancelled out Xavi Simons' wonderstrike which he notched in the opening seven minutes of the game.\n\nBoth sides came into the tie hoping to book their spot in the final of the competition on Sunday, with a match against Spain waiting in store for the victor of their last-four clash. And England were immediately pegged back at the start after Simons robbed Declan Rice of the ball and smashed it home from outside the penalty area.\n\nBut Gareth Southgate's side were handed a route back into the game just 10 minutes later after a VAR intervention. Kane was adjudged to have been fouled by Denzel Dumfries inside the box, and he made no mistake from the spot.\n\nCarragher's Tweet About Penalty Goes Viral Former England international was in shock\n\nThere was a substantial amount of confusion that VAR stepped in to give the penalty, especially as it was Kane who tried to kick the ball and seemingly kicked Dumfries. ITV's VAR expert Christina Unkel did not think it should have been given when reviewing the incident, but Felix Zwayer thought otherwise.\n\nAnd despite supporting the Three Lions during the match, Carragher was also perplexed that a penalty had been given for the supposed foul. Taking to X to voice his opinion, the former Liverpool man said that the contact was, 'never a penalty'. He most likely won't have been complaining when Kane's shot hit the back of the net, though.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/carra-tweet-pen.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722628", "eventUri": "eng-9722628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He was caught by Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries after releasing the shot, and went down in pain. Referee Felix Zwayer pointed for a goal kick, but after a few moments it became clear the VAR was checking for a possible penalty.\n\nVAR decision: Penalty, scored by Kane.\n\nVAR review: There's an unwritten law in football that if a player manages to complete a shot on goal and is then caught by a defending player, there shouldn't be a penalty. So why is that? Mainly it's because the attacking team cannot lose out on anything because of the challenge -- the shot has been released and the move is over.\n\nIt's seems odd, because often in this situation we'd say \"but that's a foul anywhere else on the pitch.\" But make no mistake, there's another unwritten law that the threshold is far higher on a penalty providing a shot on goal vs. a free kick in an area that isn't immediately dangerous.\n\nSo, how did England get a penalty in this situation?\n\nIt's a very harsh intervention by the VAR, Bastian Dankert. It's his ninth game of the tournament, far more than any other video assistant. He has clearly earned a reputation within UEFA as its most trusted VAR throughout the tournament.\n\nSo, why has Dankert advised a penalty? He has taken the nature of Dumfries' challenge, leading with the studs as opposed to making an attempt to kick through the ball, as being reckless -- which is why the Netherlands' player was booked.

After referee Felix Zwayer awarded Harry Kane an extremely dubious penalty on Wednesday, we will probably not have the same discussion about England's semifinal match with the Netherlands.\n\nYou see, Zwayer has a rather unfortunate history for someone officiating one of the biggest games in soccer. We're talking about the worst kind of history for any sports referee. In 2005, Zwayer confessed to match-fixing by taking a bribe from another official to favor a German domestic club in a match.\n\nHe was appropriately banned from refereeing for six months but ... he's still working now. Oof.\n\nAfter seeing Kane get a penalty shot from Zwayer for kicking a prayer ball in the air with Denzel Dumfries defending him, questions about the ref fixing the match will likely reach a fever pitch should England advance to the 2024 Euro Final.\n\nSeriously, on what planet is any of that worthy of a penalty shot?\n\nThe explanation is that Dumfries kicked Kane and impeded him from getting a quality shot off. But the replay makes it pretty clear that Kane made more of a strike at Dumfries and that Kane's attempt looked more like a Hail Mary attempt than an obvious open crack at the goal. Sure, it's a bang-bang play, but in no just universe should Kane have been able to get England on the board for this weird sequence.\n\nThis was the soccer equivalent of giving a receiver a pass interference call on an uncatchable ball.\n\nAs for why someone might want to fix the match for England, well, they're one of the tournament favorites!\n\nEntering this semifinal match, oddsmakers with BetMGM had England heavily favored to at least make the Final this Sunday in Berlin.\n\nYou connect the dots as to why there would be rightful concerns about match-fixing after seeing this questionable Kane penalty shot.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_zeglinski@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Zeglinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shot_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shot (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Replay (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-at-1.35.22-PM-e1720640170996.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722628", "eventUri": "eng-9722628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

A VAR review advised referee Felix Zwayer take another look and he bizarrely pointed to the spot.\n\nEngland's tails were up after that and it was the best half of football that Gareth Soutgate's side have played at the tournament by some distance.

Played an important role on the ball keeping England high.\n\nCB: John Stones - 6/10 - Protected from any kind of direct centre forward threat.\n\nCB: Marc Guehi - 6/10 - Understandably not as adventurous as Walker on the other side of the back three but pretty much flawless with his passing.\n\nRM: Bukayo Saka - 6/10 - Not as involved as others like Bellingham or Foden but it his jinking run inside and blocked shot that resulted in Kane winning the penalty.\n\nCM: Declan Rice - 4/10 - Weak in his duel with Simons when he lost the ball that directly led to England falling behind in the opening stages.\n\nCM: Kobbie Mainoo - 8/10 - Seemed to really thrive linking up with two number 10s finding space in pockets ahead of him.\n\nLM: Kieran Trippier - 7/10 - Deliberately occupied a really high position that seemed to stifle the attacking threat of Dumfries.\n\nAM: Phil Foden - 9/10 - Easily his best 45 minutes of the summer. Had one effort stopped on the line after dancing through the Dutch defence and later hit the post too.\n\nAM: Jude Bellingham - 8/10 - When he started to get a foothold in the game at 1-0 down, England suddenly looked a different beast.\n\nST: Harry Kane - 7/10 - Didn't deserve a penalty when he made contact with Dumfries, rather than the other way round, but he converted it with such confidence.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWA_Footballer_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FWA Footballer of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6647,h_3738,x_0,y_692/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j2f2arvc10h32xv3zq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722628", "eventUri": "eng-9722628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He just goes in naturally to block the shot. It's not a penalty for me. You have to take your luck though.\"\n\nBut Wright disagreed, describing Dumfries' challenge as \"reckless\" and added: \"When you look at the way penalties are given now and the way the game is when we go to VAR, that was reckless.\"\n\nNeville fired back: \"Reckless? That is not reckless. Oh my God.\" Wright continued: \"But Gary, he's given it. That's why we've got VAR.

The plan introduced under Rishi Sunak allows certain prisoners to be released up to 70 days before the end of their sentence in an effort to ease overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. The Tories had previously promised to deliver 20,000 new prison places, and 6,000 have been created so far. Labour said it would ensure the delivery of the remaining 14,000 by unblocking the planning process and boosting the prison-building programme. Shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood declined to rule out ending the early release scheme, as she said Labour would need to \u201clift the bonnet\u201d in government before knowing the true extent of the crisis in prisons. She told the BBC: \u201cI think actually the Government needs to level with the public. We all know that prisons are running at either 98% capacity or 99%. \u201cIt is a dereliction of duty that the Government hasn\u2019t actually released all of the figures about their early release scheme \u2013 they\u2019ve actually been doing that in secret. \u201cIt would be irresponsible for me from opposition, without seeing the data about the number of offenders that have been released or having all of that information, to make those decisions now.\u201d When again asked if she would rule out continuing early release, Ms Mahmood said: \u201cIt would be irresponsible to make those decisions from opposition without all of the information to hand. \u201cAn incoming Labour government, if we\u2019re privileged enough to win, would have to lift that bonnet and see what horrors await.\u201d At a campaign event in Essex, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was \u201ccritical\u201d of the early release scheme for prisoners but added that \u201ctough decisions\u201d would have to be taken. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service and barrister said: \u201cI am critical of the Tories\u2019 early release scheme because what\u2019s happened is that they\u2019re releasing early prisoners who should still be in prison and that\u2019s a shocking state of affairs. \u201cLike the many problems that they have left for the country, if we do come into power we\u2019re going to have to fix it. \u201cNow that will involve building prisons, that will involve taking tough decisions because the money has been allocated for prison building but there are tough decisions about planning and getting those prisons up.\u201d On Sunday Sir Keir also reiterated his commitment not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT in a future Government, despite a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) that tax rises would be necessary to maintain current levels of departmental funding. Ms Mahmood said solving overcrowding in prisons is \u201cnot a money problem\u201d. She told the BBC: \u201cPart of the reason we\u2019ve got overcrowding in our prisons is because the Government has run out of space because they haven\u2019t delivered the full 20,000 prison spaces that they said they will do by next year. \u201cIt\u2019s actually not a money problem in that respect. \u201cThe money has already been allocated in the Ministry of Justice budget, it\u2019s actually a failure of the Government because they\u2019ve allowed the planning system to get in the way and they\u2019ve allowed complaints from their Members of Parliament, backbenchers in particular, to stop any building in our country. \u201cSo this is actually about the Government having the will to get prisons built on day one. \u201cWe would designate prisons as being of national importance, so that those decisions are ultimately made by ministers rather than the usual planning process.\u201d In a further law and order offering, the party wants to set up 80 new specialist rape courts across England and Wales to fast-track cases as part of plans to tackle violence against women and girls that will be included in Labour\u2019s manifesto this week. Elsewhere on the morning rounds, Ms Mahmood defended her party from allegations they had changed so much they were unrecognisable from the Tories. Responding to a comment made by Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer during Friday\u2019s seven-way BBC debate that Labour had \u201cchanged into the Conservatives\u201d, Ms Mahmood said: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the kind of stuff you\u2019d expect from some of the smaller parties.\u201d She told Sky News: \u201cThere are billions of pounds worth of difference between us and the Tory Party, because we will make different decisions. \u201cFor example, levying VAT on private school fees, we will get non-doms to pay their fair share, we\u2019ll make sure oil and gas giants pay their fair share with the proper windfall tax. \u201cThat is a big difference between us and the Tory Party.\u201d", "summary": "Shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood said Labour would need to \u2018lift the bonnet\u2019 and assess the crisis in prisons.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-shabana-mahmood-labour-brewery-government-b1163135.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/11/18b333838ee727e27136dccb21d19317Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDE1NDQ4-2.75857814.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:29:08", "author": "Claudia Savage", "authors": ["Claudia Savage"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.458}

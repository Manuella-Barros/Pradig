{"id": 223806756, "title": "New booking rules for popular Glencorse next season", "text": "For the 2025 season onwards he will not take bookings six months in advance and frustrated Taylor said this move was due to constant overbooking by clubs. He said: \u201cIt is simply not sustainable in the current format. \u201cThis will also benefit club secretaires who have to deal with members not replying to emails or messages and will let them know exactly the number of boats required when making and confirming a booking.\u201d He argued: \u201cThis new policy will also benefit anglers looking to book a day boat, that are not in a club or group. We will start taking bookings for the 2025 season in January onwards. \u201cClubs must confirm their booking two weeks prior to the outing as it will be charged for the number of boats they book.\u201d All information about the chance is on www.glencorsersv.co.uk.

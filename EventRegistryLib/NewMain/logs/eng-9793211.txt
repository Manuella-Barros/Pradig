Trump praised the rule Saturday night.\n\n\"They just passed a rule for Georgia elections requiring that three people at each precinct independently count the total number of ballots before certification,\" Trump said of the SEB.\n\nIt's jarring enough that Trump name-checked these previously-obscure officials -- and that they received such a warm reception from the crowd -- but it's even more concerning that he praised some of their work specifically. Trump is not a man of details. The importance of him even being aware of a rule of such election minutiae as that passed at the SEB's last meeting is a shocking alarm bell that he and his campaign are highly aware of the mechanisms they need to employ in order to get their way in Georgia in November.\n\nPut more simply: Trump knows about certification, and his comments Saturday night are surely reflective of a much-deeper understanding of the issue within the highest ranks of the Republican party, signaling a clear plan to weaponize certification to their greatest advantage on election night.\n\nOf the three SEB members Trump praised -- and who were apparently in the audience Saturday night -- Jeffares and Johnston are confirmed election deniers, as I reported here at American Doom and for the Guardian. The third, King, is probably one as well, or is simply climbing her way up through the ranks of the Georgia Republican Party and doing whatever she's told by her handlers in her capacity as a member of the SEB.\n\nFor years, election deniers have worked the refs at the SEB, mostly to their advantage. Following Trump's loss in Georgia in 2020, state Republicans began to see the board as means to their ends. What was a board whose Republicans used to be of the Gov. Brian Kempian variety, appointed by the governor to enact his so-called \"election integrity\" initiatives, has morphed since 2020 into a board dominated by full-throated election deniers who are willing to stretch -- and probably break -- the law in order to ensure a Trump win in Georgia.\n\nIn his comments Saturday night, any semblance of independence that remained for those Republican board members was obliterated by Trump's comments. He confirmed what has been suspected: the Georgia SEB is in Trump's pocket.\n\n***", "source": {"uri": "american-doom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "american-doom.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_glawe@american-doom.com", "name": "Justin Glawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_12_Hours_of_Sebring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2022 12 Hours of Sebring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jeffares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Jeffares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fjustinglawe.substack.com%2Ftwitter%2Fsubscribe-card.jpg%3Fv%3D-569349553%26version%3D9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1242}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

And the trio came under fire recently from a good government group for quietly holding a meeting without the other two members in an attempt to pass new election rules that would increase the number of partisan poll watchers.\n\n\"To the extent that Trump is that intimately aware of who is on the State Election Board and is championing them ... that should raise the alarm bells for everybody, said Chioma Chukwu, the interim executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit that pushes for government transparency. American Oversight said that partisan actors could use the proposed rule changes to sow chaos and confusion into the 2024 election.\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election in Georgia by about 12,000 votes, and famously pressured Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, to help overturn the election. Neither agreed.\n\n\"In my opinion, they want us to lose,\" Trump said of the two men at the Saturday rally. He also called Kemp \"a bad guy\" and \"a disloyal guy.\"\n\nLegislature removed Raffensperger from State Election Board\n\nThe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the Georgia Senate, the Georgia House of Representatives each appoint one of four-member Georgia State Election Board. The governor appoints the chair.\n\nThe majority that questions the 2020 election results came into power this year, when Jaffares and King joined Dr. Janice Johnston, a 2022 Republican Party appointee who advocated for another state investigation into the 2020 election.\n\nThe board is responsible for creating rules to administer the state's elections, and for years was chaired by the secretary of state, who is elected. But months after the 2020 election, the Republican-majority state legislature passed a sweeping election overhaul law that implemented stricter new rules about voting and overhauled the board.\n\nThe law removed Raffensperger as the board's chair, instead making the secretary of state an advisory member without voting power, and giving the legislature the power to appoint the chair. Raffensperger has been a target of Trump and his allies ever since Trump called him days after the election and asked him to \"find\" enough votes to declare him the winner, and Raffensperger declined. (He also defeated a Trump-backed challenger in the 2022 primary.)\n\nThe law also gave the Election Board more power, including the ability to suspend some local election administrators. Then, in 2024, the legislature passed and Kemp signed another election bill that removed the secretary of state altogether.\n\n\"Brad is directly accountable to the voters,\" Jordan Fuchs, deputy secretary of state, said of Raffensperger in a statement to USA TODAY. \"These unelected board members are not, which allows them to be politically leveraged and chased down by every wild internet conspiracy theory.\"\n\nThree Trumpian Republicans make up a majority\n\nIn January, the Georgia Senate, run by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, confirmed Rick Jeffares as that body's pick for the board. Jeffares posted memes shortly after the 2020 election \"that suggested dead people had voted by mail, claimed the Democrats and China had colluded, and implied that Democrats had cheated,\" according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. (Jones, the lieutenant governor, served as a fake member of the Electoral College, as part of Trump's effort to overturn the election.)\n\nIn May, the state House of Representatives confirmed King to replace Ed Lindsey, a Republican who faced criticism on the right for his support for no-excuse absentee voting and his lobbying career. King proposed re-opening a state investigation of the 2020 election.\n\nThree members hastily adopted new election rules\n\nJaffres, Johnston and King met in July and hastily passed two election-related rules, but withdrew them after American Oversight sued alleging the members violated the state's Open Meetings Act.\n\nOne of the rules increased the number of partisan poll watchers to observe ballot counting, something that Chukwu of American Oversight said could increase the likelihood of intimidating election workers or having poll watchers observe personal information they're not supposed to see.\n\nThe other required county election boards to post daily ballot counts on their websites, something that Chukwu said Raffensperger's office already does.\n\n\"It's unclear the purpose of duplicating efforts that already exist, other than to provide individuals, partisan operatives, the ability to have a laser-focus in jurisdictions where they can decide they want to challenge voter registrations and votes,\" she said.\n\nAmerican Oversight alleged in its lawsuit the rules were unlawful because the members did not provide at least one week of advance notice; that the meeting did not involve a quorum of three people appearing in person because Johnston attended remotely; and did not provide teleconference access to the meeting for the general public.\n\nJeffares and Johnston didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmerican Oversight also said the three Republican board members went ahead with the July 12 meeting despite advance guidance from the Georgia Attorney General's office that the meeting would likely violate Georgia law. Kara Murray, the state Attorney General's office communications director, told USA TODAY the office can't speak about communications with the board because it represents the election board and therefore is constrained by attorney-client privilege.\n\nJanelle King, one of the board members Trump praised, told USA TODAY everything \"was conducted within legal limits as long as the majority of the board agreed to participate.\" However, \"in the spirit of board unity,\" they decided to redo the July 12 meeting and are now set to consider proposed rules Aug. 6.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party seeks involvement in the case\n\nAccording to American Oversight's lawsuit, Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon emailed the text of the two proposed rules to Jeffares on July 8. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also reported it had documents showing McKoon sent Jeffares the proposed rules as well as talking points on why to adopt them.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party asked a court July 25 to participate in American Oversight's lawsuit against the board members, saying it also has an interest in how the litigation turns out.\n\nAsked by USA TODAY if anyone from the Republican Party or Trump campaign tried to influence or pressure her to pass the rules, King replied, \"Absolutely not!\" and that she simply read the petitions and decided based on the facts and evidence.\n\nTrump praised the Georgia State Elections Board\n\nTrump declared at the Saturday Atlanta rally that the three Republican board members were \"on fire\" -- riling some Democrats concerned about the integrity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"He's clearly in favor of their efforts to alter how elections are certified,\" Dave Hoffman, communications director for Georgia Democrats, told USA TODAY. He pointed to the state Republican Party's role in the proposed rules and talking points.\n\nKing said she didn't speak to anyone from the state party, the Trump campaign, or the Republican National Committee about the rules. Asked about Trump's praise for her, she said there is low confidence in elections across the political spectrum, and she wants to ensure Georgia voters can have confidence in the results.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party said it was seeking to intervene in the American Oversight litigation to ensure Georgia elections \"are devoid of any fraud, deceit, or abuse.\"", "source": {"uri":

This would essentially give partisan county board of elections personal control over Georgia's election results, allowing them to uphold certifying the election if they disagree with the results.\"\n\nThe rule will take effect after 20 days, although it could be challenged in court.\n\nIt's yet another battle over what had long been an administrative afterthought, state and local boards certifying the results. With 90 days left in the presidential campaign, there could be more fighting in narrowly divided swing states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his allies have tried to block certification to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan's state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, some conservative, rural counties tried to hold up their state election results, citing the same debunked claims of voter fraud that Trump has made.\n\nIn Georgia, state officials had to order rural Coffee County to certify in 2020. In May Republican-appointed Fulton County election board member Julie Adams refused to certify primary election results after she filed a lawsuit backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute that argues county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. The rule the board adopted Tuesday was proposed by Michael Heekin, the other Republican-appointed member of the Fulton County board.\n\nHeekin on Tuesday rebutted claims that reasonable is a subjective term, saying it has an established legal meaning.\n\n\"It's guardrails to make the point that what we are doing is very important and it's not to be taken lightly,\" Heekin told the state board.\n\nBut Democrats and voting rights groups fear that Republicans on the board are laying the groundwork for Trump to dispute a Kamala Harris victory in Georgia.\n\n\"I'm saying that adopting a rule that's inconsistent with the statute and over 100 years of Georgia Supreme Court precedent is outside the authority of the board,\" said Nikhel Sus, a lawyer for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning group that focuses on government ethics and accountability.\n\nTuesday's action comes after a trio of Republican partisans aligned with Trump took control of the five-member regulatory board. It has no direct role in determining election results, but writes rules to ensure that elections run smoothly and hears complaints about violations.\n\nTrump himself praised those members during a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, saying the three \"are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,\" but criticizing the Democrat on the board and the nonpartisan chairman appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp, saying they \"aren't so good.\" Trump in particular singled out Johnston, a retired obstetrician and frequent critic of elections in deeply Democratic Fulton County, who was in the second row at Saturday's rally and stood to acknowledge Trump's praise.\n\n\"My courage was contagious?\" Trump said after Johnston stood. \"Well, your courage is contagious, too.\"\n\nCritics of the board's entanglement with Trump and Republican Party politics argue that it's not just unseemly, but may be violating the board's own code of conduct, which says members of the board \"shall be honest, fair, and avoid any appearance of conflict and/or impropriety.\"\n\nBoard member Janelle King, whose appointment cemented control to the Trump-aligned faction, denied that she's unduly influenced by her party. State Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon recently emailed proposed rules and talking points to the third member of the faction, former state Sen. Rick Jeffares.\n\n\"I don't make decisions based on what side of the aisle wants me to do something,\" King told reporters. \"I look at the facts, I look at the evidence, I look at what's in front of me, and I see if this is a good rule.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

With 90 days left in the presidential campaign, there could be more fighting in narrowly divided swing states.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his allies have tried to block certification to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan\u00b4s state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, some conservative, rural counties tried to hold up their state election results, citing the same debunked claims of voter fraud that Trump has made.\n\nIn Georgia, state officials had to order rural Coffee County to certify in 2020. In May Republican-appointed Fulton County election board member Julie Adams refused to certify primary election results after she filed a lawsuit backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute that argues county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. The rule the board adopted Tuesday was proposed by Michael Heekin, the other Republican-appointed member of the Fulton County board.\n\nHeekin on Tuesday rebutted claims that reasonable is a subjective term, saying it has an established legal meaning.\n\n\"It\u00b4s guardrails to make the point that what we are doing is very important and it\u00b4s not to be taken lightly,\" Heekin told the state board.\n\nBut Democrats and voting rights groups fear that Republicans on the board are laying the groundwork for Trump to dispute a Kamala Harris victory in Georgia.\n\n\"I\u00b4m saying that adopting a rule that\u00b4s inconsistent with the statute and over 100 years of Georgia Supreme Court precedent is outside the authority of the board,\" said Nikhel Sus, a lawyer for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning group that focuses on government ethics and accountability.\n\nTuesday's action comes after a trio of Republican partisans aligned with Trump took control of the five-member regulatory board. It has no direct role in determining election results, but writes rules to ensure that elections run smoothly and hears complaints about violations.\n\nTrump himself praised those members during a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, saying the three \"are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,\" but criticizing the Democrat on the board and the nonpartisan chairman appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp, saying they \"aren't so good.\" Trump in particular singled out Johnston, a retired obstetrician and frequent critic of elections in deeply Democratic Fulton County, who was in the second row at Saturday's rally and stood to acknowledge Trump's praise.\n\n\"My courage was contagious?\" Trump said after Johnston stood. \"Well, your courage is contagious, too.\"\n\nCritics of the board\u00b4s entanglement with Trump and Republican Party politics argue that it\u00b4s not just unseemly, but may be violating the board\u00b4s own code of conduct, which says members of the board \"shall be honest, fair, and avoid any appearance of conflict and/or impropriety.\"\n\nBoard member Janelle King, whose appointment cemented control to the Trump-aligned faction, denied that she's unduly influenced by her party. State Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon recently emailed proposed rules and talking points to the third member of the faction, former state Sen. Rick Jeffares.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t make decisions based on what side of the aisle wants me to do something,\" King told reporters. \"I look at the facts, I look at the evidence, I look at what\u00b4s in front of me, and I see if this is a good rule.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A crowd of mostly Republican voters at the meeting cheered when the rule passed.\n\nThe rule goes into effect immediately, 91 days before Trump faces presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\nVoting rights advocates said the rule provides a justification for election deniers on county boards to delay or deny certification if their preferred candidate loses.\n\nRepublican supporters of the rule said county election boards shouldn't just put a \"rubber stamp\" on election results without knowing they were accurate.\n\n\"If elections are conducted fairly and legally and accurately, most of the time, they are certified. So it's not the end of the world,\" Republican State Election Board member Janice Johnston said. \"We're not asking the board to do a full election audit or a forensic audit. We're just asking for a reasonable inquiry.\"\n\nBut the rule doesn't say what a \"reasonable inquiry\" includes, and several Republican election board members in Georgia have refused to certify recent elections, including during this year's primaries and last year's local elections. In each case, they were overridden by their board's majorities.\n\n\"The word 'reasonable' is inherently subjective. Georgia has 159 counties. What's reasonable to board members in one county may not be reasonable to members in another county,\" Nikhel Sus, an attorney for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told the board. \"This sort of open-ended language invites arbitrary and patchwork decision-making across counties.\"\n\nCertification is a required part of each election, a step that must be taken before counties can finalize results six days after an election.\n\nA county's failure to certify an election could throw the results into a dispute that would have to be settled by the courts before Georgia's statewide election certification deadline Nov. 22.\n\nThe rule was proposed by Michael Heekin, a Republican election board member in Fulton County who voted against certifying this year's presidential primary because he was concerned about ballot security.\n\n\"You have to look at how was the election run? Were there problems? Was it a carefree election or was it snakebit?\" Heekin told the state board. \"What's reasonable and what isn't depends upon the facts.\"\n\nState Election Board Chairman John Fervier opposed the rule because it lacked clear standards for a \"reasonable inquiry.\"\n\n\"I'm sympathetic to boards being able to look at documents prior to certifying,\" said Fervier, an appointee of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \"I also believe there should be some guardrails around that. There don't appear to be any guardrails around that process.\"\n\nThe rule doesn't require a new state law, which still mandates certification as part of the election process.\n\nBut under the new rule, critics say, county election board members could vote against certifying elections if they felt an inquiry was inadequate or the results were in doubt.\n\n\"It allows for exploitation and not for actual participation in a thorough election canvass process,\" said Sara Tindall Ghazall, a Democratic appointee to the State Election Board who voted against the rule.\n\nState Election Board member Janelle King, one of the Republicans celebrated by Trump as \"pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,\" said the former president's comments didn't influence her decisions.\n\n\"There's a lack of confidence in our election process,\" King said. \"If I'm going to ask a county election worker to sign their name on a legal document saying this is accurate, when in fact, they may see that there's some discrepancies ... then we're setting them up for failure.\"\n\nGeorgia certification definition\n\n\"'Certify the result of a primary, election, or runoff,' or words to that effect, means to attest, after reasonable inquiry, that the tabulation and canvassing of the election are complete and accurate and that the results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in that election.\"", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This would essentially give the partisan county election board personal control over Georgia's election results, allowing them to uphold the certification of the election if they disagree with the results.\"\n\nThe rule comes into effect after 20 days, but can be challenged in court.\n\nIt is a new battle over what has long been an administrative side issue, state and local governments certifying the resultsWith 90 days left in the presidential campaign, there could be more fighting in states where the differences are small.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his allies have tried block certification to prevent the election results from being finalized if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on the Michigan Board of Elections, which must certify ballots before state officials can declare a winner, briefly hesitated to sign off before one gave in and became the deciding vote. Trump had welcomed the delay as part of his attempt to his loss which ultimately culminated in the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol.\n\nDuring the 2022 midterm elections, several conservative, rural districts attempted to suspend their state election results, citing the same reason Debunked Claims of Voter Fraud that Trump made.\n\nIn Georgia, state officials were required to require rural Coffee County to certify in 2020. In May, Julie Adams, the Republican-appointed election board member for Fulton County, refused to certify primary results after she filed a lawsuit backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute arguing that county election board members have the authority to deny certification. The rule the board adopted Tuesday was proposed by Michael Heekin, the other Republican appointee to the Fulton County Board.\n\nHeekin on Tuesday refuted the claim that \"reasonable\" is a subjective term, arguing that it has an established legal meaning.\n\n\"These are measures to make it clear that what we are doing is very important and that we should not take it lightly,\" Heekin told the State Council.\n\nBut Democrats and voting rights groups fear that Republicans in the administration are laying the groundwork for Trump to challenge Kamala Harris' victory in Georgia.\n\n\"I say that adopting a rule that violates the law and over 100 years of Georgia Supreme Court case law is beyond the board's authority,\" said Nikhel Sus, an attorney with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning group focused on government ethics and accountability.\n\nTuesday's action follows a trio of Republican partisans Trump-aligned Republican Rep. took control of the five-member regulatory board, which has no direct role in determining election outcomes but writes rules to ensure the election runs smoothly and hears complaints about violations.\n\nTrump himself praised those members during a meeting in Atlanta on Saturday, saying the three are \"all pit bulls fighting for fairness, transparency and victory,\" but criticizing the Democrat on the board and the nonpartisan chairman appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp, saying they \"aren't that good.\" Trump singled out Johnston, a retired gynecologist and frequent critic of elections in heavily Democratic Fulton County, who sat in the second row at Saturday's rally and rose to acknowledge Trump's praise.\n\n\"My courage was contagious?\" Trump said after Johnston stood up. \"Well, your courage is contagious, too.\"\n\nCritics of the council's entanglement with Trump and Republican Party politics argue that it is not only inappropriate but also potentially inconsistent with the council's own code of conduct, which states that council members \"must be honest and fair and avoid any appearance of conflict and/or impropriety.\"\n\nBoard member Janelle King, whose appointment tightened control over the Trump-aligned faction, denied that she was unduly influenced by her party. State Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon recently emailed proposed rules and talking points to the faction's third member, former state Sen. Rick Jeffares.\n\n\"I don't make decisions based on which side of the aisle wants me to do something,\" King told reporters. \"I look at the facts, I look at the evidence, I look at what's in front of me, and I look at whether this is a good rule.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They're doing a great job, three members: Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King,\" Trump said. \"Three people are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.\"\n\nThose three Republicans attempted to approve election rules during a hastily called meeting last month without the board's other two members -- Republican Chairman John Fervier and Democrat Sara Tindall Ghazal. The board later voted unanimously to redo its votes following a lawsuit alleging the meeting violated the Georgia Open Meetings Act.\n\nThe meeting Tuesday is expected to attract hundreds of Republican voters who pack State Election Board meetings to cheer and boo proposals as they demand action ahead of this year's presidential contest.\n\nAs Trump continues to falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen, Republican voters have responded by swarming State Election Board meetings with complaints about Georgia's elections. The board has previously dismissed many allegations from the 2020 election, including cases of drop box ballot-stuffing and ineligible voters.\n\nRepublican legislators have made changes to election laws each year to address concerns by Trump and their constituents, including setting limits on drop boxes, requiring more voter ID, adding a ban on non governmental election funding and expanding voter eligibility challenges.\n\nVoting rights groups oppose the proposed rule that calls for a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying election results, saying it could be misused by partisan election board members to reject the results of the presidential race.\n\n\"The Trump-aligned Georgia election board members are working to change the state's election rules with less than 100 days until the election,\" Fair Fight Action spokesman Max Flugrath said on X. \"Here in Georgia, we're watching as Trump and his allies prepare to sabotage the 2024 election by changing the rules around certification election results.\"\n\nOther rule proposals under consideration would give greater access to election observers, require election workers to hand-count the number of ballots after polls closed to ensure accuracy, and conduct recounts by hand instead of machine.\n\nThe board is also reviving one of the last investigations of the 2020 election: a case alleging that Fulton County double-counted over 3,000 ballots during a recount.\n\nThe counting errors didn't change the outcome of the close election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, but Republican board members have said they wanted more accountability from Fulton beyond a reprimand issued in May.\n\nThe board plans to vote on a proposal for election monitors to watch Fulton's election this year, but it's unclear whether it will pass amid disagreement over who should serve on the observation team.\n\nFulton's election board has already signed off on the monitoring plan, which was a condition for resolving the double-counting case. The board previously conducted a performance review of Fulton's election management that recommended against a state takeover, finding that the county has made improvements since 2020.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Fight_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fair Fight Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/300/30089/3008966.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The three board members who voted for it - Dr Janice Johnson, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King - were praised by name three days ago by Donald Trump at an Atlanta campaign rally.\n\nThe rule was proposed by Michael Heekin, a Republican-appointee to the Fulton election board who refused to certify the presidential primary earlier this year. The rule requires local boards to initiate a \"reasonable inquiry\" when discrepancies emerge at a poll, and gives the power to withhold certification until that inquiry was completed. It does not define the term reasonable inquiry, nor does it establish strict limitations on the breadth of an inquiry.\n\nThe new rule essentially makes the certification of election results discretionary, said Democratic state representative Sam Park at a press conference outside of the hearing room at the Georgia capitol.\n\n\"These are Maga certification rules, and they're in direct conflict with Georgia law, which states in multiple places that local elections board officials shall perform their duties, meaning their duties are mandatory, not discretionary,\" Park said.\n\nRelated: How Georgia state election board's proposed rules make it easier to challenge results\n\nDebate on the rule centered on how much power state law and court precedent grants to the state board of elections to set rules for local boards. Georgia supreme court case law describes the role of elections supervisors as ministerial with little discretion to declare a vote valid or invalid, said Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington DC.\n\n\"It is contrary to settled Georgia law and would exceed this court's rule making authority,\" Sus said. The law requires disputes about a vote to be resolved with investigations by district attorneys, courts and other bodies, he said.\n\nBoard members in support of the rule say that local elections supervisors are required to sign an affidavit declaring that the results of an election are accurate and correct, and that rules should permit elections boards the power to determine the truth of that statement for themselves.\n\nThe rule is likely to draw an immediate legal challenge so close to an election.\n\n\"By supporting this rule, we are saying that 90 days before the election is not insufficient time,\" said Democratic board member Sara Tindall Ghazal.\n\n\"I think by supporting this rule, what we're saying is that we stand with those who have to sign legal documents stating that this information is accurate, and ensuring that they have what's necessary to stand by that legal document,\" replied King, a Republican board member.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jeffares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Jeffares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Park", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Yahtzee", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_uk_429/a05b15eef5f47c43bf32526838e7d5d8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Georgia Democrats like Ghazal say the new rule could potentially delay certification of the results in the upcoming general election if a county's election board chooses to do so.\n\n\"The actions by the Georgia State Election Board today threaten Georgia's time-tested checks and balances that we all rely on for fair, accurate, and secure election results. Georgia already has rigorous processes in place to verify, count, and review every ballot - and audit those results - prior to certification,\" Voting Rights Lab Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Sam Tarazi said in a statement.\n\nTarazi said the rule could result in \"unknowable delays in future elections at the behest of a single individual,\" adding: \"It flies in the face of the strong checks and balances that have been in place for Georgia's elections for decades.\"\n\nThe vote passed 3-2, with board Chairman John Fervier crossing party lines to vote alongside Ghazal opposing the rule. Fervier was appointed as chairman of the board by Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this year.\n\nDuring the heavily attended public hearing Tuesday, the board also passed - in a 3-1 vote along party lines - a motion to increase the number of poll watchers who are allowed to observe the tabulation process in Georgia's 159 counties. It also unanimously voted against a renewed effort to introduce new rules for hand-marked paper ballots in time for November's election to prevent possible vulnerabilities.\n\nThe hearing proved an animated scene with supporters of former President Donald Trump in attendance cheering on public comments and the eventual vote supporting the rule changes.\n\nDuring his rally on Saturday, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, offered his support for the three previously low-profile Republicans on the five-member board. The name-check renewed concerns among Democrats that the Republican-majority state election board is inserting partisanship in politics.\n\nAmong those Trump mentioned by name was Dr. Janice Johnston, whose board work he recognized, drawing an ovation from the crowd.\n\nJohnston was met with loud applause from some in the room during Tuesday's meeting when she said she thought the board \"should be able to see every single document in the election.\"\n\nRepublican board member Janelle King, who also voted for the rule, argued that county board members should not need to sign a document to certify results and should be allowed to review documents if they have outstanding questions.\n\nAhead of the meeting, King told CNN that the board's consideration of rule changes ahead of the general election is being done in good faith.\n\n\"This is about protecting all voters,\" King told CNN. \"I am making sure I am doing the right thing. I am appreciative of the president's support, but I am not working on behalf of anyone.\"\n\nShe said critics who are worried about potential interference by the Trump campaign is laughable.\n\n\"Saying our name and saying we're doing a good job doesn't mean anything. It just means we're doing a good job in his eyes,\" King said of Trump's rally mention.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was the chairman of the state's board during the 2020 election, called the panel \"a mess.\" His office would not offer additional comment.\n\n\"He's a mess,\" King said, reacting to Raffensperger's comments.\n\nTwo Republican former secretaries of state submitted a letter to the Georgia State Board of Elections on Tuesday cautioning that \"Recent last-minute rule/law changes and nontransparent tactics, like those introduced in Georgia, are unhelpful and may lead to additional public distrust of elections.\"\n\nGhazal told CNN her biggest concern is \"public confidence in the election,\" since, she said, the atmosphere created by entertaining potential rule changes ahead of November could put a cloud of doubt around Georgia's election that would be difficult to overcome.\n\nCNN's Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And the trio came under fire recently from a good government group for quietly holding a meeting without the other two members in an attempt to pass new election rules that would increase the number of partisan poll watchers.\n\n\"To the extent that Trump is that intimately aware of who is on the State Election Board and is championing them ... that should raise the alarm bells for everybody, said Chioma Chukwu, the interim executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit that pushes for government transparency. American Oversight said that partisan actors could use the proposed rule changes to sow chaos and confusion into the 2024 election.\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election in Georgia by about 12,000 votes, and famously pressured Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, to help overturn the election. Neither agreed.\n\n\"In my opinion, they want us to lose,\" Trump said of the two men at the Saturday rally. He also called Kemp \"a bad guy\" and \"a disloyal guy.\"\n\nThe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the Georgia Senate, the Georgia House of Representatives each appoint one of four-member Georgia State Election Board. The governor appoints the chair.\n\nThe majority that questions the 2020 election results came into power this year, when Jaffares and King joined Dr. Janice Johnston, a 2022 Republican Party appointee who advocated for another state investigation into the 2020 election.\n\nThe board is responsible for creating rules to administer the state's elections, and for years was chaired by the secretary of state, who is elected. But months after the 2020 election, the Republican-majority state legislature passed a sweeping election overhaul law that implemented stricter new rules about voting and overhauled the board.\n\nThe law removed Raffensperger as the board's chair, instead making the secretary of state an advisory member without voting power, and giving the legislature the power to appoint the chair. Raffensperger has been a target of Trump and his allies ever since Trump called him days after the election and asked him to \"find\" enough votes to declare him the winner, and Raffensperger declined. (He also defeated a Trump-backed challenger in the 2022 primary.)\n\nThe law also gave the Election Board more power, including the ability to suspend some local election administrators. Then, in 2024, the legislature passed and Kemp signed another election bill that removed the secretary of state altogether.\n\n\"Brad is directly accountable to the voters,\" Jordan Fuchs, deputy secretary of state, said of Raffensperger in a statement to USA TODAY. \"These unelected board members are not, which allows them to be politically leveraged and chased down by every wild internet conspiracy theory.\"\n\nIn January, the Georgia Senate, run by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, confirmed Rick Jeffares as that body's pick for the board. Jeffares posted memes shortly after the 2020 election \"that suggested dead people had voted by mail, claimed the Democrats and China had colluded, and implied that Democrats had cheated,\" according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. (Jones, the lieutenant governor, served as a fake member of the Electoral College, as part of Trump's effort to overturn the election.)\n\nIn May, the state House of Representatives confirmed King to replace Ed Lindsey, a Republican who faced criticism on the right for his support for no-excuse absentee voting and his lobbying career. King proposed re-opening a state investigation of the 2020 election.\n\nJaffres, Johnston and King met in July and hastily passed two election-related rules, but withdrew them after American Oversight sued alleging the members violated the state's Open Meetings Act.\n\nOne of the rules increased the number of partisan poll watchers to observe ballot counting, something that Chukwu of American Oversight said could increase the likelihood of intimidating election workers or having poll watchers observe personal information they're not supposed to see.\n\nThe other required county election boards to post daily ballot counts on their websites, something that Chukwu said Raffensperger's office already does.\n\n\"It's unclear the purpose of duplicating efforts that already exist, other than to provide individuals, partisan operatives, the ability to have a laser-focus in jurisdictions where they can decide they want to challenge voter registrations and votes,\" she said.\n\nAmerican Oversight alleged in its lawsuit the rules were unlawful because the members did not provide at least one week of advance notice; that the meeting did not involve a quorum of three people appearing in person because Johnston attended remotely; and did not provide teleconference access to the meeting for the general public.\n\nJeffares and Johnston didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmerican Oversight also said the three Republican board members went ahead with the July 12 meeting despite advance guidance from the Georgia Attorney General's office that the meeting would likely violate Georgia law. Kara Murray, the state Attorney General's office communications director, told USA TODAY the office can't speak about communications with the board because it represents the election board and therefore is constrained by attorney-client privilege.\n\nJanelle King, one of the board members Trump praised, told USA TODAY everything \"was conducted within legal limits as long as the majority of the board agreed to participate.\" However, \"in the spirit of board unity,\" they decided to redo the July 12 meeting and are now set to consider proposed rules Aug. 6.\n\nAccording to American Oversight's lawsuit, Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon emailed the text of the two proposed rules to Jeffares on July 8. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also reported it had documents showing McKoon sent Jeffares the proposed rules as well as talking points on why to adopt them.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party asked a court July 25 to participate in American Oversight's lawsuit against the board members, saying it also has an interest in how the litigation turns out.\n\nAsked by USA TODAY if anyone from the Republican Party or Trump campaign tried to influence or pressure her to pass the rules, King replied, \"Absolutely not!\" and that she simply read the petitions and decided based on the facts and evidence.\n\nTrump declared at the Saturday Atlanta rally that the three Republican board members were \"on fire\" -- riling some Democrats concerned about the integrity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"He's clearly in favor of their efforts to alter how elections are certified,\" Dave Hoffman, communications director for Georgia Democrats, told USA TODAY. He pointed to the state Republican Party's role in the proposed rules and talking points.\n\nKing said she didn't speak to anyone from the state party, the Trump campaign, or the Republican National Committee about the rules. Asked about Trump's praise for her, she said there is low confidence in elections across the political spectrum, and she wants to ensure Georgia voters can have confidence in the results.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party said it was seeking to intervene in the American Oversight litigation to ensure Georgia elections \"are devoid of any fraud, deceit, or abuse.\"", "source": {"uri":

Georgia Democrats like Ghazal say the new rule could potentially delay certification of the results in the upcoming general election if a county's election board chooses to do so.\n\n\"The actions by the Georgia State Election Board today threaten Georgia's time-tested checks and balances that we all rely on for fair, accurate, and secure election results. Georgia already has rigorous processes in place to verify, count, and review every ballot - and audit those results - prior to certification,\" Voting Rights Lab Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Sam Tarazi said in a statement.\n\nTarazi said the rule could result in \"unknowable delays in future elections at the behest of a single individual,\" adding: \"It flies in the face of the strong checks and balances that have been in place for Georgia's elections for decades.\"\n\nThe vote passed 3-2, with board Chairman John Fervier crossing party lines to vote alongside Ghazal opposing the rule. Fervier was appointed as chairman of the board by Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this year.\n\nDuring the heavily attended public hearing Tuesday, the board also passed - in a 3-1 vote along party lines - a motion to increase the number of poll watchers who are allowed to observe the tabulation process in Georgia's 159 counties. It also unanimously voted against a renewed effort to introduce new rules for hand-marked paper ballots in time for November's election to prevent possible vulnerabilities.\n\nThe hearing proved an animated scene with supporters of former President Donald Trump in attendance cheering on public comments and the eventual vote supporting the rule changes.\n\nDuring his rally on Saturday, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, offered his support for the three previously low-profile Republicans on the five-member board. The name-check renewed concerns among Democrats that the Republican-majority state election board is inserting partisanship in politics.\n\nAmong those Trump mentioned by name was Dr. Janice Johnston, whose board work he recognized, drawing an ovation from the crowd.\n\nJohnston was met with loud applause from some in the room during Tuesday's meeting when she said she thought the board \"should be able to see every single document in the election.\"\n\nRepublican board member Janelle King, who also voted for the rule, argued that county board members should not need to sign a document to certify results and should be allowed to review documents if they have outstanding questions.\n\nAhead of the meeting, King told CNN that the board's consideration of rule changes ahead of the general election is being done in good faith.\n\n\"This is about protecting all voters,\" King told CNN. \"I am making sure I am doing the right thing. I am appreciative of the president's support, but I am not working on behalf of anyone.\"\n\nShe said critics who are worried about potential interference by the Trump campaign is laughable.\n\n\"Saying our name and saying we're doing a good job doesn't mean anything. It just means we're doing a good job in his eyes,\" King said of Trump's rally mention.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was the chairman of the state's board during the 2020 election, called the panel \"a mess.\" His office would not offer additional comment.\n\n\"He's a mess,\" King said, reacting to Raffensperger's comments.\n\nTwo Republican former secretaries of state submitted a letter to the Georgia State Board of Elections on Tuesday cautioning that \"Recent last-minute rule/law changes and nontransparent tactics, like those introduced in Georgia, are unhelpful and may lead to additional public distrust of elections.\"\n\nGhazal told CNN her biggest concern is \"public confidence in the election,\" since, she said, the atmosphere created by entertaining potential rule changes ahead of November could put a cloud of doubt around Georgia's election that would be difficult to overcome.\n\nCNN's Dianne Gallagher

The board's three other Republicans -- Dr. Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King -- voted to pass the rule, making it official. Jeffares and Johnston are Trump-supporting election deniers, , as I reported here at American Doom and for the Guardian.\n\nThe rule makes mass certification refusals not just a possibility, but a likelihood. Across the country, almost 70 pro-Trump election deniers work as local election officials. Twenty-two of those officials have refused to certify election results in recent years, signaling that the practice is a key part of Republican plans to call November's results into question. In Georgia alone, at least 22 election deniers sit on county election boards, American Doom has found.\n\nThe new certification rule passed Tuesday was proposed by Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton County elections board in Atlanta. It gives county election board members like Heekin the discretion to withhold certification of election results if board members decide a \"reasonable inquiry\" is necessary to approve final results. The vague phrase provides a massive vacuum in which election deniers can insert specious allegations of fraud or calls to investigate election irregularities as rationale to refuse to certify election results.\n\nOpponents to the rule argued that using mass certification refusals -- the inevitable result of the \"reasonable inquiry\" justification -- will cause \"chaos and confusion\" as results roll in across Georgia's 159 counties, followed quickly by deadlines for counties to certify.\n\nNikhel Sus, a lawyer for Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility (CREW) in Washington, told the board in great detail that courts have repeatedly decided that certification is a \"ministerial\" task, as made evident by Georgia Supreme Court decisions dating back to 1899.\n\nStill, Dr. Janice Johnston, a pro-Trump election denier who accepted Trump's praise at his rally in Atlanta on Saturday and gleefully waved to the adoring crowd, claimed that elections held without this rule would be \"no better than an election in Venezuela or Russia.\"\n\n\"The term reasonable is so subjective,\" Sus said. \"There's not time to test out this rule before the election, so this is it. The results could be pretty bad.\"\n\nThe board -- or more accurately, its MAGA wing of Johnston, Jeffares and King -- ignored the pleas of a dozen or so state senators and representatives, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the left-leaning voting rights organization Fair Fight and many others who opposed the rule.\n\n\"Certification -- or the withholding of certification -- of election results has become a weapon in\n\nthe arsenal of those who wish to deny the validity of our elections,\" Fair Fight said in a letter asking the board to dismiss the rule.\n\nThe rule turns certification from a ministerial duty to a discretionary one -- in conflict with what election experts and lawyers across the country have said about certification in recent years. Since 2020, pro-Trump Republican election officials at the local level have refused to certify results at least 25 times in at least eight states. Those instances of certification refusal include two this year alone in Fulton County, where Heekin's colleague, the election denier Julie Adams, has refused to certify results and abstained from a vote on certification based on her demands for detailed election data.\n\nNow, with just 90 days until the election, local election officials who were already pursuing policies based on their beliefs in Trump's election lies, have a new weapon in their efforts to secure Georgia for Trump. Whereas certification refusals were previously rare, Georgia is likely to see many, many more instances of local election denial officials refusing to certify election results.\n\nThe victims of this new rule will not be Republicans.\n\nThe rule gives \"tools to subvert this ministerial duty, likely to the detriment of Black voters,\" Dillon Jules of the NAACP LDF told the SEB.\n\nKing, the board's lone Black member, took issue with that.\n\n\"I read this rule and as a Black woman I didn't see anything about it that would specifically disenfranchise Black voters,\" she said.\n\nThe reason this rule will disproportionately affect Black voters is simple: certification refusals will be employed by Republican county election board officials in blue counties, where their votes against certification will be seen as protest against false claims of Democrat voter fraud. Those claims will go viral and will be seized on by Trump and his allies in their efforts to question election results in Georgia and elsewhere.\n\n***\n\nP.S.

The three board members who voted for it - Dr Janice Johnson, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King - were praised by name three days ago by Donald Trump at an Atlanta campaign rally.\n\nThe rule was proposed by Michael Heekin, a Republican-appointee to the Fulton election board who refused to certify the presidential primary earlier this year. The rule requires local boards to initiate a \"reasonable inquiry\" when discrepancies emerge at a poll, and gives the power to withhold certification until that inquiry was completed. It does not define the term reasonable inquiry, nor does it establish strict limitations on the breadth of an inquiry.\n\nThe new rule essentially makes the certification of election results discretionary, said Democratic state representative Sam Park at a press conference outside of the hearing room at the Georgia capitol.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jeffares", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Jeffares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Park", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Trump have sought to grant local election officials more authority over the certification process.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Georgia State Election Board approved on Tuesday a measure that could empower local officials to refuse or delay certification of a county's election results, creating the potential for another disputed and contentious post-election period in November.\n\nThe new rule states that before certifying results, local officials may conduct \"reasonable inquiry\" that \"the results are a true and accurate accounting of all votes cast in that election.\"\n\nThough seemingly innocuous, the language implies that local election officials are awarded a level of discretion in the certification process, a suggestion that runs counter to decades of settled Georgia law delineating how results are officially certified. State law dictates that officials \"shall\" certify an election, making the process effectively ministerial; disputes over alleged fraud or major errors are typically left to recounts and courts.\n\nThe decision by the board worried Democrats and voting-rights advocates that the process could be weaponized if former President Donald J. Trump lost in November.\n\nAcross the country, conservative organizations and allies of Mr. Trump have sought to create new laws or win court rulings granting local officials more authority over the certification process. In Arizona, conservatives are targeting the state's election manual with several lawsuits. In Nevada, an official in the state's second-largest county refused to certify a recent election, setting up a legal test at the State Supreme Court.\n\nAnd in Georgia, even before the state election board's meeting on Tuesday, allies of Mr. Trump were seeking a similar resolution in the courts. In May, the America First Policy Institute filed a lawsuit on behalf of a member of the Fulton County, Ga., election board, arguing that she had the discretion to refuse certification and conduct an investigation because, as part of her oath, she had sworn to \"prevent fraud, deceit and abuse.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_Policy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "America First Policy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/multimedia/06pol-georgia-elections-top-jhbw/06pol-georgia-elections-top-jhbw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The three board members who voted for it - Dr Janice Johnson, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King - were praised by name three days ago by Donald Trump at an Atlanta campaign rally.\n\nThe rule was proposed by Michael Heekin, a Republican-appointee to the Fulton election board who refused to certify the presidential primary earlier this year. The rule requires local boards to initiate a \"reasonable inquiry\" when discrepancies emerge at a poll, and gives the power to withhold certification until that inquiry was completed. It does not define the term reasonable inquiry, nor does it establish strict limitations on the breadth of an inquiry.\n\nThe new rule essentially makes the certification of election results discretionary, said Democratic state representative Sam Park at a press conference outside of the hearing room at the Georgia capitol.\n\n\"These are Maga certification rules, and they're in direct conflict with Georgia law, which states in multiple places that local elections board officials shall perform their duties, meaning their duties are mandatory, not discretionary,\" Park said.\n\nDebate on the rule centered on how much power state law and court precedent grants to the state board of elections to set rules for local boards. Georgia supreme court case law describes the role of elections supervisors as ministerial with little discretion to declare a vote valid or invalid, said Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington DC.\n\n\"It is contrary to settled Georgia law and would exceed this court's rule making authority,\" Sus said. The law requires disputes about a vote to be resolved with investigations by district attorneys, courts and other bodies, he said.\n\nBoard members in support of the rule say that local elections supervisors are required to sign an affidavit declaring that the results of an election are accurate and correct, and that rules should permit elections boards the power to determine the truth of that statement for themselves.\n\nThe rule is likely to draw an immediate legal challenge so close to an election.\n\n\"By supporting this rule, we are saying that 90 days before the election is not insufficient time,\" said Democratic board member Sara Tindall Ghazal.\n\n\"I think by supporting this rule, what we're saying is that we stand with those who have to sign legal documents stating that this information is accurate, and ensuring that they have what's necessary to stand by that legal document,\" replied Republican board member Janelle King.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_chidi@theguardian.com", "name": "George Chidi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jeffares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Jeffares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Park", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cee849b4448718213a202609d729880871b2dcdc/0_103_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1fd72b44566448e0e45bca3e8c8a8625", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793211", "eventUri": "eng-9793211", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

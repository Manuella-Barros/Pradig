This group is accused of orchestrating a scheme to subvert the state's election results by submitting...\n\nWASHINGTON -- In the hours after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Ohio's then-Republican senator, Rob Portman, voted to accept President Joe Biden's win over the defeated former president, Donald Trump, despite Trump's false allegations that Biden won because of fraud.\n\nBut as Trump charges toward his rematch with Biden in 2024, Portman has been replaced by Sen. JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that tracks election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Tried to 'Corrupt' the 2016 Election, Prosecutor Alleges as ...\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that tracks election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election.

It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?' I think what some people are arguing is if there's things wrong with this election, we're going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType":

J.D. Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Expect to see AI 'weaponized to deceive voters' in this year's presidential election\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\n\" READ MORE: How voters can avoid deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation in the 2024 presidential election\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that targets election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Biden is struggling in Pa. -- even with his base -- as voters prefer Trump on major issues. Here are takeaways from an Inquirer/NYT/Siena poll.\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\n\" READ MORE: Wildwood rally shows Trump's base has only grown louder and prouder since 2016\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\n\" READ MORE: Trump voters care about the economy, Biden voters about abortion? It's not that simple.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?' I think what some people are arguing is if there's things wrong with this election, we're going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots.

It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker.

Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?'

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that tracks election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?' I think what some people are arguing is if there's things wrong with this election, we're going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Election laws being put into place in Republican-controlled states have nothing to do with integrity and everything to do with denying citizens their right to vote and intimidating election officials and volunteers.\n\nThe second most crucial Republican policy after cutting taxes for the already wealthy has long been to make voting more difficult for populations that tend to vote Democratic. They accomplished this in recent decades by gerrymandering, limiting polling places and hours, using scare tactics and dishing out election disinformation.\n\nNow, the MAGA party insists on further cheating its way to permanent minority rule by denigrating the idea that voting can be fair -- if the other side wins.\n\nIf the idea that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election -- which he won by more than 7 million votes, with a 306-232 electoral vote victory -- is Trump's big lie, then Republican efforts to ensure \"election integrity\" around the country are lies metastasizing from the malignant tumor Trump introduced into our democracy. Trump's con about election fraud is intended to succeed where his multifaceted effort to overturn the 2020 election failed.\n\nLed by disgraced attorney and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani -- who claimed the election was stolen way back in 1989, when he lost his first mayoral race against Democratic incumbent David Dinkins -- the Trump campaign brought 62 lawsuits claiming some kind of voter fraud or voting improprieties in the 2020 election. Trump's apparatchiks lost 61 of those, either because they lacked standing to sue or because they had no real evidence to offer. (As actual attorneys involved no doubt understood, presenting false evidence in court of law can get you in serious trouble.) Oh, and that one case they won, in Pennsylvania? It was about whether voters should be allowed to correct the identification on their ballot within three days of the election, and did not affect the outcome.\n\nNo evidence of significant voter fraud has existed in any recent American election. The most noteworthy instances in recent years have involved individual Republicans attempting to cast false votes, probably because Fox News-style propagandists and right-wing politicians tell them every day that Democrats are cheating.\n\nAs usual for Trumpists, every accusation is an admission. Who cheats at elections? You might ask the phony Republican electors charged in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada, or the 10 Republicans who admitted to what they did in the Wisconsin civil case. Ask the 11 phony electors indicted in Arizona, along with officials in the Trump White House who urged them to cheat the American people.\n\nYou might ask Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who has been indicted both in Arizona and in Georgia for trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election. Meadows demanded an end to election fraud and, oh yeah, also registered to vote in three states.\n\nSince 2021, more than half the states have passed new \"election integrity\" laws that place more responsibilities and potential liabilities on poll workers. Republicans are now bragging or threatening about how many poll watchers they are training to contest all aspects of the upcoming election in swing states. To borrow one of Trump's con-man locutions, everybody knows this announcement is about scaring voters away and undermining the public's trust in elections.\n\nI could pause a moment here to mention that a man came up to me the other day -- big man, strong man -- with tears welling up in his eyes, and he asked me, \"Kirk, sir, why do Republican-controlled legislatures pass laws about election integrity when there has been no evidence of voter fraud?\" (Well, I \"could\" mention it -- but I won't, because it didn't happen. Just as it never happens to Trump.)\n\nTrump has been talking up voter fraud since before the 2016 election, claiming at rallies that the only way he can lose is if the other side cheats, repeating the lie to brainwash his followers. Every legitimate study of elections in the U.S. has shown that it's nearly impossible to cast a false ballot without getting caught.\n\nWhile there's vanishingly little fraud in voting, Trump's brand is fraud:\n\nSince leaving the White House, Trump has been indicted in four venues on 88 felony counts. He lost two civil cases for sexually assaulting and then defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, and another civil case for fraudulent financial statements in New York. Judges have repeatedly issued gag orders against Trump, because he cannot stop himself from publicly criticizing witnesses, jurors, prosecutors and the judges themselves, putting them in harm's way. (As I recently wrote, we could use a nationwide gag order on Trump's calls for violence against others.)\n\nParroting Trump, an increasing number of Republicans are refusing to say whether they will accept the results of this year's presidential election. Even some slightly saner Republicans are saying that MAGA-friendly members of Congress are spouting Russian propaganda. I've contended for years that if Trump isn't working for Vladimir Putin, he might as well be. But that also applies to an unknown number of Republicans in Congress, not just Marjorie Taylor Greene and her friends on the far-right fringe.\n\nAs Anne Applebaum writes in her new book \"Autocracy, Inc.,\" recently excerpted in The Atlantic, autocrats around the globe are banding together with MAGA Republicans to manipulate people into believing that democracies cannot work:\n\nMeanwhile, threats against election officials continue. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that \"large numbers of election officials report having experienced threats, abuse, or harassment for doing their jobs\" and that those officials have taken steps since the 2020 election to secure the safety of staff and volunteers.\n\nWhen Republicans talk about fighting for election integrity, you know the opposite is true. By buying into Trump's lies about elections, Republicans are cheating the rest of us. As a pathological narcissist (as well as the world's biggest crybaby), Trump cannot allow himself to admit defeat, and Republicans are willing to tear the country apart to appease his toddler-like tantrums.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nRepublican propaganda around voting happens so often that another glaring example occurred within the last week, while I was finishing this article. House Speaker Mike Johnson held a press conference to announce a bill that would keep non-citizens from voting. But since it's already illegal for non-citizens to vote, journalists immediately called him out on it.\n\nMedia outlets must strive not to repeat any Republican permutation of \"election integrity\" and must patiently spell out the truth again and again -- and then again, as tiresome as that may be. They should also report on the larger Republican effort to undermine confidence in elections, pass more rules that make it harder for Democratic constituencies to vote and intimidate those voters who show up anyway.\n\nWhile the Biden administration is doing what it can to promote voting, Republicans are working diligently to create the illusion that they support free and fair elections, all while creating a system of roadblocks and intimidation. They hope to create a system where voting takes place but the outcome is guaranteed. Trump and his enablers have taken that even further by claiming the only way they can lose is if the other side cheats.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

J.D. Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump\u00b4s false claims of fraud and said he\u00b4ll accept the results this fall only \"if it\u00b4s a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden\u00b4s victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November\u00b4s election, Republicans won\u00b4t stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump\u00b4s failed legal challenge to Biden\u00b4s win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that targets election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump\u00b4s bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\nFILE - Supporters of President Donald Trump hold signs as they stand outside of the Clark County Elections Department in North Las Vegas,Nov. 7, 2020. As former President Donald Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File)\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who\u00b4ve shown they\u00b4re not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That\u00b4s the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump\u00b4s direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that\u00b4s true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden\u00b4s victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate - one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president\u00b4s Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it\u00b4s hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it\u00b4s lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?\u00b4 I think what some people are arguing is if there\u00b4s things wrong with this election, we\u00b4re going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.\n\nFILE - Rioters loyal to President Donald Trump rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win.

It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nHow the feds say they caught one of St. Louis' most prolific cocaine distributors TV Q&A: Where to find the 'Monk' movie Sonny Gray expected the manager to come get him.

Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\n0 Comments Tags Wire Dcc Lee-national", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com",

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who echoes Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but are less committal this year.\n\nThe new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Several more hope to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ulmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has parroted Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nThere was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 13 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\n\nIt finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

J.D. Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that targets election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?' I think what some people are arguing is if there's things wrong with this election, we're going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He emerged promising House legislation designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a news conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nTexas elections officials shoulder new burdens to appease ballot-security skeptics

J.D. Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that targets election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.\n\n\"When people ask me, 'Are you going to accept the outcome?' I think what some people are arguing is if there's things wrong with this election, we're going to point it out,\" Rubio said in a short interview.\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_riccardi@thestar.com", "name": "Nicholas Riccardi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Election laws being put into place in Republican-controlled states have nothing to do with integrity and everything to do with denying citizens their right to vote and intimidating election officials and volunteers.\n\nThe second most crucial Republican policy after cutting taxes for the already wealthy has long been to make voting more difficult for populations that tend to vote Democratic. They accomplished this in recent decades by gerrymandering, limiting polling places and hours, using scare tactics and dishing out election disinformation.\n\nNow, the MAGA party insists on further cheating its way to permanent minority rule by denigrating the idea that voting can be fair -- if the other side wins.\n\nIf the idea that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election -- which he won by more than 7 million votes, with a 306-232 electoral vote victory -- is Trump's big lie, then Republican efforts to ensure \"election integrity\" around the country are lies metastasizing from the malignant tumor Trump introduced into our democracy. Trump's con about election fraud is intended to succeed where his multifaceted effort to overturn the 2020 election failed.\n\nLed by disgraced attorney and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani -- who claimed the election was stolen way back in 1989, when he lost his first mayoral race against Democratic incumbent David Dinkins -- the Trump campaign brought 62 lawsuits claiming some kind of voter fraud or voting improprieties in the 2020 election. Trump's apparatchiks lost 61 of those, either because they lacked standing to sue or because they had no real evidence to offer. (As actual attorneys involved no doubt understood, presenting false evidence in court of law can get you in serious trouble.) Oh, and that one case they won, in Pennsylvania? It was about whether voters should be allowed to correct the identification on their ballot within three days of the election, and did not affect the outcome.\n\nNo evidence of significant voter fraud has existed in any recent American election. The most noteworthy instances in recent years have involved individual Republicans attempting to cast false votes, probably because Fox News-style propagandists and right-wing politicians tell them every day that Democrats are cheating.\n\nAs usual for Trumpists, every accusation is an admission. Who cheats at elections? You might ask the phony Republican electors charged in Michigan, Georgia and Nevada, or the 10 Republicans who admitted to what they did in the Wisconsin civil case. Ask the 11 phony electors indicted in Arizona, along with officials in the Trump White House who urged them to cheat the American people.\n\nYou might ask Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who has been indicted both in Arizona and in Georgia for trying to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election. Meadows demanded an end to election fraud and, oh yeah, also registered to vote in three states.\n\nSince 2021, more than half the states have passed new \"election integrity\" laws that place more responsibilities and potential liabilities on poll workers. Republicans are now bragging or threatening about how many poll watchers they are training to contest all aspects of the upcoming election in swing states. To borrow one of Trump's con-man locutions, everybody knows this announcement is about scaring voters away and undermining the public's trust in elections.\n\nI could pause a moment here to mention that a man came up to me the other day -- big man, strong man -- with tears welling up in his eyes, and he asked me, \"Kirk, sir, why do Republican-controlled legislatures pass laws about election integrity when there has been no evidence of voter fraud?\" (Well, I \"could\" mention it -- but I won't, because it didn't happen. Just as it never happens to Trump.)\n\nTrump has been talking up voter fraud since before the 2016 election, claiming at rallies that the only way he can lose is if the other side cheats, repeating the lie to brainwash his followers. Every legitimate study of elections in the U.S. has shown that it's nearly impossible to cast a false ballot without getting caught.\n\nWhile there's vanishingly little fraud in voting, Trump's brand is fraud:\n\nSince leaving the White House, Trump has been indicted in four venues on 88 felony counts. He lost two civil cases for sexually assaulting and then defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll, and another civil case for fraudulent financial statements in New York. Judges have repeatedly issued gag orders against Trump, because he cannot stop himself from publicly criticizing witnesses, jurors, prosecutors and the judges themselves, putting them in harm's way. (As I recently wrote, we could use a nationwide gag order on Trump's calls for violence against others.)\n\nParroting Trump, an increasing number of Republicans are refusing to say whether they will accept the results of this year's presidential election. Even some slightly saner Republicans are saying that MAGA-friendly members of Congress are spouting Russian propaganda. I've contended for years that if Trump isn't working for Vladimir Putin, he might as well be. But that also applies to an unknown number of Republicans in Congress, not just Marjorie Taylor Greene and her friends on the far-right fringe.\n\nAs Anne Applebaum writes in her new book \"Autocracy, Inc.,\" recently excerpted in The Atlantic, autocrats around the globe are banding together with MAGA Republicans to manipulate people into believing that democracies cannot work:\n\nThis is the core problem for autocracies: The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and others all know that the language of transparency, accountability, justice, and democracy appeals to some of their citizens, as it does to many people who live in dictatorships. Even the most sophisticated surveillance can't wholly suppress it. The very ideas of democracy and freedom must be discredited -- especially in the places where they have historically flourished.\n\nMeanwhile, threats against election officials continue. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that \"large numbers of election officials report having experienced threats, abuse, or harassment for doing their jobs\" and that those officials have taken steps since the 2020 election to secure the safety of staff and volunteers.\n\nWhen Republicans talk about fighting for election integrity, you know the opposite is true. By buying into Trump's lies about elections, Republicans are cheating the rest of us. As a pathological narcissist (as well as the world's biggest crybaby), Trump cannot allow himself to admit defeat, and Republicans are willing to tear the country apart to appease his toddler-like tantrums.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nRepublican propaganda around voting happens so often that another glaring example occurred within the last week, while I was finishing this article. House Speaker Mike Johnson held a press conference to announce a bill that would keep non-citizens from voting. But since it's already illegal for non-citizens to vote, journalists immediately called him out on it.\n\nMedia outlets must strive not to repeat any Republican permutation of \"election integrity\" and must patiently spell out the truth again and again -- and then again, as tiresome as that may be. They should also report on the larger Republican effort to undermine confidence in elections, pass more rules that make it harder for Democratic constituencies to vote and intimidate those voters who show up anyway.\n\nWhile the Biden administration is doing what it can to promote voting, Republicans are working diligently to create the illusion that they support free and fair elections, all while creating a system of roadblocks and intimidation. They hope to create a system where voting takes place but the outcome is guaranteed. Trump and his enablers have taken that even further by claiming the only way they can lose is if the other side cheats.\n\nAs Timothy Snyder writes in \"On Tyranny\":", "source": {"uri": "salon.com",

But heading toward the Nov. 4 presidential election, Republican officials are grappling with their answers -- hoping on the one hand not to miff former President Donald Trump, who for the past four years has said the 2020 contest was stolen from him, while at the same time hoping to avoid sounding unpatriotic by saying \"No.\"\n\nNational media over the past two weeks have been tracking down Republican officials to ask that question and have met with dodges, nonanswers and silence -- about anything other than an unambiguous commitment to support the results regardless of who wins.\n\nFor instance, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican frequently named as a possible Trump running mate, was asked repeatedly on NBC's \"Meet the Press\", and declined to say he would accept the election results. He allowed only that Trump would be elected.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican who is another possible Trump running mate, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that he'd accept the results if the election is \"free and fair.\"\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, the Florida Republican who took a leading role in trying to overturn the 2020 results, told The New York Times he would accept the results in 2024 as long local election officials \"follow election laws.\"\n\nMost of Louisiana's Republican delegation refused to answer the question: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson; Reps Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge; Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette; Julie Letlow, R-Start; and Sen. John N. Kennedy, R-Madisonville.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, of Baton Rouge, was one of the few Republicans who opposed challenges to the electoral college count and voted to support certification of President Joe Biden's win in 2020.\n\nHe was roundly criticized by Louisiana Republicans for that position and for voting to convict Trump on impeachment charges stemming from the Jan. 6 riot attempting to disrupt the certification. Trump in August wrote on his Truth Social media platform: \"One of the worst Senators in the United States Senate is, without question, Bill Cassidy, A TOTAL FLAKE, Republican though he may be.\"\n\nCassidy, who faces reelection in two years, said he would accept the results, \"if it's a free and fair election. Lindsey Graham says this and I agree with Lindsey, a free and fair election. ... His answer is the perfect answer.\"\n\nSen. Graham, R-South Carolina, said on \"Meet the Press,\" that he'd accept the election results if \"there's no massive cheating.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, referred to a statement his spokesperson gave The New York Times last week: \"The Speaker of the House has a duty to ensure each presidential election is conducted in compliance with the Constitution and all applicable laws, and to accept the results accordingly. Speaker Johnson will always adhere to the rule of law,\" said Taylor Haulsee, the speaker deputy communications chief.\n\nJohnson, who opposed certifying the electoral votes that elected Biden president in 2020, was the author of theory that the presidential election was flawed because some states did not receive the proper legislative approval when they changed voting procedures during the COVID pandemic. However, the case was dismissed in federal courts.\n\nJohnson also told the digital news site Politico that legally challenging election results were part of the process.\n\nThough immigration, crime, inflation are all key issues in the presidential contest, election denialism is playing a role. At a March 2 rally in Greensboro, N.C., Trump said of the 2020 election, \"82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election.\"\n\nTrump exaggerated, but not by much.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Republican voters say the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, according to several recent polls. The Washington Post interviewed primary voters who claimed rigged voting machines, fake voters and other massive fraud occurred, though Trump supporters lost more than 60 lawsuits claiming massive cheating.\n\nAs the Louisiana congressional delegation's only Democrat, Rep. Troy Carter, of New Orleans, couldn't pass up an opportunity to make Republicans uncomfortable.\n\n\"As an elected official committed to upholding our democratic values, I will accept the results of the presidential election regardless of the outcome,\" Carter said. \"It's essential for the stability and strength of our democracy that we respect the will of the voters and honor the outcome of our electoral process.\"", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_ballard@nola.com", "name": "Mark Ballard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Now, in 2024, Trump is the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and Congress -- according to the Associated -- is full of Republican lawmakers who have either falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen or won't commit to accepting the election results if Trump loses to Biden a second time in November.\n\nIn a report Tuesday, States United Action -- a group that goes after election deniers -- found that almost one-third of Congress members supported, in some fashion, Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nREAD MORE:The most important litmus test: Every election denier must pledge to certify the 2024 results\n\nAccording to States United Action, that includes \"151 election deniers\" in the U.S. House of Representatives and \"19 election deniers\" in the U.S. Senate.\n\nStates United Action's Lizzie Ullmer told AP, \"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people.\"\n\nWendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University is sounding the alarm as well.\n\nWeiser told AP, \"This is deeply alarming.

And House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), the AP reporters note, \"helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win.\"\n\n\"States United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks,\" the AP report states.\n\n\"It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat. The report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\"\n\nThe AP report adds, \"It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents.

Several GOP leaders and candidates have refused to answer, evaded the topic, reacted with nonanswers, or delivered blatant lies when asked if they accept the outcome this time around, as per The New York Times. Their evasive responses demonstrate how a fundamental element of American democracy -- that candidates are bound by the result -- has been undermined by the former President's apparent failure to accept his loss during the 2020 election. Here are seven such politicians.\n\nIn August 2023, during a Republican presidential primary discussion, Scott affirmed that former Vice President Mike Pence was right to certify the results on January 6, 2021. \"Absolutely, he did the right thing,\" Scott said then. Interestingly, more recently, Scott evaded eight efforts by Kristen Welker, the moderator of NBC's Meet the Press, when she tried to ascertain if he would accept the results of the upcoming election, regardless of who won. Welker's attempts came in the light of rumors that suggested Scott would be chosen as Trump's running mate. In the end, Scott steadfastly declined to say anything except to project a Trump win in November.\n\nJohnson voted against recognizing the election win of President Joe Biden in 2020. A representative for Johnson, Taylor Haulsee, discussed the outcomes of the 2024 election in a statement provided to The New York Times on Friday, 10 May. \"Speaker Johnson will always adhere to the rule of law. The speaker also recognizes the right of all candidates to contest election irregularities with litigation as appropriate.\" Johnson stated in previous interviews that he thought upholding the Constitution could entail contesting the outcome.\n\nElise Stefanik, a prospective running mate for Trump who holds the highest position in the House Republican leadership, has pledged to accept the results 'if they're constitutional.' The New York lawmaker said that the 2020 results were unlawful, citing modifications to voting laws in some states. \"What we saw in 2020 was unconstitutional circumventing of the Constitution, not going through state legislators when it comes to changing election law,\" she told Meet the Press. \"I see this at a very local level as well.\"\n\nIn an interview, Byron Donalds, a Republican from Florida who is on Trump's short list of possible running mates, said he would accept the outcome of the 2024 election if he believed it to be fair. Elaborating on his stance, Donalds added that this was not the case in 2020 when he played a pivotal role in Congress during the effort to void the presidential election. \"As long as localities follow election laws passed by the legislature...If the procedures are followed, I'm good,\" Donalds promised, adding that there shouldn't be any 'funny business.'\n\nIn response to a question about whether he would accept the results in 2024, J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican who is rumored to be on Trump's list for vice president, refused to comment. However, he stated that, in contrast to Vice President Pence in 2020, he would have supported Trump in his attempt to overturn the outcome. \"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states -- like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and so many others -- that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Vance told ABC News in February. \"That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020.\"\n\nSam Brown answered questions from The Las Vegas Review-Journal last week on election fraud and whether or not he would be prepared to accept the outcome of the 2024 elections. However, he failed to respond to the queries in detail. Instead, Brown reportedly replied by casting doubt on the security of the election, according to the publication. Instead of giving concrete instances of the vulnerabilities he saw, he alluded to Democratic state lawmakers who 'rammed through new laws that put ballots and election security at risk' in 2020. \"These last-minute changes caused many voters to lose confidence in our election systems,\" Brown said.\n\nTrump has had the fervent backing of Lindsey Graham, who has accompanied him on several campaign rallies. The South Carolina legislator responded in the affirmative when asked by journalist Welker if he would accept the results of the 2024 election, 'no matter who wins.' On NBC's Meet the Press, however, he cited certain restrictions, like many of his fellow GOP members. \"Yeah, I'll accept them if I think, you know, there's no massive cheating. I accepted 2020...Here's what I would say...President Trump is poised to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Welker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Welker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

JD Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\n...", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9581357", "eventUri": "eng-9581357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Ron Johnson won't pledge to accept result of 2024 presidential election", "body": "MADISON - U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is not pledging to accept the result of the November presidential election, leaving a door open to objecting to the certification of election results -- a scenario that prompted an attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago when former President Donald Trump lost reelection.\n\nJohnson told The Cap Times on Saturday he could not answer whether he would accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, calling it an \"impossible hypothetical.\"\n\n\"We have to see exactly what happens,\" Johnson said in an interview at the state Republican Party convention in Appleton. \"If there are all kinds of abuses, we might have to start questioning those abuses, might have to investigate them. I certainly want to (accept the results).\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Johnson did not immediately answer questions early Sunday about what kind of events could push Johnson to seek an investigation.\n\nMore: Wisconsin Republican leader says party may need to embrace absentee ballot drop boxes\n\nJohnson also hedged on accepting the results of the 2020 election four years ago amid heavy pressure leveled by Trump on Republicans to avenge his election loss despite a lack of evidence to support doing so.\n\nFollowing the election, Johnson initially accepted Trump's loss and said he had no plans to object to the certification in Congress. He later changed his mind and said on Jan. 6, 2021, he planned to be among about a dozen Republicans who would object to Joe Biden's electoral victory in some states. He later changed his mind again following the attack on the U.S. Capitol that day.\n\nTrump told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this month he would only accept the results if \"everything's honest.\"\n\n\"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But if everything's honest, which we anticipate it will be -- a lot of changes have been made over the last few years -- but if everything's honest, I will absolutely accept the results.\"\n\nHe offered similar conditions when asked the same question by news outlets in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump said in the interview he would \"let it be known\" if he thought something was wrong with the election.\n\n\"I'd be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise,\" he said. \"But no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big.\"\n\nThere's no evidence to support that Wisconsin's election was tainted by cheating or fraud in 2020. The results have been confirmed by recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties that Trump paid for, court rulings, a nonpartisan state audit and a study by the conservative legal firm Wisconsin Institute of Law & Liberty, among other analyses.\n\nIn 2016, Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Wisconsin in more than three decades -- a victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that pushed him into the presidency.\n\nIn 2020, however, Trump lost the state to Biden by just about 21,000 votes. Even so, Trump has falsely claimed the result was wrong and a result of widespread voter fraud -- a lie that has been repeatedly debunked since.\n\nAs in 2020, voters this fall will have a choice between Trump and Biden. Wisconsin is one of a handful of swing states expected to determine the outcome this fall.\n\nOn May 2, in response to Trump's comments to the Journal Sentinel, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden would accept election results without conditions.\n\n\"Like President Biden has previously committed, he will accept the will of the American people,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"That is a commitment from the president.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nAnd the new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win. He demurred when asked if he believed the 2020 election was legitimate during an event with other Trump allies about the upcoming election.\n\nAs Trump makes a comeback bid to return to power, Republicans in Congress have become even more likely to cast doubts on Biden's victory or deny it was legitimate, a political turnaround that allows his false claims of fraud to linger and lays the groundwork to potentially challenge the results in 2024.\n\nA new report released Tuesday by States United Action, a group that targets election deniers, said nearly one-third of the lawmakers in Congress supported in some way Trump's bid to overturn the 2020 results or otherwise cast doubt on the reliability of elections. Several more are hoping to join them, running for election this year to the House and Senate.\n\n\"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people,\" said Lizzie Ullmer of States United Action.\n\nThe issue is particularly stark for Congress given its constitutional role as the final arbiter of the validity of a presidential election. It counts the results from the Electoral College, as it set out to do on Jan. 6, 2021, a date now etched in history because of the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.\n\nIn its report, States United found that in Congress, 170 representatives and senators out of 535 lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers. Heading into the fall elections, two new Senate candidates and 17 new House candidates already are on the ballot this fall seeking to join them.\n\nIt's not just Congress that has been seeded with people who supported trying to overturn Trump's 2020 loss, but the highest ranks of the Republican Party.\n\n\"This is deeply alarming,\" said Wendy Weiser, the vice president for democracy programs at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nThe former president picked Michael Whatley, who has echoed Trump's election lies, to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, with his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Christina Bobb, who was recently indicted for her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit fake electors in Arizona, has been named the RNC's head of \"election integrity.\"\n\nUnder Trump's direction, the RNC is making the elections process its top priority, bringing in the new personnel and adding resources, said Danielle Alvarez, an adviser to both the Trump campaign and the party committee.\n\n\"Biden is in the White House, that's true,\" Alvarez said, \"but there were issues in the election.\"\n\nTo be clear, there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election that cost Trump reelection. Recounts, audits and reviews in the battleground states where he contested his loss all affirmed Biden's victory, and courts rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies.\n\nStates United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks. It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat.\n\nThe report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race. It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\n\nThere have been high-profile losses among election deniers, as well. Last week in West Virginia, Republican Rep. Carol Miller, who also voted against accepting Biden's victory, successfully fended off a primary challenge from Derrick Evans, who was convicted of a felony civil disorder charge after storming the Capitol on Jan. 6. Numerous election deniers in 2022 lost bids for swing state offices such as governor or secretary of state that would have given them direct power over voting in 2024.\n\nStill, the movement has grown by dominating Republican primaries. In the race for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, businessman Bernie Moreno, who has previously said Trump was \"right\" to call 2020 \"stolen,\" won his primary. In Indiana, Republican Sen. Mike Braun voted to certify Biden's win, but he will step down this year to run for governor and is poised to be replaced by Rep. Jim Banks, a prominent election denier who easily won the GOP primary in that state.\n\nThe report classifies neither Rubio or Scott as election deniers, but skepticism about the trustworthiness of voting has become an organizing GOP principle, particularly for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nBefore becoming the House speaker, Johnson recruited colleagues to support a lawsuit, which ultimately failed, filed by Trump's allies to overturn his 2020 loss.\n\nMore recently Johnson met with Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort to shore up his own political support amid a far-right rebellion seeking to oust him as speaker. He emerged promising House legislation that would be designed to stop immigrants in the country illegally from voting.\n\nDuring a press conference on the Capitol steps to announce the bill, the speaker acknowledged it's hard to prove that certain immigrants are wrongfully casting ballots. Election experts say it is extremely rare for immigrants who are ineligible to vote to break federal law to do so.\n\nWhile Congress passed legislation putting in safeguards to better protect against interference after the Capitol attack, it's lawmakers who will ultimately be asked to accept the 2024 results from their states.\n\nVance stood by his recent remarks. And Rubio said he expects there will be lawsuits in jurisdictions where the final tallies are close, as sometimes happens.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

And some of Trump's allies are up against criminal charges in an election interference case being prosecuted by Arizona State Attorney General Kris Mayes, including former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis and ex-Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nBut despite all those criminal indictments, many MAGA Republicans are declaring their commitment to \"election integrity\" -- a GOP talking point that journalist Kirk Swearingen urges fellow reporters to avoid in a biting article published by Salon on May 20.\n\n\"Can journalists please stop repeating the term 'election integrity' just because Republicans insist on saying it?\" Swearingen writes. \"Heck, if they don't offer credible evidence -- because there is none -- I wouldn't even quote Republicans when they use the term, at least not without setting the record straight.

J.D. Vance of Ohio in Palm Beach, Florida in July 2023 (Gage Skidmore)\n\nFour years ago, during the United States' 2020 presidential race, supporters of then-President Donald Trump accused \"Real Time\" host Bill Maher of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" when he predicted that Trump would not accept the election results if he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBut Trump, just as Maher predicted, refused to acknowledge that he lost the election. Now, in 2024, Trump is the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and Congress -- according to Associated Press (AP) reporters Nicholas Riccardi and Lisa Mascaro -- is full of Republican lawmakers who have either falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen or won't commit to accepting the election results if Trump loses to Biden a second time in November.\n\nIn a report released on Tuesday, May 21, States United Action -- a group that goes after election deniers -- found that almost one-third of Congress members supported, in some fashion, Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nREAD MORE: The most important litmus test: Every election denier must pledge to certify the 2024 results\n\nAccording to States United Action, that includes \"151 election deniers\" in the U.S. House of Representatives and \"19 election deniers\" in the U.S. Senate.\n\nStates United Action's Lizzie Ullmer told AP, \"The public should have a real healthy dose of concern about the real risk of having people in power who've shown they're not willing to respect the will of the people.\"\n\nWendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University is sounding the alarm as well.\n\nWeiser told AP, \"This is deeply alarming. A democracy can only function if the participants commit to accepting the results of popular elections. That is it. That's the entire political system.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Unified Reich': Biden campaign slams Trump for German slogan embedded in campaign video\n\nRiccardi and Mascaro cite specific examples of GOP lawmakers who haven't fully committed to accepting the 2024 presidential election results if Trump loses, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina). And House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), the AP reporters note, \"helped organize Trump's failed legal challenge to Biden's win.\"\n\n\"States United's report details how successful election deniers have been in bolstering their congressional ranks,\" Riccardi and Mascaro explain. \"It examines the results of congressional party primaries in the 10 states that have held them this year and found that in each state, at least one election denier has made it to the general election for a House or Senate seat. The report defines election deniers as people who falsely claimed Trump won in 2020, spread misinformation about that election or took steps to overturn it, or refused to concede a separate race.\"\n\nThe AP journalists add, \"It finds that at least 67 will be on the ballot in the House in November, including 50 incumbents. Three will be running for the Senate -- one of whom, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is an incumbent.\"\n\nREAD MORE:The Alito flag controversy 'makes an ugly situation worse': analysis", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump derangement syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Rather than cautioning everyone about British troops in red coats, however, they are sounding the alarm over men and women in red MAGA hats who the AP lumps into a category of \"election deniers.\" In the title of their article today, they claim that these diabolical election deniers are \"moving closer to [the] GOP mainstream.\" They aren't just talking about random voters out in the street, either. They lead off the parade of villains with Senators J.D. Vance, Tim Scott, and Marco Rubio.\n\nIn the hours after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Ohio's then-Republican senator, Rob Portman, voted to accept President Joe Biden's win over the defeated former president, Donald Trump, despite Trump's false allegations that Biden only won because of fraud.\n\nBut as Trump charges toward his rematch with Biden in 2024, Portman has been replaced by Sen. J.D. Vance, a potential vice presidential pick who has echoed Trump's false claims of fraud and said he'll accept the results this fall only \"if it's a free and fair election.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, other possible VP picks, also declined to object to Biden's victory over Trump, but have been less committal this year. Rubio said recently if \"things are wrong\" with November's election, Republicans won't stand by and accept the outcome.\n\nImagine the nerve of some of these Republicans demanding \"free and fair elections.\" In the eyes of the AP, even if something clearly looks fishy, conservatives are expected to \"stand by and accept the outcome.\" After all, this is America, not some third-world banana republic where the ruling party tries to throw its political opponents in prison. (Oh, wait...)\n\nOne has to wonder where the AP's outrage was over Stacey Abrams and the countless times she claimed that the Georgia gubernatorial election was stolen from her. And how did they manage to completely fail to denounce Hillary Clinton? She went around for years claiming that the 2016 election was rigged against her and that Donald Trump was an \"illegitimate president.\" Even NBC News was forced to admit that about her. But if anyone dares to question all of the hanky panky that took place with mountains of mail-in ballots during the 2020 election, they are clearly stooges of Vladimir Putin or dangerous, delusional rebels.\n\nI've yet to see irrefutable evidence that there was enough election fraud in 2020 to reverse the results of the presidential election, though we also can't rule it out entirely. But there is no doubt whatsoever that plenty of fraud was taking place. To this day we have no idea if Republican Claudia Tenney actually won back her seat in Congress representing what was then New York's 22nd Congressional District and we will never know. Multiple people were charged with election fraud for casting votes for the dead or voting or attempting to vote twice in the same race. Thousands of ballots were unable to be verified and the race was eventually called for Tenney by a margin of 109 votes.\n\nIs any of that sort of fraud still taking place? Look no further than Bridgeport, Connecticut, and its mayoral races (plural). So it would be nice if the Associated Press could climb down from its high horse and stop lecturing us about \"election deniers\" and how terrible they are. There are very good reasons why Republicans are fighting to install election monitors in every precinct, particularly in the swing states. The only reason we know about many of the cases of fraudulent voting in NY-22 four years ago is because we had monitors in place checking all of the ballots against funeral notices and the early voting lists. If J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio want to raise concerns about ensuring that this year's elections are \"free and fair,\" that is their right. Beyond that, it's their obligation under the oaths they took to protect the Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, as the 2024 election approaches, Trump's influence has grown, leading to increased skepticism among GOP members about the election process.\n\nThe replacement of Portman by Senator JD Vance, a Trump ally who has echoed claims of election fraud, signifies a broader shift within the party. Prominent Republican figures such as Senators Tim Scott and Marco Rubio have shown less commitment to unequivocally accepting future election results, suggesting a conditional acceptance based on perceived fairness.\n\nThe rise of election deniers within Congress, now comprising nearly a third of its members, reflects a concerning trend. These individuals, who either supported efforts to overturn the 2020 results or have cast doubts on the election's integrity, are gaining influence. This trend is bolstered by Trump's strategic placements within the Republican National Committee and the broader party apparatus, emphasizing election integrity as a priority.\n\nThe States United Action report underscores the extent of this influence, identifying numerous election deniers running for Congress in 2024. This infiltration extends to key party positions and legislative efforts, indicating a deep-rooted skepticism that threatens to undermine public trust in the democratic process.\n\nThe analysis warns of the potential consequences of having significant numbers of lawmakers who question the legitimacy of elections. This could lead to a scenario where the results of future elections, including the pivotal 2024 presidential race, are contested more vigorously, possibly leading to political instability and further erosion of democratic norms. The emphasis on election integrity and the actions of figures like Speaker Mike Johnson, who has a history of challenging election outcomes, exemplify the party's increasing alignment with Trump's narrative, raising concerns about the future of American democracy.", "source": {"uri": "theindependent.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asir_f@theindependent.sg", "name": "Asir F", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/17203137/MORNING-DIGEST-2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9581357", "eventUri": "eng-9581357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

This past weekend in Minnesota, he falsely told his supporters that he won the state last time around. (Joe Biden won by 7 percentage points.)\n\nAnd Trump has even said he doesn't really want to hire anyone on his campaign who accepted that Biden won in 2020: \"I wouldn't feel good about it.\"\n\nYet a number of politicians considered top contenders for becoming Trump's running mate did just that, and now have to show their loyalty to the former president in other ways. Others, however, have long been vocal with their false claims of a rigged election.\n\nThree of those top contenders -- Sens. JD Vance of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina -- could, if chosen to be on Trump's ticket, find themselves in the position of certifying their own election outcome in the Senate in 2025, win or lose.\n\nAnd now, duking it out to show Trump that they stand by him, none of these potential vice presidential picks have committed to accepting the 2024 election results, whether Trump wins or loses.\n\nAs the vice-presidential headhunt barrels along, here is what some of the pool's leading choices have said not only about the 2020 election, but also about 2024.\n\nA fervent Trump supporter on Capitol Hill, Stefanik notably voted against certifying Pennsylvania's election results even after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities, unconstitutional overreach by unelected state officials and judges ignoring state election laws, and a fundamental lack of ballot integrity and security,\" Stefanik wrote in an op-ed on the morning of Jan. 6 explaining her intent to reject the electors.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence for irregularities or fraud -- claims that have been litigated dozens of times without success in court -- Stefanik has continued to sow doubts about the 2020 election results in public appearances and stood by her decision to reject Pennsylvania's elector slate.\n\n\"I would not have done what Mike Pence did. I don't think that was the right approach,\" Stefanik said in an interview on CNN in early 2024, referring to the then-vice president's role in certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nIn an appearance on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in January, Stefanik declined to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\n\"We will see if this is a legal and valid election,\" she told moderator Kristen Welker.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance has been a megaphone for Trump's stolen election claims, doubling down in public comments on his view that there were major inconsistencies and illegal balloting changes in 2020.\n\nVance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, has signaled that he would have declined to certify the election had he been in Pence's position.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Vance said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" in February.\n\nIf he were chosen to join Trump's ticket this fall, Vance, as a member of the Senate, may find himself in the position of choosing to certify -- or not -- his own win or loss on the presidential ticket.\n\nWhen asked by CNN this month about the vote in November, Vance said, \"Sure, if it's a free and fair election, I will accept the results standard, whoever wins.\"\n\nRelatively unknown on the national stage until he launched his own bid for president in 2023, Burgum has emerged in recent weeks as a top contender to serve in a future Trump administration -- even garnering several mentions from Trump himself when addressing the future of his ticket.\n\nAs the possibility of joining the ticket becomes a more serious reality for the Great Plains governor, Burgum has begun to indulge in Trump's election denialism despite past comments to the contrary.\n\n\"Mike Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6,\" Burgum said at the first Republican presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, with Pence standing only a few yards away from him.\n\nBurgum acknowledged that Trump ultimately lost the 2020 election, but in a nod to Trump, pins Biden's win on irregularities in the voting process.\n\n\"I believe that Joe Biden won the 2020 election but I also, based on the number of votes that were in but I think that because of Covid, there was a huge number of irregularities because we changed a bunch of rules in certain places, in certain precincts, in certain states,\" he said in an early May interview on CNN.\n\nBurgum, like other contenders, has declined to comment on whether he would accept the 2024 election results. Pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper on the possibility of political violence if Trump were to lose, Burgum declined to address that hypothetical scenario and said he was \"looking forward\" to seeing Vice President Kamala Harris certifying a Trump win next year.\n\nA spokesperson for Burgum did not respond to a request for comment on whether the governor would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nLike Scott, Rubio voted to certify the 2020 election results in the Senate when the body reconvened after protesters had stormed the Capitol. In a speech on the Senate floor that night, Rubio signaled to colleagues that a vote against certifying the results was a \"terrible idea\" at the time but that he respected his colleagues' decision to contest certain slates of electors.\n\n\"Democracy is held together by people's confidence in the election and a willingness to abide by its results,\" Rubio said, acknowledging that several of his colleagues were prepared to vote against certifying results from states like Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\n\"Now listen, it's important to understand something: Even the people objecting in the Senate recognize that it's not going to pass. It's not going to change the outcome, but it's going to send a message, and it's going to make a point. The problem is, I think it's a terrible idea at this moment,\" he continued.\n\nAs his Senate re-election campaign got underway the following year, Rubio was pressed more often on the attack on the Capitol and Trump and Pence's actions. Though he didn't go as far as to contradict Trump's assertions that Pence could have chosen to block the certification of Biden's win, Rubio agreed with the former vice president that he did not have the constitutional authority to overturn the election results.\n\n\"If a vice president has that power, Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden in four years or two years, and then Kamala Harris can decide not -- to overturn the election. I don't want to wind up there,\" Rubio said in an interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" in February 2022.\n\nBut as the vice-presidential search has heated up, Rubio declined to commit to accepting the 2024 election results in an interview this month on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" and instead asked why Democrats are not being pressed to answer that particular line of questioning.\n\nAs a member of the Senate in 2020, Scott voted to certify Biden's election win. During his own run for president, Scott avoided the topic of the 2020 election unless asked. Unlike other colleagues on the Hill, Scott stopped short of fully supporting Trump's stolen election claims but noted that he did see irregularities in the voting process.\n\n\"The President's legal team exercised its right to access the courts by initiating suits in state and federal courts in numerous states. Some of these lawsuits have even been presided over and adjudicated by conservative judges nominated by President Trump. Thus far, no justice, judge or fact finder has found evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned,\" Scott wrote in a statement the morning of the certification vote, explaining that he saw no \"constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors.\"\n\nOnstage at the first Republican presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, Scott said Pence \"absolutely\" did the right thing by certifying the election results.\n\nHowever, with the 2024 election now looming, Scott recently declined to say whether he would accept the election results in November.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" he told Welker's \"Meet the Press\" in May, dodging several follow-up questions on whether he would contest the election's outcome.\n\nLongtime Trump surrogate Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota rarely deviates in her support of the former president, including on the topic of the 2020 election. Despite her steadfast support, Noem has recently offered vague answers on Pence's actions on Jan. 6 and whether there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as Trump claims.\n\n\"You know, I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes. And the information that he had at that time, I don't know how he based his decisions,\" she said in an interview on CNN in April, adding that Pence is a \"nice man\" but has \"failed Donald Trump since that day because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.\"\n\nJust two days after the 2020 election, Noem wrote in a post on X that the election system was \"rigged\" against the former president.\n\nBut in the days after the vote to certify the election, Noem began to strike a similar chord to many of her Republican colleagues: Though there may have been inconsistencies in the vote from her perspective, she recognized Biden as the winner of the election.\n\n\"I said that President Trump after the election deserved his day in court. He went to court, did not get a different result. Therefore, we now have President Biden,\" she said at a news conference in South Dakota in early 2021.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a request for comment on whether Noem would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has largely been out of the public eye since the end of the Trump administration, but he has remained a loyal Trump supporter in the interim. Though he largely avoided the spotlight in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection at the Capitol, Carson told Fox News in March that he had spoken with Pence in the days leading up to the riot on Capitol Hill about his obligation to oversee the certification of the election.\n\n\"I believe he tried to do what was right,\" Carson said of Pence's actions on Jan. 6 without signaling how he would have acted in the same position, adding that \"the right thing would have been to try to focus us on having a process that is legitimate.\"\n\nCarson, however, did not make his opinion clear on how Pence should have proceeded on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Based on recent polling numbers and Democrat's past precedent of denying election results, you would be better served sending this question to the White House,\" his chief of staff, Andrew Hughes, said in a statement to NBC News when asked if Carson would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nCarson has not said publicly if he would accept this election's outcome, regardless of who wins.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And, win or lose, it is our job to notice what is happening and shout it from the rooftops.\n\nA memo must have gone out. Because in several prominent newspapers, the same propaganda appeared at nearly the same time.\n\nThe Washington Post said, \"Top Republicans, led by Trump, refuse to commit to accept 2024 election results.\" The New York Times similarly intoned, \"Leading Republicans have refused to say flatly that they will accept the outcome of the presidential election if Donald Trump loses.\" Rolling Stone chastised a former presidential candidate: \"Tim Scott Embraces Trump's Election Denialism, Won't Commit to Accept Results.\"\n\nWhile ordinarily, elections mean both sides accept the procedures in advance so that either side may have confidence in the results, actual confidence in those results depends upon what actually happens. If you have good rules, but there is extensive rule-breaking, why should anyone accept the results?\n\nThe recently minted requirement of pregame assent to an election outcome is a ridiculous demand akin to a religious test. Even in the best of times, no one can ever have certainty about an election outcome. Elections consist of hundreds of millions of votes and tens of thousands of rules and regulations, are conducted in 50 states and thousands of counties, and involve the actions of thousands of officials and volunteers to implement and interpret these rules.\n\nTrump's critics are asking him to have faith and pledge his support for the unknown result of an election that has not happened. In fact, the rules are in flux and will be so until nearly the last minute through court and legislative maneuvering, as was the experience of recent elections. Furthermore, every election has recount procedures and is subject to legal challenges.\n\nThe upcoming election is one where the machinations of prosecutors, local party officials, domestic intelligence agencies, and the current administration are all unknown, but we do know we live in an era of extreme partisanship and that the people running most of the institutions, regardless of party, are irrevocably hostile to Trump. Nonetheless, they demand that Trump ignore the fact that some of the most senior officials in New York, Georgia, and the federal government are hell bent on stopping him from being president.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Trump and his supporters' anticipatory skepticism of the 2024 election is warranted. A prudent person will wait to see what happens. Critics imply that Trump will only cry foul if he loses, and this is probably true, but it is okay to cry foul when the other side does not win fair and square.\n\nFor example, Republican skepticism of the 2020 election was warranted. Even if somehow Biden got the most votes, the means by which he did so was unorthodox and probably illegal. Things happened that we only previously witnessed in Third World countries: weeks of vote counting, millions of unverifiable mail-in ballots, rule changes later deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional, a refusal of the media or courts to look into irregularities, violence coordinated by the intelligence agencies to stop any inquiry permitted during the electoral vote count, and a sustained effort to pressure Trump to concede even as the matter remained in extreme doubt.\n\nThis should all be contrasted with the conduct of the 2016 election. Trump won. That election was more normal, with enough verifiable and morally certain wins to call the result on election night. The rules governing the election were the same ones that always applied. True, the result defied the polls and was unexpected -- particularly by Hillary Clinton, the media, and her other supporters -- but there was nothing procedurally unusual that happened on election day or thereafter to cast the result in doubt.\n\nThe post-election weirdness, however, began immediately in 2016. Hillary refused to concede and did not address her supporters until the next day. Then a story floated in the weeks before the election became a firestorm -- the supposed critical impact of \"Russian collusion.\"\n\nThis turned out to be complete nonsense, ginned up from a false dossier funded by the Clinton campaign and promoted by partisan intelligence agencies. But it was also the alibi for Hillary's loss -- a vague suggestion that machines were hijacked and Trump was an illegitimate president, regardless of the formal outcome of the election.\n\nRussian collusion became the Trojan Horse through which the intelligence agencies got Trump's preferred National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, removed and then indicted, as well as his first Attorney General and immigration hawk, Jeff Sessions, to resign.\n\nCorrupt FBI head James Comey used the same nonsense story to lie to and spy on Trump, and Comey's eventual termination led to the appointment of the half-senile Robert Mueller and his partisan accomplices to harass Trump as special counsel. The Mueller charade went on for two years, handicapping and distracting Trump during his first two years as president, even though the special counsel office's internal reports showed that the prosecution team knew the original Russian collusion allegations lacked all merit.\n\nWhat Biden and his supporters are looking for with all the \"accept the result\" talk is precommitment. This is something guys in sales do. You said you need to be below $100; if I get you a price below $100, you are telling me you will buy. But Biden and company are not saying anything persuasive to gain bipartisan assent to the election process. They just want the commitment, so if they pull off a win -- legitimately or otherwise -- they can use the pledges to shut up their critics.\n\nThe approach brings to mind the attempts to box Trump in during the 2016 Republican primary. All of the Republicans figured Trump would ultimately lose to an establishment choice but that he might cause chaos out of spite. So they demanded that he sign a pledge to support the eventual nominee. Everyone else did it -- Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, and Lindsey Graham -- and they used it as a cudgel against Trump. Trump hemmed and hawed, but he eventually signed the pledge too.\n\nThen Trump, rather improbably, won the Republican primary. And now the pledge had become an albatross for his enemies, who meant to confine him. At that point, Jeb, Graham, and others among these supposedly moral and honorable men, men allegedly offended by Trump's lack of morals and decorum, went back on their pledge and worked overtly and covertly to undermine Trump. What a bunch of rats!\n\nThere is no reason for Trump or anyone to support the results of the 2024 election and certainly not this far in advance. There are fewer reasons to trust the process or the people running the process than one could in the high-trust America of yesteryear. Some of the most respected institutions, like the FBI and the courts, have become unhinged and dangerous in their maniacal desire to stop Trump. Nothing about a diverse, highly partisan, and increasingly corrupt society like ours makes \"trust\" something that we should feel about the election, nor is skepticism something to be ashamed of. It's just common sense.\n\nThe items of societal consensus are shrinking every day. A fair election in 2024 that commands the assent of both sides seems unlikely. The Trump people, having been burned before, are primed to reject anything but a win, particularly in light of weeks of positive poll numbers. And the anti-Trump factions are so attached to holding onto power that they will change the rules in order to keep it and browbeat those who commit the crime of noticing.\n\nIt is our job to win. And, win or lose, it is our job to notice what is happening and shout it from the rooftops.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors":

This past weekend in Minnesota, he falsely told his supporters that he won the state last time around. (Biden won by 7 percentage points.)\n\nAnd Trump has even said he doesn't really want to hire anyone on his campaign who accepted that Biden won in 2020: \"I wouldn't feel good about it.\"\n\nYet a number of politicians considered top contenders for becoming Trump's running mate did just that, and now have to show their loyalty to the former president in other ways. Others, however, have long been vocal with their false claims of a rigged election.\n\nThree of those top contenders -- Sens. JD Vance of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina -- could, if chosen to be on Trump's ticket, find themselves in the position of certifying their own election outcome in the Senate in 2025, win or lose.\n\nAnd now, duking it out to show Trump that they stand by him, none of these potential vice presidential picks have committed to accepting the 2024 election results, whether Trump wins or loses.\n\nAs the vice-presidential headhunt barrels along, here is what some of the pool's leading choices have said not only about the 2020 election, but also about 2024.\n\nA fervent Trump supporter on Capitol Hill, Stefanik notably voted against certifying Pennsylvania's election results even after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"Tens of millions of Americans are rightly concerned that the 2020 election featured unprecedented voting irregularities, unconstitutional overreach by unelected state officials and judges ignoring state election laws, and a fundamental lack of ballot integrity and security,\" Stefanik wrote in an op-ed on the morning of Jan. 6 explaining her intent to reject the electors.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence for irregularities or fraud -- claims that have been litigated dozens of times without success in court -- Stefanik has continued to sow doubts about the 2020 election results in public appearances and stood by her decision to reject Pennsylvania's elector slate.\n\n\"I would not have done what Mike Pence did. I don't think that was the right approach,\" Stefanik said in an interview on CNN in early 2024, referring to the then-vice president's role in certifying the 2020 election results.\n\nIn an appearance on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in January, Stefanik declined to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\n\"We will see if this is a legal and valid election,\" she told moderator Kristen Welker.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance has been a megaphone for Trump's stolen election claims, doubling down in public comments on his view that there were major inconsistencies and illegal balloting changes in 2020.\n\nVance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, has signaled that he would have declined to certify the election had he been in Pence's position.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Vance said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" in February.\n\nIf he were chosen to join Trump's ticket this fall, Vance, as a member of the Senate, may find himself in the position of choosing to certify -- or not -- his own win or loss on the presidential ticket.\n\nWhen asked by CNN this month about the vote in November, Vance said, \"Sure, if it's a free and fair election, I will accept the results standard, whoever wins.\"\n\nRelatively unknown on the national stage until he launched his own bid for president in 2023, Burgum has emerged in recent weeks as a top contender to serve in a future Trump administration -- even garnering several mentions from Trump himself when addressing the future of his ticket.\n\nAs the possibility of joining the ticket becomes a more serious reality for the Great Plains governor, Burgum has begun to indulge in Trump's election denialism despite past comments to the contrary.\n\n\"Mike Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6,\" Burgum said at the first Republican presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, with Pence standing only a few yards away from him.\n\nBurgum acknowledged that Trump ultimately lost the 2020 election, but in a nod to Trump, pins Biden's win on irregularities in the voting process.\n\n\"I believe that Joe Biden won the 2020 election but I also, based on the number of votes that were in but I think that because of Covid, there was a huge number of irregularities because we changed a bunch of rules in certain places, in certain precincts, in certain states,\" he said in an early May interview on CNN.\n\nBurgum, like other contenders, has declined to comment on whether he would accept the 2024 election results. Pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper on the possibility of political violence if Trump were to lose, Burgum declined to address that hypothetical scenario and said he was \"looking forward\" to seeing Vice President Kamala Harris certifying a Trump win next year.\n\nA spokesperson for Burgum did not respond to a request for comment on whether the governor would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nLike Scott, Rubio voted to certify the 2020 election results in the Senate when the body reconvened after protesters had stormed the Capitol. In a speech on the Senate floor that night, Rubio signaled to colleagues that a vote against certifying the results was a \"terrible idea\" at the time but that he respected his colleagues' decision to contest certain slates of electors.\n\n\"Democracy is held together by people's confidence in the election and a willingness to abide by its results,\" Rubio said, acknowledging that several of his colleagues were prepared to vote against certifying results from states like Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\n\"Now listen, it's important to understand something: Even the people objecting in the Senate recognize that it's not going to pass. It's not going to change the outcome, but it's going to send a message, and it's going to make a point. The problem is, I think it's a terrible idea at this moment,\" he continued.\n\nAs his Senate re-election campaign got underway the following year, Rubio was pressed more often on the attack on the Capitol and Trump and Pence's actions. Though he didn't go as far as to contradict Trump's assertions that Pence could have chosen to block the certification of Biden's win, Rubio agreed with the former vice president that he did not have the constitutional authority to overturn the election results.\n\n\"If a vice president has that power, Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden in four years or two years, and then Kamala Harris can decide not -- to overturn the election. I don't want to wind up there,\" Rubio said in an interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" in February 2022.\n\nBut as the vice-presidential search has heated up, Rubio declined to commit to accepting the 2024 election results in an interview this month on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" and instead asked why Democrats are not being pressed to answer that particular line of questioning.\n\nAs a member of the Senate in 2020, Scott voted to certify Biden's election win. During his own run for president, Scott avoided the topic of the 2020 election unless asked. Unlike other colleagues on the Hill, Scott stopped short of fully supporting Trump's stolen election claims but noted that he did see irregularities in the voting process.\n\n\"The President's legal team exercised its right to access the courts by initiating suits in state and federal courts in numerous states. Some of these lawsuits have even been presided over and adjudicated by conservative judges nominated by President Trump. Thus far, no justice, judge or fact finder has found evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned,\" Scott wrote in a statement the morning of the certification vote, explaining that he saw no \"constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors.\"\n\nOnstage at the first Republican presidential primary debate in Milwaukee, Scott said Pence \"absolutely\" did the right thing by certifying the election results.\n\nHowever, with the 2024 election now looming, Scott recently declined to say whether he would accept the election results in November.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" he told Welker's \"Meet the Press\" in May, dodging several follow-up questions on whether he would contest the election's outcome.\n\nLongtime Trump surrogate Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota rarely deviates in her support of the former president, including on the topic of the 2020 election. Despite her steadfast support, Noem has recently offered vague answers on Pence's actions on Jan. 6 and whether there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as Trump claims.\n\n\"You know, I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes. And the information that he had at that time, I don't know how he based his decisions,\" she said in an interview on CNN in April, adding that Pence is a \"nice man\" but has \"failed Donald Trump since that day because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.\"\n\nJust two days after the 2020 election, Noem wrote in a post on X that the election system was \"rigged\" against the former president.\n\nBut in the days after the vote to certify the election, Noem began to strike a similar chord to many of her Republican colleagues: Though there may have been inconsistencies in the vote from her perspective, she recognized Biden as the winner of the election.\n\n\"I said that President Trump after the election deserved his day in court. He went to court, did not get a different result. Therefore, we now have President Biden,\" she said at a news conference in South Dakota in early 2021.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a request for comment on whether Noem would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has largely been out of the public eye since the end of the Trump administration, but he has remained a loyal Trump supporter in the interim. Though he largely avoided the spotlight in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection at the Capitol, Carson told Fox News in March that he had spoken with Pence in the days leading up to the riot on Capitol Hill about his obligation to oversee the certification of the election.\n\n\"I believe he tried to do what was right,\" Carson said of Pence's actions on Jan. 6 without signaling how he would have acted in the same position, adding that \"the right thing would have been to try to focus us on having a process that is legitimate.\"\n\nCarson, however, did not make his opinion clear on how Pence should have proceeded on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Based on recent polling numbers and Democrat's past precedent of denying election results, you would be better served sending this question to the White House,\" his chief of staff, Andrew Hughes, said in a statement to NBC News when asked if Carson would commit to accepting the 2024 election results.\n\nCarson has not said publicly if he would accept this election's outcome, regardless of who wins.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Because in several prominent newspapers, the same propaganda appeared at nearly the same time.\n\nThe Washington Post said, \"Top Republicans, led by Trump, refuse to commit to accept 2024 election results.\" The New York Times similarly intoned, \"Leading Republicans have refused to say flatly that they will accept the outcome of the presidential election if Donald Trump loses.\" Rolling Stone chastised a former presidential candidate: \"Tim Scott Embraces Trump's Election Denialism, Won't Commit to Accept Results.\"\n\nWhile ordinarily, elections mean both sides accept the procedures in advance so that either side may have confidence in the results, actual confidence in those results depends upon what actually happens. If you have good rules, but there is extensive rule-breaking, why should anyone accept the results?\n\nThe recently minted requirement of pregame assent to an election outcome is a ridiculous demand akin to a religious test. Even in the best of times, no one can ever have certainty about an election outcome. Elections consist of hundreds of millions of votes and tens of thousands of rules and regulations, are conducted in 50 states and thousands of counties, and involve the actions of thousands of officials and volunteers to implement and interpret these rules.\n\nTrump's critics are asking him to have faith and pledge his support for the unknown result of an election that has not happened. In fact, the rules are in flux and will be so until nearly the last minute through court and legislative maneuvering, as was the experience of recent elections. Furthermore, every election has recount procedures and is subject to legal challenges.\n\nThe upcoming election is one where the machinations of prosecutors, local party officials, domestic intelligence agencies, and the current administration are all unknown, but we do know we live in an era of extreme partisanship and that the people running most of the institutions, regardless of party, are irrevocably hostile to Trump. Nonetheless, they demand that Trump ignore the fact that some of the most senior officials in New York, Georgia, and the federal government are hell bent on stopping him from being president.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Trump and his supporters' anticipatory skepticism of the 2024 election is warranted. A prudent person will wait to see what happens. Critics imply that Trump will only cry foul if he loses, and this is probably true, but it is okay to cry foul when the other side does not win fair and square.\n\nFor example, Republican skepticism of the 2020 election was warranted. Even if somehow Biden got the most votes, the means by which he did so was unorthodox and probably illegal. Things happened that we only previously witnessed in Third World countries: weeks of vote counting, millions of unverifiable mail-in ballots, rule changes later deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional, a refusal of the media or courts to look into irregularities, violence coordinated by the intelligence agencies to stop any inquiry permitted during the electoral vote count, and a sustained effort to pressure Trump to concede even as the matter remained in extreme doubt.\n\nThis should all be contrasted with the conduct of the 2016 election. Trump won. That election was more normal, with enough verifiable and morally certain wins to call the result on election night. The rules governing the election were the same ones that always applied. True, the result defied the polls and was unexpected -- particularly by Hillary Clinton, the media, and her other supporters -- but there was nothing procedurally unusual that happened on election day or thereafter to cast the result in doubt.\n\nThe post-election weirdness, however, began immediately in 2016. Hillary refused to concede and did not address her supporters until the next day. Then a story floated in the weeks before the election became a firestorm -- the supposed critical impact of \"Russian collusion.\"\n\nThis turned out to be complete nonsense, ginned up from a false dossier funded by the Clinton campaign and promoted by partisan intelligence agencies. But it was also the alibi for Hillary's loss -- a vague suggestion that machines were hijacked and Trump was an illegitimate president, regardless of the formal outcome of the election.\n\nRussian collusion became the Trojan Horse through which the intelligence agencies got Trump's preferred National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, removed and then indicted, as well as his first Attorney General and immigration hawk, Jeff Sessions, to resign.\n\nCorrupt FBI head James Comey used the same nonsense story to lie to and spy on Trump, and Comey's eventual termination led to the appointment of the half-senile Robert Mueller and his partisan accomplices to harass Trump as special counsel. The Mueller charade went on for two years, handicapping and distracting Trump during his first two years as president, even though the special counsel office's internal reports showed that the prosecution team knew the original Russian collusion allegations lacked all merit.\n\nWhat Biden and his supporters are looking for with all the \"accept the result\" talk is precommitment. This is something guys in sales do. You said you need to be below $100; if I get you a price below $100, you are telling me you will buy. But Biden and company are not saying anything persuasive to gain bipartisan assent to the election process. They just want the commitment, so if they pull off a win -- legitimately or otherwise -- they can use the pledges to shut up their critics.\n\nThe approach brings to mind the attempts to box Trump in during the 2016 Republican primary. All of the Republicans figured Trump would ultimately lose to an establishment choice but that he might cause chaos out of spite. So they demanded that he sign a pledge to support the eventual nominee. Everyone else did it -- Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, and Lindsey Graham -- and they used it as a cudgel against Trump. Trump hemmed and hawed, but he eventually signed the pledge too.\n\nThen Trump, rather improbably, won the Republican primary. And now the pledge had become an albatross for his enemies, who meant to confine him. At that point, Jeb, Graham, and others among these supposedly moral and honorable men, men allegedly offended by Trump's lack of morals and decorum, went back on their pledge and worked overtly and covertly to undermine Trump. What a bunch of rats!\n\nThere is no reason for Trump or anyone to support the results of the 2024 election and certainly not this far in advance. There are fewer reasons to trust the process or the people running the process than one could in the high-trust America of yesteryear. Some of the most respected institutions, like the FBI and the courts, have become unhinged and dangerous in their maniacal desire to stop Trump. Nothing about a diverse, highly partisan, and increasingly corrupt society like ours makes \"trust\" something that we should feel about the election, nor is skepticism something to be ashamed of. It's just common sense.\n\nThe items of societal consensus are shrinking every day. A fair election in 2024 that commands the assent of both sides seems unlikely. The Trump people, having been burned before, are primed to reject anything but a win, particularly in light of weeks of positive poll numbers. And the anti-Trump factions are so attached to holding onto power that they will change the rules in order to keep it and browbeat those who commit the crime of noticing.\n\nIt is our job to win. And, win or lose, it is our job to notice what is happening and shout it from the rooftops.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"},

I like that a lot.\" -- eds.]\n\nDonald Trump's vice presidential litmus test is pretty simple: Are you committed to rejecting the 2024 results if Trump loses the election?\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida became the latest Republican to betray the nation, not to mention their oath of office, for a chance at being selected as Trump's running mate. Rubio joins Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem in publicly prostrating themselves to Trump for the lure of power.\n\nBut the GOP parade of prebuttal for an election that hasn't even happened yet is just one way Trump is preparing his supporters, his campaign, and the entire Republican apparatus for a potential loss in November.\n\nHere are several other ways that he's laying the groundwork for a fierce response to any outcome he doesn't like in November.\n\nTrump allies, such as former White House aide Steve Bannon, are constantly reinforcing the idea that the only way President Joe Biden can win reelection is by cheating. Media Matters for America's Matt Gertz recently published a piece on the rhetorical effort that showed Bannon in late March pounding his \"War Room\" listeners with the notion that Biden can't possibly win fairly in November.\n\n\"The only way they defeat Trump is to steal it,\" Bannon said. \"The only way they defeat Trump is they steal it. He is unstoppable.\"\n\nHouse Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are pushing new legislation that would supposedly prohibit something that is already outlawed nearly everywhere: non-U.S. citizen voting.\n\nAt a recent press conference, Johnson charged that undocumented immigrants are voting in U.S. elections before immediately admitting that he has no evidence to back it up.\n\n\"We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections,\" Johnson claimed. \"But it's not been something that's easily provable. We don't have that number.\"\n\nNever mind the evidence, Republicans are planting a seed that some virulently racist and anti-immigrant Americans are already prone to believing: that their vote is being nullified by someone who isn't a citizen.\n\nThe Trump campaign itself has become a bare-bones operation with a nearly nonexistent presence in the swing states. Part of that low profile is surely due to the cash-strapped state of Trump's campaign, but it also appears to be by design.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump himself is downplaying Get Out The Vote efforts: \"[Trump] has told people in charge of the RNC to focus on election security more than field programs, because he believes he will be able to personally motivate his voters to the polls in the fall, these people said. ... He told them to 'focus on the cheating.'\"\n\nThe RNC is planning a \"massive\" so-called election integrity program that will include enlisting tens of thousands of volunteers to monitor precincts and election workers across the country.\n\nEven as some Republican officials attempt to recommit the party to early voting, Trump is having trouble staying on script. At rallies and in interviews, Trump still encourages distrust about mail-in voting among the MAGA faithful, blaming it for his 2020 loss.\n\nAt a recent rally in Wisconsin, Trump praised the Republican chair of Delaware for getting \"rid of the mail-in voting.\"\n\nThe Washington Post also reported that Trump and his new RNC leadership had all but shuttered the \"Bank Your Vote\" program that had been launched earlier this year by ejected RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\nBut Trump's handlers are attempting to push early voting by having him plug it in videos and social media posts on Truth Social.\n\n\"It turned out to be not such a bad idea,\" Trump said of mail-in voting Sunday in a video message to California Republican delegates. \"We may not like the current system but we need to master the rules and beat the Democrats at their own game. Then we can make our own rules.\"\n\nStill, the end result for his base is a simmering distrust of the way some 30 to 40% of voters -- mostly Democrats -- cast their ballots.\n\nAny analyst looking at the overall structural advantages of the Biden campaign would tell you that it likely has the edge in the final months of a close, competitive election. It's already vastly out fundraising Trump and outspending him on advertising and field operations -- the traditional nuts and bolts of campaigning.\n\nBut Trump doesn't seem nearly as concerned with resourcing the front end of his campaign because he likely believes he has less control over the election's outcome than he does over how his supporters respond to those results.\n\nInstead, Trump is pouring time and energy into cultivating an insurance policy for losing -- a way to agitate and animate his most loyal followers in the event things don't go his way.\n\nIn Trump's view, if he wins, great. But if he loses, he is laying the groundwork for months of mayhem, protests, and election denialism that could easily surpass the scope of the violent 2021 insurrection he incited the last time he lost a presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "crooksandliars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crooks and Liars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kerry_eleveld@crooksandliars.com", "name": "Kerry

Yes, absolutely,\" Djokovic said in an on-court interview. \"So I'm hoping that as the tournament progresses each day or each match I'll be feeling a bit better.\"\n\nFearnley, a wild-card entry who recently finished playing college tennis at TCU, had a strong cheering section that erupted when he took the third set.\n\n\"He served very well, it was very difficult to break his serve. He made me work, definitely,\" Djokovic said.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion said he should have closed it out in straight sets, but that he \"was not really comfortable in my own skin, particularly in the third and fourth.\n\n\"Sometimes you have rough days where maybe you are not feeling your best,\" he added, \"and of course it also depends on the opponent across the net. He made me earn this victory.\"\n\nNo. 5 Jessica Pegula become the highest-seeded women's player to lose. The American was defeated by Wang Xinyu 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-1. For Wang, it was her first victory over a top-10 player.\n\nTwo-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka was the No. 3 seed at Wimbledon before she pulled out before the first round because of a shoulder injury.\n\nBritain's big day got off to a rough start when wild-card entry Yuriko Lily Miyazaki won only 19 points en route to a 6-0, 6-0 loss to Daria Kasatkina.\n\nThe 28-year-old Miyazaki committed 31 unforced errors and five double-faults in falling to the No. 14-seeded Kasatkina, a Russian who won the Eastbourne title ahead of the grass-court Grand Slam.\n\nLater on Centre Court, Andy Murray was set to play doubles with his brother, Jamie. The two-time Wimbledon champion pulled out of the singles competition.\n\nKasatkina will next face Paula Badosa, who advanced Thursday by beating Brenda Fruhvirtova 6-4, 6-2.\n\nNo. 12 Madison Keys marked U.S. Independence Day with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Wang Yafan to reach the third round.\n\n\"I've always really loved playing during the Fourth of July. I think I've spent more Fourths of Julys in London than anywhere else in the world,\" the 29-year-old American said. \"It's always fun, and it's definitely an experience. Like today walking by I saw a bunch of Americans, and they all said, 'Happy Fourth.'\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The British No.4 always knew she faced a tough test against the No.14 seed, yet still would have hoped for a better performance.\n\nThe world No.148 lost 6-0 6-0 on Court 18, lasting just 50 minutes and winning just 19 points in total against her Russian opponent. Kasatkina who won the Eastbourne title last week and looked in supreme form, showing no mercy against the home hopeful.\n\nShe will play Spaniard Paola Badosa in the third round after breezing through by winning 53 points and making just seven unforced errors to Miyazaki's 31. Miyazaki also produced five double-faults on a day she will want to forget.\n\nYet despite slipping to a heavy defeat, there is one huge silver lining for the 28-year-old: a \u00a393,000 payday. Prize money has risen at Wimbledon for 2024, meaning those who were knocked out in the first round still bagged \u00a360,000. For winning her match against Korpatsch, Miyazaki upped her winnings by \u00a333,000.\n\nShe will undoubtedly be upset not to have progressed to the third round in SW19, where the prize money ups again to \u00a3143,000, but it is still an impressive achievement for the Japan-born star. Her winning at Wimbledon will add to the $578,291 (\u00a3453,403) she has earned across her career.\n\nSpeaking about Kasatkina after her first-round win, Miyazaki said: \"I've never played her before, but I've definitely watched her play in the past. Yeah, I think, I mean, she won Eastbourne last week, so she's on good form. It will be good to see where my game's at.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, if the opportunity is there for a big court, to play on a big court, it would be amazing. But, I mean, any court here is so special.\"\n\nMiyazaki was the first British player to be knocked out on day four of Wimbledon, but there are many more Brits yet to play on Thursday. British No.1 Katie Boulter faces Harriet Dart on Court 1, while Jacob Fearnley has the monumental task of playing Novak Djokovic first on Centre Court.\n\nLater on, attention will turn to Andy Murray, who plays alongside his brother Jamie against the Australian pairing of John Peers and Rinky Hijikata. The Murray brothers are last on Centre Court and become the first opening-round doubles match to be given the honour of playing on the showcourt since 1995.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_keith@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Felix Keith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria_Kasatkina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daria Kasatkina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_Korpatsch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamara Korpatsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eastbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinky_Hijikata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rinky Hijikata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Dart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harriet Dart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Boulter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Boulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Peers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/article33168822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2160126253.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706362", "eventUri": "eng-9706362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Yes, absolutely,\" Djokovic said in an on-court interview. \"So I'm hoping that as the tournament progresses each day or each match I'll be feeling a bit better.\"\n\nFearnley, a wild-card entry who recently finished playing college tennis at TCU, had a strong cheering section that erupted when he took the third set.\n\n\"He served very well, it was very difficult to break his serve. He made me work, definitely,\" said Djokovic, who will face Alexei Popyrin in the third round.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion said he should have closed it out in straight sets but that he \"was not really comfortable in my own skin, particularly in the third and fourth.\n\n\"Sometimes you have rough days where maybe you are not feeling your best,\" he added, \"and of course it also depends on the opponent across the net.

Dart trailed 6-2 in the deciding tiebreaker. Boulter compiled 75 unforced errors and 39 winners.\n\nLater on Centre Court, Andy Murray was set to play doubles with his brother, Jamie.

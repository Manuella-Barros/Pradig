The alleged scam involves plots given to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's wife.\n\nIn a video clip, the protesting MLAs are seen carrying pillows and blankets. The Opposition was not allowed to discuss the issue in both the Houses today. The legislature session is slated to end on Friday. Assembly Speaker UT Khader rejected the opposition's adjournment motion notice on the matter which prompted the Opposition legislators to stage a day-and-night protest.\n\nWhile the ruling Congress urged the Speaker not to allow discussion on the issue citing rules, the opposition BJP claimed that a needle of suspicion is pointing to the family of the \"most important person\" of the state, and demanded that it be allowed.\n\nThe opposition also alleged a political motive behind formation of the inquiry commission to probe the matter and said it was aimed at denying the House an opportunity to debate the issue.\n\n\"After hearing both sides, as the adjournment notice that the opposition has given is not an urgent matter and as an inquiry commission has been constituted under a retired judge to probe the charges, also as the matter is also not of immediate occurrence, it has been rejected,\" the Speaker ruled.\n\nIt is alleged that compensatory sites were allotted to Siddaramaiah's wife Parvathi in an upmarket area in Mysuru, which had higher property value as compared to the location of her land which had been \"acquired\" by the MUDA. MUDA had allotted plots to Parvathi under a 50:50 ratio scheme in lieu of 3.16 acres of her land, where MUDA developed a residential layout. The controversial scheme envisages allotting 50 per cent of developed land to the land loser in lieu of undeveloped land acquired for forming layouts.\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition R Ashoka stood to press for adjournment motion on the issue, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister H K Patil, citing rules under \"Procedures and Conduct of Business in Karnataka Legislative Assembly\", said the issues that are before any tribunals or commissions or authority or courts for adjudication generally cannot be allowed in the form of an adjournment motion.\n\nHe also noted that as per the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 a single member inquiry commission was constituted by the government under former High Court Judge Justice P N Desai to probe the charges on July 14, 2024.\n\nLater speaking to reporters, Ashoka said: \"Congress has 136 MLAs. When we brought an adjournment motion regarding Rs 4,000 crore loot in MUDA scam, the government was scared and was running away (from discussion). They have passed key bills including the finance bill without discussion.\n\nThis government is (of) cowards, they don't have the courage to respond to MUDA allegations in the House. \" If the government had any \"shame or self esteem,\" it should have said on the floor of the House that the CM had taken 14 sites in a legal manner, and so did his supporters.\n\n\"It is a Rs 4,000 crore scam. More than one lakh square feet of land that belonged to Dalits has been looted...we wanted to raise this issue, we were not allowed...the Speaker's conduct in favour of the ruling party is condemnable...Condemning this conduct of the ruling party and the Speaker of suppressing the opposition voice, we are declaring day and night protest. All our MLAs and MLCs will protest day and night against this government,\" he added.\n\nState BJP President and MLA B Y Vijayendra too said both in the Assembly and Council \"we will hold overnight protest to ensure that injustice is not meted out to Dalits, sites given to Chief Minister's family are taken back and also over 5,000 sites that were illegally allocated.\"\n\nHe accused the Chief Minister of running away from discussion on the MUDA scam by not giving an opportunity to discuss it. \"If he had courage he should have told the Speaker to allow for discussion. The Speaker has been misused for not allowing the discussion and the opposition is being suppressed.\"\n\nThe Leader of Opposition BJP told reporters that the Congress government had offered them food

The legislature session is slated to end on Friday.\n\nAssembly Speaker U T Khader rejected the opposition's adjournment motion notice on the matter.\n\nWhile the ruling Congress, citing rules, urged the Speaker not to allow discussion on the issue, the opposition BJP, claiming that a needle of suspicion is pointing to the family of the \"most important person\" of the state, demanded that it be allowed.\n\nThe opposition also alleged a political motive behind formation of the inquiry commission to probe the matter and said it was aimed at denying the House an opportunity to debate the issue.\n\n\"After hearing both sides, as the adjournment notice that the opposition has given is not an urgent matter and as an inquiry commission has been constituted under a retired judge to probe the charges, also as the matter is also not of immediate occurrence, it has been rejected,\" the Speaker ruled.\n\nAs the Leader of Opposition R Ashoka stood to press for adjournment motion on the issue, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister H K Patil, citing rules under \"Procedures and Conduct of Business in Karnataka Legislative Assembly\", said the issues that are before any tribunals or commissions or authority or courts for adjudication generally cannot be allowed in the form of an adjournment motion.\n\nHe also noted that as per the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 a single member inquiry commission was constituted by the government under former High Court Judge Justice P N Desai to probe the charges on July 14, 2024.\n\nLater speaking to reporters, Ashoka said: \"Congress has 136 MLAs. When we brought an adjournment motion regarding Rs 4,000 crore loot in MUDA scam, the government was scared and was running away (from discussion). They have passed key bills including the finance bill without discussion. This government is (of) cowards, they don't have the courage to respond to MUDA allegations in the House.\" If the government had any \"shame or self esteem,\" it should have said on the floor of the House that the CM had taken 14 sites in a legal manner, and so did his supporters.\n\n\"It is a Rs 4,000 crore scam. More than one lakh square feet of land that belonged to Dalits has been looted.....we wanted to raise this issue, we were not allowed...the Speaker's conduct in favour of the ruling party is condemnable....Condemning this conduct of the ruling party and the Speaker of suppressing the opposition voice, we are declaring day and night protest. All our MLAs and MLCs will protest day and night against this government,\" he added.\n\nState BJP President and MLA B Y Vijayendra too said both in the Assembly and Council \"we will hold overnight protest to ensure that injustice is not meted out to Dalits, sites given to Chief Minister's family are taken back and also over 5,000 sites that were illegally allocated.\" He accused the Chief Minister of running away from discussion on the MUDA scam by not giving an opportunity to discuss it. \"If he had courage he should have told the Speaker to allow for discussion. The Speaker has been misused for not allowing the discussion and the opposition is being suppressed.\" It is alleged that compensatory sites were allotted to Siddaramaiah's wife Parvathi in an upmarket area in Mysuru, which had higher property value as compared to the location of her land which had been \"acquired\" by the MUDA.\n\nMUDA had allotted plots to Parvathi under a 50:50 ratio scheme in lieu of 3.16 acres of her land, where MUDA developed a residential layout.\n\nThe controversial scheme envisages allotting 50 per cent of developed land to the land loser in lieu of undeveloped land acquired for forming layouts.\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the din in the Assembly with the opposition insisting on a discussion over the MUDA scam, four bills -- The finance bill proposing supplementary budget of Rs 8,573.72 crore tabled by the Chief Minister, GST (Amendment) Bill, Irrigation (Amendment) Bill, and Municipality and Other Laws Bill -- were passed.\n\nThe amendment bills pertained to Medical Registration and Other Law, SC/ST/OBC Reservation of Appointment, Parks Preservation, land revenue and, ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites and remains, among others, were also tabled in the Assembly.

They are demanding a discussion on the alleged Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam in the assembly.\n\nAssembly Speaker U T Khader rejected the opposition's adjournment motion notice regarding the MUDA scam, leading opposition legislators to stage a day-and-night protest inside the assembly. Several members of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council including BJP and JDS parties including Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Chalavadi Narayanaswamy and CT Ravi participated in the protest.\n\nIn a video, the protesting MLAs were seen sleeping inside the Karnataka Assembly. They also sang devotional songs during a night-long dharna against the Congress government's alleged corruption at Vidhansoudha in Bengaluru.\n\nThe BJP unit of Karnataka has been demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, alleging that he is the \"father of the Muda scam.\"\n\nState party president Vijayendra condemned the Mysore Muda scam and demanded the resignation of CM Siddaramaiah. \"We demand the resignation of the corrupt Chief Minister, condemn the Mysore Muda scam in which Siddaramaiah is involved, and demand the resignation of the chief minister. An hour-long sit-in satyagraha has been started in the Vidhan Soudha with BJP and JDS members of both houses against the zero-development Congress government, including the multi-crore corruption of the Valmiki Development Corporation,\" he posted on X.\n\n\"After robbing 187 crores of Maharshi Valmiki Nigam, which was meant for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, MLA B Nagendra, who has already been caught by the ED, is standing in the queue and knocking on the door of the jail,\" the BJP leader added.\n\nOn the overnight protest inside the Karnataka Vidhan Soudha, BJP MLA Mahesh Tenginakai said that the protest will continue till the government is ready for discussion and debate. \"These (state government) people are not even ready for discussion, so 100 per cent they have committed a scam. If they are not ready for discussion and debate, our protest will continue... forget resignation, these people are not even ready for discussion. We have never seen such a bad government till date,\" he said.\n\nKarnataka BJP MLA Basanagouda R Patil said that this MUDA scam is of Rs 4000 crore and there is a lot of corruption in land acquisition and allotment of plots. \"We want that all the scams that happened during Siddaramaiah, BS Yediyurappa, and Basavaraj Bommai governments should be exposed. This adjustment politics that has been going on in Karnataka for the last 10-15 years should come to an end. Our party high command should understand that this adjustment politics has caused a lot of damage to the BJP in Karnataka,\" he said.\n\nHe further said that their demand is that Siddaramaiah should resign and the investigation of this MUDA scam should be given to the CBI.\n\nSiddaramaiah's wife, Parvathi, owned 3 acres of land in Kesare village of Mysuru. This land was acquired by MUDA for development, and compensatory sites were allotted to Siddaramaiah's wife in an upmarket area in Mysuru.

The \"other curious point\" is the date of appointment of the inquiry commission -- just a day before the commencement of the Legislature Session.\n\n\"The inquiry commission was constituted to stop the discussion on the issue in the House; it is a Caveat, it is like a anticipatory bail. Aware that the issue will be raised, the government has constituted the commission on July 14, a day ahead of the Assembly session. It is the responsibility of the House to discuss this vital issue, which has become talk of the state and the country. Discussion on the issue should be allowed,\" he said.\n\nPatil questioned whether the matter was \"really urgent\" to be raised as the adjournment motion.\n\nDeputy leader of opposition Arvind Bellad alleged that the Chief Minister and his family were given 14 sites. \"The custodian of the House (CM) has indulged in loot.\" This angered ruling Congress MLAs, who alleged that loot happened during the previous BJP regime, leading to heated exchange of words between ruling and opposition benches.\n\nCiting 'Kaul and Shakdher', considered to be a guide on rules and produces, Patil said the matter is urgent only if it is of very recent occurrence and it must be raised at the first available opportunity. \"They (opposition) had eight days' time, they did not raise it, they are waiting for political strategies, it means it is not urgent, they are using it for political convenience.\" Noting that the matter which has been continuing for some time cannot be raised through an adjournment motion, he further said: \"the adjournment notice contains many issues. Adjournment motion can be raised on a specific issue.\" Suresh Kumar alleged that the Law Minister was trying to take shelter under some rules. \"Unfortunately he is defending a very bad case....The needle of suspicion is pointed towards the family of the most important person of the state. When such is the situation it is the responsibility of the House to discuss, let the government reply and defend it. But not allowing discussion is not right.\" He also questioned how the discussion on ED was allowed yesterday, when the matter was in the court and ED was probing a case.\n\nAshoka said the scam is allegedly pegged at Rs 3,000 crore, and asked: \"should it not be discussed?\" After hearing arguments from both sides, the Speaker rejected the adjournment notice and adjourned the House for lunch, amid uproar from opposition members.

They urged Assembly Speaker U T Khader to defer the question hour and take up the discussion on priority.\n\nOnce the question hour ended, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister H K Patil said that a judicial inquiry under a retired judge had been ordered. The probe is looking into all issues and thus, a discussion cannot be taken up.\n\nHowever, senior BJP MLA Suresh Kumar said that the date of appointment of commission - July 14 - was \"curious\", as it was done a day before the Monsoon session of the Assembly kicked off.\n\n\"You did this to prevent this House from discussing this. This is like an anticipatory bail to prevent discussion in the Assembly,\" Kumar said. Patil then dug into the law books to contend that the motion was not feasible as \"a matter is adjourned only if it is of very recent occurrence and must be raised at the first available opportunity...You (Speaker) had given them (Opposition parties) eight days. They did not raise it on the first day nor the second,\" he said.\n\nKumar said that the discussion on the scam was essential as the \"needle of suspicion was pointing towards the family of a very important leader\".\n\nSubsequently, Khader rejected the motion and adjourned the Assembly for lunch. When the House reconvened, BJP leaders petitioned the Speaker to review his decision. When he refused, BJP members raised slogans against the Congress government and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, as the bemused CM sat on.\n\nAs the treasury benches started introducing Bills, BJP legislators stepped into the well and started protesting. The Assembly was adjourned again and the protests continued.\n\nThe overnight protest\n\nAmid talks that the BJP would stage an overnight protest over the MUDA scam, Ashok announced the same during the second half of the day's session. Speaking to reporters after the Assembly was adjourned for the day, the BJP leader claimed that the three-acre six gunta land which was gifted to Parvati by his brother, was originally owned by a Dalit. \"They did bogus conversion, change of land use and bogus denotification,\" he alleged.\n\nWhile the Assembly had discussed several scams which were under investigation in the past, this was not allowed, Ashok said, accusing the Speaker of bias towards the ruling party. \"We will continue our fight against the scam,\" he said.\n\nIn the scam, Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) had acquired 3 acre 16 gunta land owned by Parvati near Outer Ring Road, Mysuru and offered compensatory allocation of 14 sites at Vijayanagar third stage in the city in 2021.\n\nThe issue came to light following allegations of irregularities at the MUDA. Complaints were filed against Siddaramaiah over the issue. A complaint with the State Election Commission has accused him of hiding the ownership of land by his wife in the election affidavit filed for the 2013 Assembly polls.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_United_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian United Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislative assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijayanagara Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddaramaiah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siddaramaiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Contract_Manufacturing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Contract Manufacturing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/siddaramaiah-1600-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760147", "eventUri": "eng-9760147", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 593, "textEnd": 600}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

They are particularly concerned about what they allege to be a multi-crore corruption issue within the Valmiki Development Corporation.\n\nThe BJP claims that funds meant for the development of Scheduled Caste (SC) communities have been misused for other purposes.\n\nThe protest has garnered attention on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), where the BJP Karnataka account shared, \"The multi-crore corruption of the Valmiki Development Corporation of the corrupt Congress government betrays the scheduled caste communities by using the money meant for the development of SC communities for other purposes. Under the leadership of the state president Shri @BYVijayendra and the leader of the opposition Shri @RAshokaBJP, an hourly sit-in satyagraha was started at Vidhansauda with BJP and JDS members of both Houses.\"\n\n\"We demand the resignation of the chief minister @siddaramaiah, the father of the Muda scam. BJP's struggle will continue until the Scheduled Tribe communities and the poor get justice. Members of the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council including BJP and JDS parties, including Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Mr. @NswamyChalavadi, former National General Secretaries Mr. @CTRavi_BJP, participated in the protest,\" the state BJP added.\n\nState party president Vijayendra has vehemently condemned the alleged MUDA scam and sought the chief minister's resignation.\n\n\"We demand the resignation of the corrupt chief minister, condemn the Mysore Muda scam in which Siddaramaiah is involved, and demand the resignation of the chief minister. An hour-long sit-in satyagraha has been started in the Vidhan Soudha with BJP and JDS members of both houses against the zero-development Congress government, including the multi-crore corruption of the Valmiki Development Corporation,\" Vijayendra posted on X.\n\nVijayendra further elaborated on the nature of the corruption allegations, stating, \"After robbing 187 crores of Maharshi Valmiki Nigam, which was meant for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, MLA B Nagendra, who has already been caught by the ED, is standing in the queue and knocking on the door of the jail.\"\n\nHe also criticized CM Siddaramaiah for allegedly trying to shirk responsibility regarding the Valmiki Development Corporation scam.\n\n\"Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who holds the finance portfolio, is saying that he is not responsible for the protection of Rs 187 crores of Valmiki Corporation, and he knows nothing about this scam. It is a cunning idea to escape from responsibility, which you will get a proper answer to in the course of the investigation,\" Vijayendra stated.\n\n\"You and your government are traitors to the scheduled castes, as you used thousands of crores of rupees, which were supposed to be used only for the welfare of the scheduled castes for other purposes. The scheduled communities will teach you a lesson,\" the BJP leader wrote on X.\n\nContinuing his attack, Vijayendra questioned the government's reluctance to investigate the alleged MUDA scam. \"Why do you hesitate to investigate the illegal plot scam in which more than 5000 plots worth crores of rupees have been given away to the powerful, land grabbers, and influential people and not to those who have been waiting for decades to realize their lifelong dream of having a roof in their home district, Mysore?\"\n\n\"You are the father of this scam, as you have illegally acquired 14 plots of land in the name of your wife, defrauded the family of the real benefit, and defrauded the dignity and honour of the position of the chief minister. It is a shame that you are justifying yourself with corruption, wearing the crown of nepotism,\" he added.\n\nVijayendra also accused the state government of suppressing the right to freedom of expression. \"You are suppressing the right to freedom of expression by not allowing us to fight against your wrongdoings in a democratic way. The speaker dancing to your tune is a black spot in the legislative system,\" he said.\n\nHighlighting the emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Vijayendra said, \"It seems you are going to re-enact the dark context of the emergency in the 70s. Our struggle is not only against your repressive attitude; our struggle will not stop until the government under your leadership, which is trying to darken the democratic system and is protecting corruption, is removed from power.\"\n\nBJP leader Dr CN Ashwath Narayan also voiced his concerns about the scandal, accusing the state government of corruption and constitutional disrespect. \"What happened in MUDA, where more than four thousand crore scams happened, CM and his family are also involved in this. When we asked for discussion, by rejecting it, they disrespected the constitution. That's why the BJP and JDS in the Legislative Council and Assembly are demanding the CM's resignation and discussion, and letting the people know about the MUDA scam. We are protesting by sleeping inside the assembly,\" he said.\n\nThe ongoing protest and accusations underline the intense political climate in Karnataka as BJP MLAs demand accountability and action regarding the allegations of large-scale corruption. The outcome remains to be seen as the protests continue within the legislative assembly.\n\nThe TOI City Desk is an indefatigable team of journalists dedicated to bringing you the pulse of cities from across the nation, all day and all night.

Ashok, stayed back in the Assembly hall while their counterparts in the Council, led by Chalavadi Narayanaswamy, stayed back after the Houses were adjourned for the day and continued their protest. They displayed placards and raised slogans against Mr. Siddaramaiah and demanded his resignation, accusing his family of gaining hold on a piece of land belonging to a Dalit person and later getting alternative sites from MUDA for this land.\n\nThe Opposition resorted to the protest after the presiding officers of both Houses denied them permission to take up a discussion on the alleged irregularities in MUDA citing technical reasons.\n\nIn the Assembly, the Opposition members sought to raise the issue through a censuring clause, while alleging that the irregularities were of the magnitude of \u20b93,000 crore and involved the family of the Chief Minister.\n\nLast-minute probe\n\nThey alleged that the government constituted a judicial commission to look into the alleged irregularities just a few hours before the commencement of the monsoon session of the legislature only to prevent any legislature debate on the issue.\n\nLaw Minister H.K. Patil argued that the issue could not be taken up for discussion as it was not a matter of \"urgent public importance\" as the sites were allotted several years ago to the Chief Minister's wife, Parvathi, in lieu of MUDA taking over her 3.16 acres of land for conversion. After hearing the views of both the Opposition and government, Speaker U.T. Khader denied permission to initiate a debate on the alleged MUDA scam.\n\nAngry with Speaker\n\nAngered by this, the Opposition members accused the Speaker of being partisan while pointing out that just a day ago, he had permitted Congress member K.M. Shivalinge Gowda to discuss issues related to an FIR against the Enforcement Directorate that is probing the irregularities in the Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation. Countering this, Mr. Siddaramaiah told the Opposition members to obey the ruling given by the Speaker and not to precipitate the matter.\n\nAngered by this, the Opposition members began a dharna holding placards. They shouted slogans against the Speaker. However, the Speaker continued with the House transactions and even allowed the government to table six Bills that were not listed in the agenda. In addition to this, three other Bills were adopted and the money Bill too was passed amid the din.\n\nThough the House was adjourned for some time to restore order, that did not help as the Opposition members continued their dharna in the Well when the House resumed. Following this, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day after transacting for some time.\n\nHowever, the protesting Opposition members refused to budge and declared that they would embark on a night-long dharna. The Council too witnessed similar scenes with the House being adjourned once to restore order as the Opposition members resorted to protest demanding resignation of Mr. Siddaramaiah.\n\nBJP leaders issued a media statement in the night saying that they had refused to accept the offer of Mr. Khader to arrange dinner for them.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_United_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian United Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddaramaiah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siddaramaiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Law_and_Justice_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Law and Justice (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valmiki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valmiki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/fa2j4z/article68442582.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Assembly_06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760147", "eventUri": "eng-9760147", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Vijayendra has said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is not in a position to defend himself in connection with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) scam.Speaking on the sidelines of the night-long protest by BJP legislators inside the Assembly on Wednesday, the State BJP President claimed that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had expressed outrage against his party MLAs and Ministers for not coming to his defence in connection with the MUDA scam.\n\n\"There is a situation where ruling party MLAs are not coming to help CM Siddaramaiah. If CM Siddaramaiah is honest, we are urging that a CBI probe be conducted into the MUDA scam. The state government wanted to rein in the ED but got rebuked by the High Court,\" he said.\n\n\"I appeal to CM Siddaramaiah that his government has committed numerous sins. The countdown has begun, and we don't know when he will submit his resignation. We will also protest in this regard and discuss it further,\" he added.\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah, who proudly claims to be the leader of Backward Classes, Dalits and minorities, has shown little concern for them after coming to power in the state.\n\nThe Congress government, led by CM Siddaramaiah, is involved in looting Rs 187 crore in connection with the Tribal Welfare Board scam.\n\n\"In Mysuru, land valued at thousands of crores, nearly 4,000 sites, were allotted to his supporters, stooges, relatives, and his wife by violating all rules. By this, CM Siddaramaiah has done injustice to the poor and middle class\" said State BJP President Vijayendra.\n\nThe Congress government prevented the protest march by the BJP and JD(S) legislators from Bengaluru to Mysuru condemning the MUDA scam.\n\n\"You don't even allow us to discuss the MUDA scam in both Houses of the Assembly. State Law Minister H.K. Patil asks us to submit our grievances to the Inquiry Commission. At that point, CM Siddaramaiah was present in the House. He should have agreed to the debate and challenged us,\" he added.\n\n\"However, CM Siddaramaiah remained silent on the MUDA scam. The CM seems to be under pressure because of his involvement in scams. The Tribal Welfare Board scam would not have happened without the collusion of the CM since he is in charge of the State Finance Ministry,\" said State BJP President Vijayendra.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_United_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian United Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddaramaiah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siddaramaiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Law_and_Justice_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Law and Justice (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/202310163070126-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760147", "eventUri": "eng-9760147", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

It is a cunning idea to escape from responsibility, which you will get a proper answer to in the course of the investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"You and your government are traitors to the Scheduled Castes, as you used thousands of crores of rupees, which were supposed to be used only for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes for other purposes. The Scheduled Communities will teach you a lesson,\" the BJP leader wrote on X.\n\nHe continued his attack on the state government and questioned why they were hesitating to investigate the MUDA scam.\n\n\"Why do you hesitate to investigate the illegal plot scam in which more than 5000 plots worth crores of rupees have been given away to the powerful, land grabbers, and influential people, and not to those who have been waiting for decades to realise their lifelong dream of having a roof in their home district, Mysore,\" the BJP leader said.\n\n\"You are the father of this scam, as you have illegally acquired 14 plots of land in the name of your wife, defrauded the family of the real benefit, and defrauded the dignity and honour of the position of the Chief Minister. It is a shame that you are justifying yourself with corruption, wearing the crown of nepotism,\" he added.\n\n\"You are suppressing the right to freedom of expression by not allowing us to fight against your wrongdoings in a democratic way. The speaker dancing to your tune is a black spot in the legislative system,\" the BJP leader said.\n\nHe further highlighted the Emergency imposed by former PM Indira Gandhi in 1975 and said, \"It seems you are going to re-enact the dark context of the Emergency in the 70s. Our struggle is not only against your repressive attitude, our struggle will not stop until the government under your leadership, which is trying to darken the democratic system and is protecting corruption, is removed from power.\"\n\nBJP leader Dr CN Ashwath Narayan said that they are protesting because the state government rejected it and disrespected the Constitution.\n\n\"What happened in MUDA, where more than four thousand crore scams happened, CM and his family are also involved in this. When we asked for discussion, by rejecting it, they disrespected the constitution. That's why the BJP and JDS in the Legislative Council and Assembly are demanding the CM's resignation and discussion, and letting the people know about the MUDA scam. We are protesting by sleeping inside the assembly,\" he said.

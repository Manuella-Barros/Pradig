He helped them reach the final of the competition in 2021 and played a key part in reaching the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nHowever, he is set to face a summer at home after not making the cut in Southgate's provisional 30-man squad. Rashford will join the likes of Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell in missing out ahead of the tournament in Germany.\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag gives Marcus Rashford update after heated argument with Manchester United fan\n\nREAD MORE: 'Not world class' Marcus Rashford told to leave Man Utd for himself - and the club\n\nAfter scoring 30 goals for United in the 2022/23 season, Rashford has performed way under his best standards in the past 12 months. In one of the worst Premier League seasons in the club's history, the forward managed just eight goals in 42 appearances.\n\nThe blow of missing out on the international tournament is the latest setback for Rashford. With uncertainty over his long-term future at Old Trafford, what is next for the United academy graduate?\n\nMEN Sport writers give their thoughts on Southgate's decision to axe Rashford and where he goes from here.\n\nJosh Holland\n\nIn every tournament squad announcement there is one player that misses out and it's a huge talking point. Marcus Rashford is that case study this season yet it's hardly surprising.\n\nAnyone who has watched United in action this season knows how much the forward has struggled. Despite the minimum moments of quality, he hasn't been good enough and his form warrants a ruthless decision like this.\n\nHe's usually been a nailed-on star for England but his overall game has plummeted. There's no doubt that he is a talented player but there are fears that this could be another chapter in the fall from grace for Rashford.\n\nThe likes of Anthony Gordon, Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins and Jarrod Bowen all come into the tournament on the back of superb individual seasons and are more likely to carry that into the tournament. I've always viewed Rashford as an option off the bench for England, certainly now with Cole Palmer and Phil Foden nailed-on starters, but there are simply better players.\n\nHe must now reassess his options going forward. The blow of missing out for England will hurt but he has to get his club football back on track to prove Southgate wrong.\n\nTom Coley\n\nCan Rashford really argue with this? It looks like Southgate is moving away from some of his tried and tested England picks over the years - yes, Maguire will still be in there but his performances for club and country warrant it more than Rashford, and there is a dearth of options at centre-back compared to going forward - and it feels like a good thing.\n\nThere are too many good players that are in form to ignore. Ollie Watkins as a versatile channel runner and left-wing option over Rashford is a player more clinical and having the time of his life. If that frees up a spot elsewhere for a point of difference maker with Toney, then so be it.\n\nIt has been eight years since Rashford announced himself for England and there can't be many complaints this time around. There has never been such a wealth of attacking talent as ready as this current group. The individual success of the group across Europe has outdone that of previous years.\n\nThe task is now to make this work in a cohesive team and squad environment across four weeks in a major competition. Rashford will miss out and will struggle through the blow like others around him, who knows, it may even push him towards a transfer this summer.\n\nTom Doyle\n\nAlthough Rashford has had a poor season for United, missing Euro 2024 will come as a genuine shock to the player and truly shows how far his stock has fallen.\n\nThe hard truth for Rashford is that Southgate is blessed with generational talents in attack, and he is well down the pecking order - even taking in to account his past successes for both club and country.\n\nSouthgate doggedly stuck by Harry Maguire while the defender lost form and, eventually, the United captaincy, but the England boss never wavered over the centre-back's importance for his country. Could Rashford's off-field exploits have tipped the scales in Southgate's thinking here?\n\nThe simple fact is that players who have had better seasons (and better attitudes) than Rashford are also missing out, so he is not alone in his disappointment - but this is a serious wake-up call at a critical point in his career.\n\nIt is also a warning sign for United that Rashford joins Jadon Sancho in the England wilderness, when the club would have reasonably expected both to be talismanic starters for club and country not too long ago.\n\nRichard Cusack\n\nThere can't be much surprise about Rashford's omission from Southgate's squad, but at the same time it is a shock to see such a big name miss out on a place at Euro 2024\n\nThe big worry for Rashford is that Southgate has finally shown that he is ready to move in a slightly newer direction, with Jordan Henderson missing out too.\n\nSuch are the options on offer to the England boss, Rashford really has to be in form to count on a Euro 2024 spot and that just has not happened this season.\n\nWhat this does now is open up the chance of a move for the player, who will not be in the tournament bubble and the June 30 unofficial FFP deadline is now a very realistic opportunity for United to move him on.\n\nAt 26, Rashford still has a lot to offer but needs to show it more consistently to avoid being left behind altogether.\n\nDominic Booth\n\nTake away any kind of United bias and the simple fact is Marcus Rashford does not merit inclusion in the England squad for Euro 2024.\n\nIt's been a far worse club season for Rashford than anyone could have imagined. His record of seven goals in 33 Premier League appearances, which includes two penalties, actually flatters him.\n\nGareth Southgate has myriad options in Rashford's position so the England boss has done the logical thing and selected other players ahead of the United man. It will always be a big story when a player of Rashford's profile misses out on a tournament, but it's a surprise to nobody that he's missed out this time.\n\nStephen Killen\n\nThe Three Lions boss has been accused to sticking to his favourites and including them in squads, despite a lack of form and/or being out of favour. In what could be his final competition in the hotseat it is a bold move but in terms of Marcus Rashford, it isn't really.\n\nHis United form has been a concern and his role in the England squad has been consistently fading. The likes of Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Jarrod Bowen have emerged as more viable options in the wide-attacking spots plus the emergence of Eberechi Eze - who has been called up - there are more threatening options with better qualities in that department.\n\nYou wonder whether this is the beginning of the end of his international career for England. Unless his club form improves at or away from Old Trafford, you fear it very well may be.\n\nTyrone Marshall\n\nThis isn't the first time Marcus Rashford has been dropped by England. Last season he has fought away back into the squad by enjoying the season of his life at United but that increasingly feels like a one-off.\n\nHis performance levels have plummeted this season and the competition in attacking areas is vibrant. Anthony Gordon has offered more in the Premier League this season and Ivan Toney is a better third-choice striker. That is just where Rashford is at the moment.\n\nIt might be surprising he doesn't have make what is a provisional squad before it's cut to 26, that is probably an indication that he was never going to make it in the 26 so why keep him around now? Maybe the long summer break will help him.\n\nHis body language and off-pitch issues this season are also warning signs when it comes to tournament football, especially for a player who is only likely to be on the fringes. You need good tourists in that situation and it wouldn't be a surprise if Gareth Southgate had concerns about that.\n\nGeorge Smith\n\nWith an embarrassment of riches in attack, Gareth Southgate was going to have to leave someone out. And Marcus Rashford, based on his performances this season, can have no complaints.\n\nHis performance levels have taken a significant nosedive this term, resulting in him scoring just eight goals in all competitions for United. Southgate, correctly, has cited his form as the sole reason behind his commission from the squad and it is impossible to disagree with the England boss.\n\nThe fact he has been left out of the provisional squad ahead of Southgate cutting his final squad down to just 26 players tells you everything about how out of favour he currently is. As painful as it will be for him to watch this summer's tournament from home, you would hope that will serve as his motivation to get his career back on track at Old Trafford next season and reclaim his place in the England squad as soon as possible.\n\nIsaac Seelochan\n\nThe right decision for England and Rashford who could perhaps do with a wake-up call after a season of drift. He's not the only one you could say that about at United of course.\n\nTime will tell if the academy graduate will come anywhere near last season's form again. But make no mistake that if his name wasn't Marcus Rashford then he would be anywhere near the Three Lions squad based on this season's form.\n\nIt came as a surprise to me considering Southgate's previous form of picking player's based on reputation. However, it's a good sign for England that in his final tournament, the England manager has been ruthless in choosing who he takes. Rashford can have no complaints and I'm sure he privately agrees.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chilwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Chilwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29211938.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_marcus-rashford-manchester-united.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 5529, "textEnd": 5536}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Petit believes Rashford is \"miserable\" after enduring a low-scoring season where his on-pitch performances and off-field behaviour have come under scrutiny.\n\nWhile he was undoubtedly United's star player throughout the previous 2022/23 campaign, the Englishman's dismal form has led to rumours surrounding his potential exit in the upcoming transfer window. At 26, with his best years still ahead of him, Petit believes Arsenal is the perfect destination for Rashford to turnaround his fortunes.\n\nThe Frenchman highlighted similarities between Rashford and Kai Havertz's gloomy three years at Chelsea.

A fan reportedly moved down several rows to address him, saying: \"If you wanna go, go\", triggering the player.\n\nArsenal have been linked with a forward who can play in the wide positions in recent months. They are keen to add pace along the front line and cover for Bukayo Saka, though Rashford more regularly plays off the left, which is occupied by Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\n\nShould Arteta be able to unlock Rashford's untapped potential, the Red Devils academy graduate's ability to beat his man and find the net would undoubtedly aid their title pursuit next season.

Focus shifts to FA Cup final vs. Man City.\n\nManchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly not going to be part of England's Euro 2024 provisional squad after enduring a challenging season with the Red Devils.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Gareth Southgate has decided to leave Rashford out of his 30-man provisional squad for the European Championship in Germany, which begins next month. The 26-year-old forward has had a tough time at United this season, managing to score only eight goals across all competitions. This poor performance seems to have cost him a place in the national team for another major tournament.\n\nSouthgate must reduce his squad to 26 players by June 7, the final UEFA deadline. Although Rashford won't make the cut, his Manchester United teammate Kobbie Mainoo is expected to be included on the provisional list, along with Manchester City's Jack Grealish. England has a lot of depth in midfield and wide positions, which makes the competition for places extremely tough.\n\nRashford has been a key player for England, scoring 17 goals in 60 appearances since his debut in 2016. He was part of the squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup, scoring three goals in the tournament. Despite his past contributions, his recent form at Manchester United has seen him lose his place in the national team pecking order.\n\nRashford's contract with Manchester United runs until 2028. However, there are rumors that the club might consider selling him if the right offer comes along, with Paris Saint-Germain reportedly interested. For now, Rashford will focus on finishing the season strong. Manchester United is set to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday, and Rashford will hope to play a significant role in that match.\n\nThis season has been particularly difficult for Rashford, but he will be determined to bounce back and reclaim his spot in the England squad. His talent and previous performances indicate he can still be an important player for Manchester United and the national team.

Focuses on FA Cup final & future with Manchester United.\n\nMarcus Rashford has shown his support for Gareth Southgate and the England team despite not being included in the squad for Euro 2024. This decision came after a challenging season for the Manchester United forward.\n\nSouthgate recently announced his provisional squad for the upcoming tournament, and Rashford was a notable omission. Along with Rashford, Jordan Henderson was also left out, and the squad features five uncapped players. Southgate explained his decision and mentioned that other players had better seasons than the 26-year-old Rashford.\n\nManchester United's Struggles\n\nThis season has been tough for Manchester United, and Rashford has felt the impact. The team was eliminated from the Champions League in the group stages and finished eighth in the Premier League. Although they have reached the FA Cup final, set to play against Manchester City on Saturday, the overall campaign has disappointed the Red Devils.\n\nRashford's performance could have been better. He has scored only seven goals in the Premier League this season. This lack of form has contributed to his exclusion from the national squad, as Southgate prioritized players with more successful seasons.\n\nRashford's disappointment is evident. As an integral part of the England squad in recent years, being left out of a major tournament is a significant setback. However, his reaction has been nothing short of professional and supportive.\n\nRashford took to social media to respond to the news of his omission. He posted an image of the England squad list on Instagram and included a supportive message: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\" Despite his disappointment, Rashford remains positive and supportive of his teammates.\n\nThe forward is focused on ending the season on a high note by winning the FA Cup with Manchester United. A victory in the final against their city rivals would be a bright spot in an otherwise tough season. This upcoming match is not just an opportunity for silverware but for Rashford to showcase his talent and resilience.\n\nLooking ahead, Rashford will have a rare summer off since he won't be participating in the Euro 2024 tournament. This break could give him much-needed rest and the chance to reflect on his future. He is expected to talk with Sir Jim Ratcliffe regarding his role and future at Manchester United.\n\nRashford's absence from the England squad is significant, but it also presents an opportunity for him to regroup and return stronger next season. Manchester United fans will hope that the forward can find his best form again and help the team achieve better results.\n\nDespite the setback, Rashford has shown great maturity and sportsmanship. His public support for the England team demonstrates his character and commitment to the sport. This period of rest and reflection could be exactly what Rashford needs to recharge and prepare for the next season.\n\nRashford's exclusion from the England squad for Euro 2024 disappoints him and his fans. However, his response has been gracious and supportive. The Manchester United star now has the chance to focus on his club's upcoming FA Cup final and take some time to rest and plan for the future. Rashford and Manchester United will aim for a more successful campaign next season.

The squad is set to be announced in full at 2pm on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn total, Rashford has won 61 caps for England and scored 17 goals since making his Three Lions debut back in 2016. He did feature in Southgate's most recent England squad and made a 15 minute cameo against Brazil at Wembley.\n\nOther big names who are reportedly set to miss out on a place in the squad ahead of this summer's tournament include Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling. Chelsea duo Ben Chilwell and Reece James are also expected to miss the cut after struggling with injuries this season.\n\nRashford enjoyed a career-best campaign last year when he plundered 30 goals for Manchester United but has scored just eight goals in 42 appearances this term.\n\nJoin the debate! Do you think Rashford should be in the squad? Let us know here.\n\nUnited manager Erik ten Hag insisted last month that Rashford needed support in the wake of his struggles on the pitch and urged fans to stick with him ahead of the summer.\n\nThe Dutchman said: \"I've a lot of sympathy for Rashy, of course. Last year, he had a brilliant season. I think the best season in his career, he scored 30 goals [in all competitions]. You see what he is capable of.\n\n\"This season, he didn't give the performances and people have been very critical. We have to back him and everyone should back him to get back to the levels of last year.\n\n\"I think he needs the support. We all know what he's capable of, we all have to support and push him. He can do better than this year. We saw last year when he was really brilliant.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

At 26, a year after the season of his life, he has not made the provisional 33-man squad, let alone the final cut. The rise of Rashford was initially a swift, startling affair. If last season brought the resurgence of Rashford, with a career-best 30 goals, this brought a sudden, shocking fall that has led to a further precipitous drop, out of England contention.\n\nSome 12 players were listed as forwards in Gareth Southgate's training squad for Euro 2024. Rashford was not one of them. \"With Marcus, I just feel other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons. It's as simple as that,\" he said. The comparison with Jarrod Bowen, scorer of 20 goals for West Ham, or Anthony Gordon, in double figures for Premier League goals and assists, did not flatter Rashford. He was overtaken by the emergence of Cole Palmer, who delivered 25 goals and 14 assists in a remarkable campaign for Chelsea, and the end-of-season flourish from Eberechi Eze, who scored five times in his last six games for Crystal Palace.\n\nBut the warning signs were there before then and they went unheeded. Rashford only got 15 minutes as a substitute in England's March friendlies; Bowen got 103 over the two games and Gordon 85. If the temptation was to think that Southgate had little more to learn about a player who has won 57 of his 60 caps in his reign, it was not merely a fact-finding expedition about two inexperienced players. Southgate had advised Rashford his place might be at risk. He then regressed when progress was required.\n\n\"I did talk a bit with him in March about his season [and] others who have been playing very well in that area of the pitch,\" he said. Rashford arrived then in his best run of form of the season, scoring in three consecutive matches for Manchester United. Since that international break, Rashford has missed matches with minor injuries. But he has also failed to find the net in eight matches for his club; Palmer alone has nine goals in that time, sealing his own place in Southgate's squad after missing the Brazil and Belgium games in March. Southgate has been blown away. \"We believe the Gordons and the Bowens have had brilliant seasons,\" he said. \"We liked the hunger that they came in with in March. That gives a different dynamic to training and competition for places. It doesn't allow complacency within the group.\"\n\nNow there is no place for Rashford in the group. And so it fell to the England manager to deliver bad news. \"He was really respectful,\" Southgate said. \"I said to him: 'You've got to go and score a couple of goals at the weekend now and put things right.'\" The probability, though, is that Rashford will be on the bench for the FA Cup final; Alejandro Garnacho is now Erik ten Hag's first-choice left winger. For club, as well as country, Rashford seems overtaken by the next generation, the oldest 26-year-old in the business risking becoming the past at a tender age.\n\n\"He wants to play for England, he loves playing for England and the opportunity to play in tournaments is why you play international football,\" said Southgate. If Rashford is suffering from extraordinary competition for places on the flanks in England's attack, there is the sense two tournaments have brought opposing experiences: first came the heart-warming return, when he timed his burst into the 2022 World Cup squad and scored a minute into his tournament; then, after his glorious goal against Italy helped seal England's place in Euro 2024, Rashford will miss it.\n\nHe is young enough to figure in Euro 2028, perhaps even Euro 2032. But a possibility is his last kick of a ball in the European Championships is the penalty he put against the post in the final shootout against Italy three years ago: brought on as a specialist spot-kick taker and auxiliary right-back, his cameo brought heartbreak. Then, hideously, racial abuse. He has often been scapegoated. He may be again; as with Jordan Henderson, there may be some schadenfreude about his fall.\n\n\"You are conscious for Marcus and Hendo really of the impact because they are two people who externally, they have people jump on them very quickly and I think they know I am there to support them,\" said Southgate.\n\nBut there are precedents, talismanic figures who have been pensioned off before. Rashford's England career is not necessarily over at 26; but there is no guarantee of another act. Raheem Sterling has not been called up since the World Cup; he may not be again. Southgate can be ruthless but not, he would argue, cruelly so.\n\n\"I would hope not brutal because I think the players would accept they've been supported at certain moments,\" he said. \"We've had to evolve. We had to clear space for other people to come through. The job is about making difficult decisions at certain times. You can't shy away from that. I don't think I ever have. They're hard conversations but you do them as respectfully as you can.\" Now he hasn't shied away from a decision about Rashford, and his wretched season has taken a turn for the worse.", "source":

Whatever it is, it is the wrong call.\n\nNo matter how poor Rashford has been this season, a 26-man allowance gives Southgate the chance of a luxury pick, a gamble, an option he is not quite certain of, or a loyalty pick.\n\nDespite his previous support - and despite the 57 caps he has given him - Southgate has never been as ardent a supporter of Rashford as most would imagine.\n\nHe may have taken Rashford to three tournaments but this England manager has only given him two starts in those tournaments - and both of those came when qualification from the group stage had already been secured (against Belgium at Russia 2018 and against Wales at Qatar 2022, when he scored twice).\n\nIn his first game as England manager - a home win over Malta on October 8, 2016 - Southgate used Rashford as a substitute and has done the same on THIRTY-ONE occasions since.\n\nOf Rashford's 60 caps - three were under Roy Hodgson - only 26 have been starts.\n\nAnd Southgate cannot have been impressed when Rashford, 26, pulled out of a squad for a couple of Euro 2024 qualifiers early last year, only to then post social media pictures of himself holidaying in New York.\n\nBut impact substitutes at major championships can be absolutely invaluable and that is exactly the role Rashford should have fulfilled in Germany this summer.\n\nYes, there is a lot of attacking brilliance in Southgate's squad but, even in this slump, Rashford remains a player whose speed, strength and skill is not what a tired defender wants to see being introduced late in a match.\n\nBefore the squad is trimmed to an unnecessary 26, he should have at least been given the chance to show Southgate, in training at St George's Park and in the upcoming friendlies, that he was suitably fired up - fired up by reaction to his poor season, fired up by criticism of some elements of his lifestyle, fired up by suggestions he might not be as fully committed to the England cause as some.\n\nBut the United man has not been given the chance to show that a fired-up Rashford is a weapon that Southgate, for all his riches in the attacking department, should not leave at home.\n\nMaybe it is a bold call, maybe it is a brave call, and many will think it is a correct call.\n\nAnd for those of us who disagree with it, at least it is a reminder that England must have one hell of a squad if Marcus Rashford cannot get into it.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

After the second and final warm-up game - which is on Friday, June 7 - Southgate will trim that contingent to 26 ahead of the tournament in Germany.\n\nEven though Southgate has decided to utilise a larger-than-normal squad for their training camp, Rashford has still not been included. The 26-year-old has endured a difficult season at Manchester United, scoring just eight goals in 42 appearances. However, he has featured in each of the last four major tournaments and impressed for England at the World Cup in Qatar, notably scoring in the 3-0 win over Wales.\n\nExplaining his decision to not chose Rashford, Southgate said in a press conference: \"These are difficult calls. With Marcus I just feel other players in that area have had better seasons. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nNow, Rashford has taken to Instagram to react after not being included in the training squad for Euro 2024. In an Instagram story which included a graphic of the 33 players selected, Rashford said: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\"\n\nInstead of Rashford, the forwards Southgate has chosen to take include Jude Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Anthony Gordon, Harry Kane, James Maddison, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins. There is no place for Raheem Sterling or Dominic Solanke.\n\nSouthgate has taken the opportunity to select youth in his training squad, with Crystal Palace duo Eze and Adam Wharton, as well as Liverpool's Jarrel Quansah, Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite named ahead of friendlies against Bosnia and Iceland.\n\nAlong with Rashford, the other most high-profile absentee was Jordan Henderson. The Ajax midfielder has endured a difficult season and misses his first major tournament since being picked for Euro 2012.\n\nWhen asked about why Henderson was not included in the squad, Southgate said: \"He given himself every chance. The determining factor was the injury he picked up in the last camp. He missed five weeks and wasn't able to get back up to the level of intensity. It was a difficult decision.\"\n\nElaborating on the omission of Henderson, he continued: \"He will be a miss. He's an exceptional individual and fantastic human being. He's been in that leadership role for a long time. We've got young players with a lot of caps. There's no reason why young players can't lead.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nFifteen words, posted half an hour after midnight, that said much about his situation.\n\nIt isn't the first time Rashford has had to defend himself this season. In February, he wrote a first-person piece for The Players' Tribune.\n\n'I can take any criticism,' wrote Rashford. 'But if you start questioning my commitment to this club and my love for football and bringing my family into it, then I'd simply ask you to have a bit more humanity.'\n\nHis mother Melanie Maynard even penned a piece for The Times explaining that he had lost two people close to him over the last 18 months, his cousin Nathan and a family friend called Garf.\n\n'Marcus is human, so he will have ups and downs in his life like everyone else,' she wrote.\n\nSafe to say, none of it will cut much ice with his critics.\n\nRashford suggested that some of the ill-feeling was rooted in the pandemic and his crusade to fight child food poverty which earned him an MBE. The backlash against his now infamous tequila bender in Belfast came from people waiting for him to have 'a human moment', he claimed.\n\nSadly, there will always be a moronic element hiding under a rock; the kind of people who racially abused Rashford and his England team-mates Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho after they missed penalties in the shootout to decide the final of Euro 2020.\n\nIn April, Rashford fired back at his Manchester United critics in a fiery post on his social media\n\nDuring April's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry, Rashford left the field with an injury and was met by a chorus of boos from a minority of Manchester United fans at Wembley\n\nIn response, he thanked fans online for their support before stating that he had 'had enough'\n\nRashford is a young man who has risen from a poor upbringing in Wythenshawe to earn a basic \u00a3315,000-a-week - more than \u00a3350,000 if he and the team hit their bonus targets - build a multi-million pound house with its own golf course, and own a fleet of luxury cars.\n\nHis mother and two brothers, Dwaine Maynard and Dane Rashford, who also represent him, are well provided for. Envy festers easily among the idiots.\n\nBut to paint Rashford as innocent victim here perhaps misses the point. As a world-famous footballer playing for one of the biggest clubs on the planet, he should not be exempt from criticism and, goodness knows, he has given the snipers plenty of ammunition.\n\nThe jaw-dropping new contract last summer came on the back of a 30-goal season for United. His stats this season are hardly likely to send the Opta computer system into meltdown.\n\nThree goals in a row in March against Manchester City, Everton and Liverpool suggested that he was hitting a rich vein of form. However, Rashford has fired blanks in his next seven games, starting four of them on the bench. His chances of making the England squad for Euro 2024 were looking shaky long before Gareth Southgate made his announcement on Tuesday.\n\nMultiple times this season, Rashford has lashed out at his doubters via lengthy statements\n\nIn the past, the Man United forward has run several campaigns to end childhood poverty\n\nWhen some forwards aren't scoring, they make up for it with an abundance of effort. Rasmus Hojlund is a good example of this, and he has scored twice off the bench in the last two games against Newcastle and Brighton while his team-mate has struggled to make any impression at all.\n\nThere are times, though, when it feels like Rashford couldn't do a better impersonation of someone who didn't care less if he tried. Those times when he comes across as the polar opposite of the young man he wrote about in The Players' Tribune, living out his dream for his boyhood club and challenging anyone to question his commitment.\n\nThose close to Rashford say he is an individual who wears his heart on his sleeve and struggles to hide his emotions. Shy by nature, he can come across as sulky and sullen.\n\nBut manager Erik ten Hag and United supporters expect their players to put in a shift. To press and chase. There are too many clips of Rashford making half-hearted attempts to pressure opponents or track back to simply dismiss it as unfair criticism.\n\nYour mind goes back to the FA Cup tie against Aston Villa in January 2022 when Rashford was booed by his own fans at Old Trafford for not making the effort to chase a loose ball. That was a nadir in his United career and it feels like we have reached another low point now.\n\nRashford scored a career-best 30 goals last season, but has not replicated the form this season\n\nThat is not the case this season, with the forward scoring just eight goals in 42 United games\n\nThere have been rumblings of discontent towards him in games against Brentford, City and Chelsea this season, and they surfaced again at Wembley. It has raised the almost unthinkable question: would United consider selling Rashford this summer?\n\nWith 100 per cent of the profit from trading homegrown players going towards complying with financial fair play regulations, it would have to be an option - particularly with new co-owners Ineos committed to a fierce economy drive that could see a number of other big earners leave at the end of the season.\n\nParis-Saint Germain, who held talks with Rashford's representatives two years ago, are one of few clubs who could realistically meet Rashford's \u00a375million valuation and match his personal terms as they seek to replace Kylian Mbappe.\n\nUnited continue to believe in Rashford and want him to succeed at Old Trafford after investing so heavily in him with the new contract. But there is also a recognition that something needs to change and it must be a two-way process.\n\nTen Hag has backed the player, even though his drop in form is one of several factors that have undermined the Dutchman's second season, but the feeling is that Rashford needs to show a desire to stay at United and fight for his future.\n\nMan United are now faced with the unthinkable question of whether it's worth selling Rashford\n\nErik ten Hag (left) has backed Rashford but has not been repaid in the faith placed in the star\n\nSome fans would not be sorry to see the back of him. But in a summer of significant churn, when Anthony Martial could feasibly be followed out of the club by Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood, ideally United don't really want to be having to find another new forward.\n\nIf Rashford's impact on the pitch has dwindled, then what about his reputation off it?\n\nThe wholesome homegrown hero who campaigned against child food poverty and seemed set for life with his childhood sweetheart, is more likely to make the news these days for the wrong reasons.\n\nThere was the ill-judged 26th birthday celebration at China White nightspot in October, just hours after United were well beaten by City in the Old Trafford derby. A month earlier, his \u00a3700,000 Rolls Royce was written off in a crash close to the training ground. This year, he has been pictured peeling parking tickets off his McLaren sports car and Lamborghini Urus after leaving them on double yellow lines.\n\nNot the worst sins in the world. But at times it has felt like Rashford is turning into the brash football star we hoped he wasn't.\n\nRashford (left) pictured getting into his \u00a3700,000 Rolls Royce - which he later wrote off\n\nThe forward crashed the luxury car outside United's training ground before selling it for cheap\n\nPerhaps a more accurate image is painted by Sarah Adair, the waitress who accompanied him on his bar crawl around Belfast in January which ended with him missing training and being disciplined by Ten Hag.\n\nOn the one hand, we had the superstar flying in by private jet with his entourage - 'his friends treated him like he was a god' - dripping in designer jewellery including two diamond encrusted watches, getting so drunk that he was incapable of doing the job for which he is so richly rewarded, and then fibbing to his club about the night out.\n\nOn the other, Miss Adair perceived something in Rashford that maybe others don't. 'Marcus was confident but also seemed a bit shy. It's as though he doesn't really know who he is,' she observed.\n\nUnited have harboured concerns over Rashford's lifestyle for some time, and his mother wrote ominously about people around him being 'wolves dressed in sheep's clothing'.\n\nIt was always felt that his girlfriend Lucia Loi was a steadying influence, even during the times they weren't together, before they split up for good. Rashford has changed PR representatives twice since then, but positive spin will only get you so far.\n\nRashford faced criticism after he was spotted going into a Belfast nightclub late at night, in January, despite having a training session at United the following morning\n\nHe needs to get back to what he does best, the one thing he has always loved more than anything else. Eight years after making his debuts for United and England in 2016, he should be in the prime of his life and at the peak of his career.\n\nAs he reaches what feels like another crossroads, we are

Rashford, 26, was the big-name omission while Jordan Henderson and Ben Chilwell were the other major calls plus there was no place for Raheem Sterling.\n\nUnited striker Rashford, who has scored 17 goals in 60 caps and played in four major tournaments, has suffered a huge drop in form for his club and is even sweating on his place for the FA Cup final on Saturday. Southgate said: \"He will be hugely disappointed. He wants to play for England, he loves playing for England and the opportunity to play in tournaments is why you play international football.\n\n\"But again he was really respectful. I said to him: 'You've got to go and score a couple of goals at the weekend now and put things right.'\n\n\"You are conscious for Marcus and Hendo really of the impact because they are two people who externally, they have people jump on them very quickly. And I think they know I am there to support them.\n\n\"Even though this has been a difficult conversation, both were really professional, really respectful. But of course I am aware that that creates a bit more drama in their lives which I don't want them to experience but is a reality of the decision I've made.\"\n\nRashford now faces an uncertain future on his own club form as he has not scored for United since March 17 with a growing belief he could move this summer after a disappointing campaign. He took to social media to insist there were no hard feelings as he wrote: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\"\n\nSouthgate did stress that it was a training squad and that he needs 22 players to take part with both the Manchester United and City players involved in the FA Cup final plus Real Madrid 's Jude Bellingham will not be involved until after the Champions League final.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY: Has Southgate made the right call in dropping Rashford? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nEngland plan to give City and United players an extra week's rest after Wembley while Bellingham will not play for the Three Lions until the tournament itself. Liverpool duo Curtis Jones and Jarell Quansah plus Crystal Palace 's Adam Wharton were the new call-ups but there are major doubts on United left-back Luke Shaw.\n\nThe squad gets trimmed from 33 to 26 on Saturday June 8 after the two friendlies with Bosnia & Herzegovina and Iceland before they fly to Germany two days later. Southgate added on Shaw: \"He is a long shot. He is up against it. He's working with the medical team. Erik ten Hag will be able to update you more on that as their week progresses because Manchester United have a final on Saturday.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Rashford hasn't had the best of times with Manchester United last season.\n\nRashford only scored 7 goals for his club, which was marred by issues both on and off the field.

The England manager said the process of picking the players was very complicated for him.\n\n\"These are difficult calls. With Marcus I just feel other players in that area have had better seasons. It's as simple as that,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"This has been as complicated a group as I can remember picking.\"\n\nMichael Owen said he was surprised to see Southgate leave Rashford out of his squad.

Jordan Henderson, Ben Chilwell, Raheem Sterling, and Kalvin Phillips are also absent. While England's core remains in tact, there's scope for a new crop of players to step up and deliver in Germany this summer.\n\nRashford may never have asserted himself as a regular starter for his country, but he's been almost ubiquitous in and around the England set-up even since his teenage emergence. Thus, while his 2023/24 campaign has been a disappointment, his omission is still somewhat of a surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Marcus, I just feel that other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons,\u00e2\u20ac the England boss said after Tuesday's squad announcement.\n\nIn his place, Southgate has pivoted to Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer, while familiar stars Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, and Jack Grealish have also been included in the provisional squad.\n\nRashford can have no complaints, even if Grealish has also struggled to replicate his 2022/23 brilliance. The Man Utd winger has scored just eight times in all competitions this season having netted on 30 occasions last term.\n\nIt's been a campaign of tumult for Rashford which is set to conclude with a whimper. A start in the FA Cup final is unlikely with the winger struggling to get on the pitch over the past six weeks. His relationship with Erik ten Hag and the United supporters has deteriorated, so much so that a departure isn't out of the question this summer.\n\n2023/24 has followed the pattern of Rashford's streaky career. At his best, only few are more destructive from wide areas, but he can appear almost forlorn and devoid of interest amid lean periods of form. The latter iteration of Rashford has manifested more often than not this term, and he's always had a battle on his hands, given the rise of Gordon, in particular, to make England's Euro 2024 squad.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wants to play for England, he loves playing for England and the opportunity to play in tournaments is why you play international football,\u00e2\u20ac Southgate added on Rashford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said to him, \u00e2\u20ac~You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to go and score a couple of goals at the weekend now [against Manchester City in the FA Cup final] and put things right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\"\n\nRashford will doubtlessly be gutted to miss out this summer, but the winger reacted astutely to his omission. \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nA combination of poor form and injuries meant Rashford didn't play for the Three Lions for 16 months ahead of the 2022 World Cup. He joined the squad in Qatar, scoring in two group-stage games against Iran and Wales.\n\nThus, his Euro 2024 omission is certainly not his first international setback, although the wealth of English talent in wide areas means Rashford must fight to regain his place.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chilwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Chilwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4896,h_2754,x_0,y_106/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hyfryf8dd213vkg73m.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

His absence from the European Championships means an exit path is there for Rashford should he wish to take it and ultimately there are benefits to both courses of action.\n\nShould he stay, Rashford would remain a crowd favourite which was evident by the debacle we saw at the last home game of the season.

Harry Kane's missed penalty was the biggest 'if only' but the delay over Rashford was another.\n\nHis call-up to the tournament, after a period in the international wilderness, came in the middle of a dazzling season for Manchester United in which he struck 30 goals in all competitions, winning their Player of the Year award and earning a new five-year deal.\n\nHow quickly things have changed. Less than a year on, Rashford, seemingly facing an uncertain future at Manchester United, is on the outside again, with Southgate finding no room for him even in his extended provisional squad for Euro 2024 that could include over 30 players.\n\nA player who lit up England's last major tournament appearance only a year and a half ago, ostensibly in his prime at 26 years old, will play no part in this one at all.\n\nThe most damning thing is that it does not come as too much of a surprise. Rashford is not the only Manchester United player to have suffered a loss of form this season. But his has been especially stark given the heights he was scaling previously.\n\nIn total, there have been only eight goals and five assists in 42 appearances, his Premier League productivity dropping to its lowest point since the 2016/17 campaign. And that is saying something given the extent of his struggles in 2021/22.\n\nOf course, it is not easy to shine in such a dysfunctional United team. Rashford has clearly lacked the thrust and confidence of last season. But there is an argument that, to some extent, his struggles are symptomatic of the circumstances surrounding the side.\n\nRashford was so prolific last season partly because he played nearly as many minutes up front as he did on the left. With Rasmus Hojlund added in the summer, the ratio has changed.\n\nRashford's shot maps show he is getting far fewer opportunities, particularly in the most dangerous positions. Consider the fact he has only had one effort in the six-yard box, down from 11 last season. His overall numbers for shots per 90 minutes are down by a third.\n\nIt is more difficult to find mitigating circumstances, though, when it comes to his off-the-ball work. Rashford's work rate came under scrutiny after a clip of some half-hearted pressing against Luton in February went viral and the numbers show a drop-off generally.\n\nAccording to Opta, Rashford is making fewer pressures and fewer pressures in the final third. Tracking data shows he is covering slightly more ground but averaging fewer sprints than in any of the previous three seasons. His intensity has plainly dropped.\n\n\"I don't know how to say this but there's something not right,\" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville in April. \"He's not right. And it's not just a case of he's not playing football well, he doesn't look happy.\"\n\nHis relationship with some sections of the Manchester United fanbase has become increasingly strained.\n\nHis last start, in last month's shootout win over Coventry in the FA Cup semi-final, ended with him being booed off by some supporters when he was substituted with an apparent injury following the latest in a long line of ineffectual displays.\n\nWhen he eventually returned to the Manchester United squad, as a substitute for the recent win over Newcastle, he was involved in a heated argument with a fan while warming up.\n\nHis on-field struggles have come to a backdrop of disciplinary issues, including an unsanctioned trip to Belfast in February, after which he reported ill to training, and a trip to a nightclub after defeat to Manchester City in October, for which he had to apologise.\n\nRashford sought to defend himself afterwards, admitting he had made mistakes in an article on The Players' Tribune, but rejecting accusations over a lack of commitment to Manchester United and questioning his treatment by some sections of the media.\n\nCertainly, Rashford is more closely scrutinised than most players. There can be no justification whatsoever for some of the abuse meted out to him, particularly on social media, dating back to his penalty miss in the final of Euro 2020 against Italy.\n\nA period out of the international side followed that tournament, but Southgate stuck by him in the wake of the World Cup, even in the context of poor performances in the first half of this season, naming him in his squads in September, October, November and then, most recently, for England's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium in March.\n\nLooking back, though, it was probably telling that his only minutes in those games came in the form of a 15-minute cameo against Brazil.\n\nSouthgate has now added Anthony Gordon to his options on the left. He has to find a way to include Manchester City's Phil Foden in his starting line-up. Jack Grealish is still valued and there is an emergent Cole Palmer to consider too.\n\nAll of which has left Rashford by the wayside. His electrifying talent was clearer than ever during England's last major tournament appearance. But it will not feature at all at this one. In truth, it has not been apparent all season.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rashford played a key role in the Three Lions' 2022 World Cup campaign, shining brightly amongst a litany of seasoned stars in Qatar and helping England to reach the quarter-finals.\n\nYet, where Rashford was relishing a career-best campaign last term as he plundered 30 goals, this season the forward slumped to just eight goals in 42 appearances during a torrid season with United, who finished eighth in the Premier League, the club's lowest top-flight finish since 1989-90.\n\nAnd Southgate laid out uncomplicated rationale for denying Rashford a place on the plane to Germany.\n\n\"These are difficult calls,\" the England boss said on Tuesday. \"With Marcus I just feel other players in that area have had better seasons. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe downturn in form has been stark, with fans and pundits alike calling for Rashford to depart the club for both parties' sake.\n\nMeanwhile, the forwards Southgate has called upon have arguably endured finer form that Rashford and include Jude Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Anthony Gordon, Harry Kane, James Maddison, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney and Ollie Watkins.\n\nJoin the debate! Do you think Rashford should be in the squad? Let us know here.\n\nSouthgate has also chosen to take the opportunity to look to the future, calling on Eberechi Eze and his Crystal Palace team-mate Scott Wharton, Liverpool's Jarrel Quansah and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite ahead of upcoming friendlies against Bosnia and Iceland.\n\nThe 33-player squad is set to be culled heavily in the days leading up to the tournament. And Southgate added that United's woes on the pitch were not exclusive to Rashford's exclusion, as his United teammate Luke Shaw could see a place on the plane pass him by as well.\n\n\"[Luke Shaw's] up against it,\" Southgate said. \"He's missed a lot of football. The fact that he has been our first choice in that position, we've probably given him a lot longer than we would have done. I'm not sure what's realistic at this time. I have to say, he's a long shot.\"\n\nRashford has won 61 caps for England and netted 17 times since making his Three Lions debut in 2016. His most recent England cameo arrived in a 15-minute stint against Brazil at Wembley Stadium in Southgate's previous call-up.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

Petit believes Rashford is \"miserable\" at Old Trafford after a torrid season where he has been criticised for his on-pitch form and behaviour off it.\n\nHaving arguably been United's best player throughout the 2022/23 campaign, Rashford's season-long slump has sparked speculation about his future with the transfer window looming. Aged 26 with his best years still ahead, Petit sees Arsenal as an ideal place for Rashford - who has been left out Gareth Southgate's provisional England squad for Euro 2024 - to fulfil his potential, reports Football London.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United transfer news live shock Marcus Rashford decision 'made' plus Kieran McKenna latest\n\nREAD MORE: I coached Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho aged 17 - more Man United debuts will follow\n\nPetit drew parallels between Rashford's situation and Kai Havertz's tough three-year spell at Chelsea. Having seemed a shadow of himself at Stamford Bridge, Havertz won over fans at the Emirates Stadium this season by netting 13 goals in the league.\n\nSpeaking to BoyleSports, who offer the latest Euro 2024 betting odds, Petit said: \"I know Kai Havertz has improved massively at Arsenal, but it's difficult to say whether Arteta could do the same with Rashford if he moved to the club.\n\n\"However, I have no doubt that Rashford needs a new start and I think Arsenal could be perfect for him. We all know the quality of Rashford for what he's done in years at Man United, but everyone questioned Havertz and his position when he moved from Chelsea. Would Rashford be good at Arsenal? Give me the paper, and let me sign it for him right now!\n\n\"Rashford in a good environment would be incredible for the Gunners as they all look miserable at United. I saw what happened with the fan and I understand his frustration, so if Rashford wants to leave, he's more than welcome at Arsenal and the door is open for him.\"\n\nHe added: \"Havertz was in a strange environment at Chelsea and he wasn't happy, but he has smiled at Arsenal and I can finally see his teeth - I want that for Rashford.\"\n\nA heated exchange between Rashford and a United fan before their win against Newcastle last week summed up the player's mood. Rashford reacted furiously after the supporter in question reportedly moved down several rows and told him: \"If you wanna go, go\".\n\nArsenal are expected to sign a new forward this summer capable of playing in the wide positions, adding pace to their front line and providing competition for Bukayo Saka. However, Rashford primarily operates from the left flank, currently filled by Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\n\nShould Arteta successfully manage to unlock Rashford's potential, the Red Devils academy graduate's skill in beating defenders and finding the net would play a huge role in Arsenal's title pursuit next season. He scored 17 league goals during the 2022/23 season, with a tally of 30 across all competitions.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kasra_moradi@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Kasra Moradi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Petit", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Petit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Martinelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Martinelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29212116.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_fbl-eng-pr-man-utd-chelsea.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It's as simple as that.\"\n\nRashford reacted to his England snub on social media, writing on his Instagram story: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\"\n\nThe other significant absentee from the England squad was Henderson, who has endured a turbulent club season. The former Liverpool captain joined Saudi Arabia club Al Ettifaq last summer and despite keeping his place in the Three Lions team, he then moved to Ajax in the January transfer window.\n\n\"Hendo has given himself every chance,\" said Southgate. \"The determining factor is the injury he picked up at the last camp [in March]. He has missed five weeks and just hasn't been able to get to the intensity in the game since then.\n\n\"He's a fantastic professional, it was a difficult call to make as he's been so important and supportive in my time.\n\n\"All the boys I have spoken to: Ben [Chilwell], Marcus and Jordan - who were all with us last time - were all incredibly professional and considering the disappointment, they dealt with it well.\"\n\nSouthgate has named 33 players for an England training camp ahead of friendlies with Bosnia & Herzegovina and Iceland in early June, but has to reduce that number to 26 players by 11pm on June 7 - nine days before the Three Lions' tournament opener against Serbia.\n\nThe England manager called up left-back Luke Shaw despite a muscle injury keeping the defender out since the middle of February.\n\nSouthgate delivered the worrying news that Shaw, who is England's first-choice option at left-back, is a serious doubt to take part in the tournament.\n\n\"I have to say he is up against it - he's missed a lot of football,\" Southgate said on Shaw's fitness.\n\n\"The fact he's been first choice in that position , we're probably giving him longer than we might have done. I'm not sure what is realistic at this moment in time.\n\n\"I've talked with him, the medical team are liaising with Man Utd closely. But I would have to say he is a long shot.\"\n\nEngland go into this tournament having come agonisingly close to winning the trophy three years ago, when the Three Lions were beaten by Italy on penalties in the Wembley final.\n\nAsked if his side are capable of going one step further, the England manager replied: \"I'd be an idiot if I said no, but if I said yes, that doesn't mean there's not a lot of work ahead of us.\n\n\"There's no doubt what is possible. The team has been close already. They know what is possible, they know what they've won at club level and what that's taken.\n\n\"And equally, you can see cup football, which we're going into, we know you have to navigate game by game and qualify from the group.\n\n\"But in knockout football, the Champions League showed that Man City and Arsenal were in the best three teams this year and didn't get to where they wanted to, as it's one moment and fine margins.\n\n\"That is our world. You have to deliver on those moments. But are we one of those teams who can win? Of course, absolutely.\"\n\nSky Sports' Paul Merson:\n\n\"It's huge news. Sixty caps, been in tournaments, scores goals and you can rely on him. If it was any other time you'd probably say it was not a shock, but Gareth picks people out of form - he picks people even if they aren't in their team.\n\n\"I am really shocked. He hasn't been good, but tournament football is so different to [club football]. It's like no other type of football.\n\n\"He's just left out 140 caps in the blink of an eye with Henderson and Rashford. When Rashford gets hot, he gets hot and you need that in tournament football.\n\n\"I like Eze, I just don't think he is going to play in front of Foden. If you're watching the game and there are 65 minutes gone and England are behind - who do you go for to bring off the bench?\n\n\"Rashford, who has done it before and has sixty caps, or someone who has never played in a tournament before? You're going with Rashford. And that's what shocks me. I think you could take both of them.\"\n\nAll times BST\n\nMonday June 3 - International friendly, England vs Bosnia and Herzegovina at St James' Park, kick-off 7.45pm\n\nFriday June 7 - international

with footage showing him confronting a heckler at Old Trafford last week.\n\nAnd the goal drought has been accompanied by some off-pitch antics, including a 'tequila bender' in Belfast hours before he was due for a Friday training session.\n\nThe footballer, who has been lauded in recent years for his charity work and received an MBE for his efforts to tackle food poverty, put on a brave face on today's snub, writing on Instagram: 'Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.'\n\nMarcus Rashford after being appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2021\n\nRashford posing with friends during a controversial night out in Belfast earlier this year\n\nRashford put on a brave face on today's snub, writing on Instagram: 'Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament'\n\nRashford only netted seven goals and two assists during the 2023-24 Premier League season, and Southgate insisted his omission was solely down to his performances on the pitch.\n\n'With Marcus I just feel that players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons, it's as simple as that,' he said.\n\nRead More Marcus Rashford breaks his silence with 14-word response after being axed from England's Euro 2024 training camp by Gareth Southgate\n\nThe attacker's struggles have frustrated some United fans, and this has sometimes spilled over into abuse.\n\nLast Wednesday, he was seen walking away from his teammates to argue with a member of the crowd, before they ushered him back from the touchline.\n\nOne fan could be overheard telling those sat near to a group of photographers to 'just leave him [Rashford] alone.'\n\nEarlier this season, the England star had faced the wrath of his manager Erik ten Hag after he was spotted on a night out in Belfast, before subsequently failing to turn up to training, costing him a place in United's squad for their FA Cup clash against Newport County.\n\nRashford issued a statement reflecting on the incident and his season in the Player's Tribune, saying he was 'not a perfect person' but people needed to stop questioning his commitment to Man United.\n\nAway from football, the star has continued his campaign against child hunger - which he first began on a mass scale in 2020 with his partnership with food waste charity FareShare.\n\nRashford was heckled by a fan at Old Trafford before Man Utd's game against Newcastle United last week\n\nThis saw him raise more than \u00a320million for kids in need, before he successfully lobbied the UK Government to extend free school meals into the summer holidays.\n\nIn 2020, Rashford was handed the City of Manchester Award, as well as the Special Recognition award at the Pride of Britain.\n\nRead More How England's Saudi rebel fell from grace: Jordan Henderson was Gareth Southgate's trusted vice-captain -

given to those who have made an outstanding national contribution to the game, and made an MBE.\n\nBut one of his most prized rewards is likely to be the honorary doctorate he received from the University of Manchester in 2021 for tackling child poverty.\n\nThe Mancunian's other charitable initiatives include The Marcus Rashford Book Club, which has delivered over 100,000 free books across the country, and a partnership with Nike that aims to 'instil self-belief for the next generation of young people' through football.\n\nYet alongside plenty of plaudits, Rashford has sometimes attracted negative headlines.\n\nRashford (pictured on a visit to Larne FC) is alleged to have gone on a 12-hour bender in Belfast hours before a training session\n\nRashford was spotted going into a nightclub late at night (right), and according to waitress Sarah Adair (right) asked if there were any clubs that would stay open beyond 3am if he paid them enough money\n\nAs well as this latest brouhaha in Belfast, Rashford has already been caught out once before this season with his decision to go ahead with a pre-planned 26th birthday party in October shortly after a dismal 3-0 defeat in the Manchester derby.\n\nRead More Infuriated Marcus Rashford confronts a heckling fan at Old Trafford during Man United's warm-up and is pulled away by his team-mates ahead of Newcastle clash\n\nA trip to Manchester nightclub Chinawhite may have seemed innocuous when booked in advance, but hours after the Old Trafford defeat it was deemed 'unacceptable' by Ten Hag.\n\nThe manager was content with his apology and announced that the 'internal matter' had been resolved that week. Rashford was duly benched in United's Carabao Cup tie with Newcastle - and later brought on.\n\nBack in September, after United's 1-0 win away at Burnley, Rashford walked away unscathed after crashing his \u00a3700,000 Rolls Royce outside Man United's Carrington training ground.\n\nThe player collided with the car driven by a 74-year-old grandmother on a rainy September night, and immediately checked she was okay and quickly exchanged insurance details with her.\n\nBoth drivers were merely shaken after the prang, which saw Rashford take out both the other driver and a lamp-post.\n\nAway from football, the star has continued his campaign against child hunger - which he first began on a mass scale in 2020 with his partnership with food waste charity FareShare\n\nThe 26-year-old has published both a run of non-fiction books aimed at empowering children\n\nThe footballer was previously criticised in January 2022 when he and then teammate Jesse Lingard were pictured in Dubai partying alongside controversial rapper Wiley.\n\nThe grime artist was previously been banned from X in July 2020 for a series of widely condemned anti-Semitic posts which called Jewish people 'cowards and snakes'.\n\nWiley had also made a number of comments deemed to be anti-Semitic in a later interview with The Voice which claimed that his Jewish associates in the entertainment industry 'still see us as slaves', and he was later dropped by his management.\n\nBoth Rashford and Lingard were quick to distance themselves from the rapper, with the former sharing a detailed apology to his social media accounts.\n\n'This picture has been brought to my attention which I understand now, given context, could easily be misconstrued,' Rashford wrote.\n\n'I would like to reinforce that I do not and will not condone discriminative language or behaviour of any kind aimed at the Jewish community or any other community.\n\n'I truly believe that tackling antisemitism in and outside of the game requires a greater level of attention and should very much form part of the game's anti-racism stance.'\n\nThe footballer was previously criticised in January 2022 when he and then teammate Jesse Lingard were pictured in Dubai partying alongside controversial rapper Wiley\n\nThe player was keen to apologise swiftly on social media as the image circulated two years ago", "source": {"uri":

He was coming off the back of a 30-goal season which propelled United back into the Champions League and rewarded with a new big-money contract. But the goals dried up at the beginning of this campaign and he found himself frequently shunted out to the wing to accommodate summer signing Rasmus Hojlund through the centre. Rashford's misfortunes were a symptom of United's malaise as they lost eight of their first 15 matches for the first time in more than 60 years to pile the pressure on Ten Hag.\n\nContinued struggles\n\nMarcus Rashford, second right, was red carded in Copenhagen in November (Zac Goodwin/PA)\n\nRashford found the back of the net just once - in a losing cause - in his first 16 matches for United. In this period, he was given a public rebuke from Ten Hag, who labelled a pre-planned birthday celebration hours after an abject 3-0 defeat by crosstown rivals Manchester City as \"unacceptable\". Just a few days later, Rashford was given his second red card in 374 appearances for United in a 4-3 Champions League loss at Copenhagen. In the same month, he scored from the spot in a 3-0 win at Everton.\n\nFrozen out and disciplined\n\nRashford scored just eight goals in the 2023-24 season (Zac Goodwin/PA)\n\nRashford spent much of December warming the bench as his poor returns led to him losing his starting spot. Either side of the new year was a brief upturn in fortunes on the field with three goals in four appearances but he was back in the spotlight after reportedly spending a night in a Belfast nightclub, which led to an internal disciplinary. He was left out of United's win against Newport a couple of days later and was linked with a January switch to Paris St Germain which ultimately never materialised.\n\nRashford hits back but then blows cold again\n\nAmid criticism from the likes of former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, Rashford asked to be shown a \"bit more humanity\" in an article for the Players' Tribune as he rejected claims of a lack of commitment to United. He subsequently went on a three-game scoring run, including an extra-time strike in United's 4-3 FA Cup win over Liverpool in mid-March but it proved a false dawn. After being booed by some fans in the semi-final against Coventry, he did not make another start and his disappointing season yielded just eight goals and five assists in a total of 42 appearances in all competitions.\n\nOverlooked by Southgate\n\nFollowing England's defeat by France in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final, England boss Gareth Southgate faced scrutiny about his decision to not introduce Rashford until the final five minutes, when his side were already trailing. Southgate has stood by the misfiring Rashford in recent squads but he was a peripheral figure in the most recent international break in March and the form of Phil Foden and emergence of Anthony Gordon has left the 26-year-old United frontman out in the cold.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/21/16/wire-85157395-1716304874-957_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He was coming off the back of a 30-goal season which propelled United back into the Champions League and rewarded with a new big-money contract. But the goals dried up at the beginning of this campaign and he found himself frequently shunted out to the wing to accommodate summer signing Rasmus Hojlund through the centre. Rashford's misfortunes were a symptom of United's malaise as they lost eight of their first 15 matches for the first time in more than 60 years to pile the pressure on Ten Hag.\n\nAmid criticism from the likes of former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, Rashford asked to be shown a \"bit more humanity\" in an article for the Players' Tribune as he rejected claims of a lack of commitment to United. He subsequently went on a three-game scoring run, including an extra-time strike in United's 4-3 FA Cup win over Liverpool in mid-March but it proved a false dawn. After being booed by some fans in the semi-final against Coventry, he did not make another start and his disappointing season yielded just eight goals and five assists in a total of 42 appearances in all competitions.\n\nFollowing England's defeat by France in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final, England boss Gareth Southgate faced scrutiny about his decision to not introduce Rashford until the final five minutes, when his side were already trailing.

He only got 15 minutes when England played warm-up matches against Brazil and Belgium in March. He left that camp with a clear warning from manager Gareth Southgate that he had \"a battle on his hands\" to make the squad for Euro 2024.\n\nIt was a battle Rashford just didn't seem ready for. In confirming the Manchester United forward's absence from the 33-man squad for the pre-tournament training camp (to be cut to 26 before they depart for Germany next month), Southgate spoke of having had to make \"difficult calls\" -- by which he appeared to mean an awkward telephone call to the player, rather than an agonising decision that preceded it.\n\n\"With Marcus, I just feel that other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons,\" Southgate said.\n\nRashford cannot dispute that. Southgate had Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Jack Grealish among his alternatives in wide attacking positions. This season has brought the emergence of Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon, while Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney have emerged as the preferred back-up options to Harry Kane at centre-forward.\n\nBy contrast, Rashford has scored eight goals in 42 matches in all competitions for United -- down from a career-best 30 goals in 56 appearances last term. Like Jordan Henderson, he has paid the price for a wretched campaign.\n\nSouthgate says it's \"as simple as that\". And in many ways, it looks like that. But is it really just a case of a footballer losing form, a disappointing setback in a career that still has so much promise? The more you examine Rashford's situation, the more complicated it starts to appear.\n\nWhen Rashford, 26, signed a new contract at United last July, taking his basic wage this season to around \u00a3325,000 a week, John Murtough, the club's football director at the time, declared that \"working with Erik ten Hag and his coaches is the perfect environment for Marcus to continue to develop into one of the best attacking players in the world.\"\n\nIt hasn't looked 'perfect' this season. It often hasn't in the eight years since his breakthrough as a teenager under Louis van Gaal.\n\nThere have been periods -- under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020 and Ten Hag last season -- when Rashford has looked such a natural talent, so at ease with his skillset, his role and status. There have been long periods when his form has gone awry and he has looked like a young man struggling under the intense spotlight and the weight of the burdens he has to carry on and off the pitch.\n\nIt is eight years since he broke into United's first team as a teenager with a flurry of goals (eight in his first 18 appearances). He has scored 131 goals in 401 appearances in all competitions. It is a solid return rather than spectacular, but it has been streaky, as his totals for the past five seasons illustrate: 22, 21, 5, 30, 8.\n\nThis was the fifth season out of nine that he failed to reach double figures for Premier League goals -- and his four double-figure tallies include a 10 and an 11 as well as two more impressive 17s.\n\nLast season saw a period when he was performing his expected-goals (xG) by a remarkable margin, covered by the blue shaded area in the graph below. This season has seen him regress towards his mean performance -- and at times well beyond it.\n\nIt depends whether he is hot or cold. He is a fast, skilful player who dribbles and finishes well when he is on song, but he can look predictable. He lacks the creative instincts of Foden, Saka or Palmer and has never developed into the centre-forward he initially hoped to be. He has already made 461 senior appearances for club and country.\n\nFrom the start, this season has been a struggle. Some fans accused him of settling into a comfort zone after signing his contract, but it has been one of those modern-day United campaigns where nothing and nobody looks right.\n\nBy the halfway stage, Rashford had two Premier League goals. He was performing miserably and attracting a lot of criticism.\n\nHe was publicly censured by Ten Hag in November for attending a nightclub after the derby defeat by Manchester City and was dropped to the bench for four consecutive games in December, but seemed to have had a mini-resurgence by the time he flew to Belfast to see a friend on a day off in late January.\n\nThat trip ended with Rashford reporting himself too ill to attend training at United, having been out in Belfast the night before. When he was absent from the squad for the FA Cup tie away to Newport County two days later, United initially claimed it was due to illness. The club later said, \"This has been dealt with as an internal matter, which is now closed.\"\n\nClosed...but not forgotten. It left Ten Hag feeling let down. The manager has been frustrated by the player's lack of conviction and consistency with the ball -- including in areas where he was excelling last season -- and by a perceived lack of defensive discipline without it.\n\nTen Hag places importance on how his attacking players perform out of possession, as the first line of defence. Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Amad can all be inconsistent in that respect, but Ten Hag has expressed satisfaction at their efforts to adapt to his demands. Rashford's absence from the starting line-up in recent weeks reflects concern about his off-the-ball work as much as his goal return.\n\nAfter the Belfast episode, former United defender Rio Ferdinand suggested Rashford looked unhappy in a wider sense. \"I've not seen Marcus showing that he loves what he's doing for a while now and that would be concern,\" Ferdinand told TNT Sports in January. \"Body language is so important -- and for a long time, his body language has been someone who seems stressed or not happy with where he's at. As a club that's the question I would want to ask him.\"\n\nThe criticism that followed the Belfast incident prompted Rashford to release a 2,200-word first-person article on the Players' Tribune website entitled \"Who I really am\".\n\n\"They're not really writing about me,\" he said of the media coverage of that episode and others. \"It's like they're writing about this character, 'Marcus Rashford'.\"\n\nHe described a media fixation with his salary, his car, his jewellery, his tattoos and his body language, \"questioning my morals and speculating about my family and my football future\".\n\n\"There's tone to it that you don't get with all footballers,\" he said. \"Let's just leave it at that.\"\n\nHe is not the first BME player to imply a different \"tone\" to the coverage of his lifestyle. Chelsea forward Raheem Sterling has shared similar observations.\n\nBut what is clear is that the young man at the heart of this story -- that's Marcus Rashford, not \"this character, Marcus Rashford\" -- has had a challenging time off the pitch as well as on it.\n\nHis mother Melanie Maynard, writing an article in The Times, referred to Rashford being hit hard by the death of a cousin and a friend in the past 18 months.\n\nShe made oblique reference to the \"need to be wary of people's intentions around you\" when you are a high-profile footballer. \"Sometimes people around you can be wolves dressed in sheep's clothing,\" she said.\n\nRashford has said he finds it hard to trust people. He has kept a relatively small team of people around him. As well as his mother and a couple of childhood friends, that includes his older brothers Dwaine Maynard and Dane Rashford, who are listed at Companies House in control of his management team D N May Sports Management. It includes PR adviser Caroline McAteer, whom he hired this season in an attempt to change the media and public narrative around him.\n\nFor three years Rashford engaged the services of PR adviser Kelly Hogarth, who worked with him on his much-praised campaign to end child food poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe and his advisers then switched to Huxley, a boutique PR company, in the hope of pushing his brand onto the front pages of glossy magazines.\n\nIn December last year, faced with a growing weight of criticism over his performances at United, the priority changed again. This time Rashford engaged McAteer, best known within sport for helping to transform David Beckham's public and media image in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThere are interviews when Rashford suggests he finds it easy to block out all the noise. But in that Players' Tribune article he spoke of how \"whenever I've been in my darkest places, and it feels like half the world is against me, I tend to go off by myself for a couple of days and reset -- and then I'm fine.\n\n\"That's just me being an introvert, needing my space to reset. Other times, when that hasn't worked, I've found someone to talk to. Sometimes that's the way to do it. But every single time I've been down, physically or mentally, I always feel like that's when I turn it around and play my best football for United and England.\"\n\nFor a time, the England set-up seemed to have become Rashford's sanctuary. In contrast to many United players of the past, he appeared to perform better for country than club. During difficult times at United, he kept his England place and became a poster-boy for the cultural reset that has taken place under Southgate.\n\nBut that changed. Rashford was frustrated he didn't start a single game at the last Euros, in the summer of 2021, and was deeply upset by the racist abuse he, Jadon Sancho and Saka suffered after missing in the penalty shoot-out in the final against Italy.\n\nA combination of poor form and injuries meant he didn't play for England for 16 months until an upturn in performances at United earned him a recall just in time for the 2022 World Cup, where he scored against Iran (as a substitute) and twice against Wales but was left out of the starting line-up against Senegal and France in the knock-out stage.\n\nOf the 31 matches England have played since the delayed Euro 2020 finals, Rashford has appeared in 14 (five starts, nine as a substitute). As at United, any hopes of nailing down a regular starting place at centre-forward seemed to have fallen by the wayside.\n\n\"He wants to play for England, he loves playing for England and the opportunity to play in tournaments is why you play international football,\" Southgate said. \"I said to him, 'You've got to go and score a couple of goals at the weekend now (against Manchester City in the FA Cup final) and put things right.'\n\n\"You are conscious of whether this is a fair call -- and whether it is the right call for the group. And you are conscious of the impact on Marcus and Hendo because they are two people who, externally, have people jump on them very quickly.\n\n\"They know I am there to support them. Even though this has been a difficult conversation, both were really professional and respectful. I am aware that that creates a bit more drama in their lives which I don't want them to experience but it is a reality of the decision I've made.\"\n\nRashford has endured a fair bit of drama in his life. Nothing too wild -- not Paul Gascoigne levels -- but enough, at times, to add to the burden he carries as a high-profile and extremely high-paid footballer for Manchester United.\n\nLately a sense of intrigue has grown around his professional future. Less than a year into his new deal, United appear open -- or at least not closed -- to the idea of selling Rashford in the event that he and they receive a suitable offer.\n\nThere was an incident last week where he appeared affronted by something a supporter shouted about his future while he was warming up before the match against Newcastle at Old Trafford. Christian Eriksen led him away as Rashford continued to glare at his detractor.\n\nLike most of United's senior players, Rashford was recently invited to a private one-to-one meeting with Sir Dave Brailsford, head of sport at INEOS, whose owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has bought a 25 per cent stake in the club.\n\nBrailsford's intention was to explain the INEOS vision and to get a clearer understanding of the landscape before what is expected to be a summer of change at Old Trafford.\n\nIt is known that Rashford's relationship with Ten Hag has become more strained but it is unclear what feedback he or any other player gave, whether about his own form, the manager, or anything else.\n\nSo much at United is unclear. That includes Ten Hag's future as well as Rashford's. The cup final offers an opportunity to end a miserable season on a high, but Rashford seems unlikely to start.\n\nIn that Players' Tribune article, Rashford signed off by suggesting he thrives on being questioned and criticised: \"If you back me, good. If you doubt me, even better.\"\n\nBut it is one of those sentiments that often sounds hollow; he has appeared bruised and worn down by negative coverage, in the mainstream media and social media. Like most players, he looks more like he longs for warmth and appreciation rather than negativity.\n\nFor now, though, he finds himself out in the cold -- on the margins at United, out of favour with England.\n\nIt must be a lonely place, but Marcus Rashford will hope an unwanted summer off gives him the time and space in which to perform a reset to get his career back on track.", "source":

Petit believes Rashford is \"miserable\" at Old Trafford after a torrid season where he has been criticised for his on-pitch form and behaviour off it.\n\nHaving arguably been United's best player throughout the 2022/23 campaign, Rashford's season-long slump has sparked speculation about his future with the transfer window looming. Aged 26 with his best years still ahead, Petit sees Arsenal as an ideal place for Rashford - who has been left out Gareth Southgate's provisional England squad for Euro 2024 - to fulfil his potential, reports Football London.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United transfer news live shock Marcus Rashford decision 'made' plus Kieran McKenna latest\n\nREAD MORE: I coached Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho aged 17 - more Man United debuts will follow\n\nPetit drew parallels between Rashford's situation and Kai Havertz's tough three-year spell at Chelsea. Having seemed a shadow of himself at Stamford Bridge, Havertz won over fans at the Emirates Stadium this season by netting 13 goals in the league.\n\nSpeaking to BoyleSports, who offer the latest Euro 2024 betting odds, Petit said: \"I know Kai Havertz has improved massively at Arsenal, but it's difficult to say whether Arteta could do the same with Rashford if he moved to the club.\n\n\"However, I have no doubt that Rashford needs a new start and I think Arsenal could be perfect for him. We all know the quality of Rashford for what he's done in years at Man United, but everyone questioned Havertz and his position when he moved from Chelsea. Would Rashford be good at Arsenal? Give me the paper, and let me sign it for him right now!\n\n\"Rashford in a good environment would be incredible for the Gunners as they all look miserable at United. I saw what happened with the fan and I understand his frustration, so if Rashford wants to leave, he's more than welcome at Arsenal and the door is open for him.\"\n\nHe added: \"Havertz was in a strange environment at Chelsea and he wasn't happy, but he has smiled at Arsenal and I can finally see his teeth - I want that for Rashford.\"\n\nA heated exchange between Rashford and a United fan before their win against Newcastle last week summed up the player's mood. Rashford reacted furiously after the supporter in question reportedly moved down several rows and told him: \"If you wanna go, go\".\n\nArsenal are expected to sign a new forward this summer capable of playing in the wide positions, adding pace to their front line and providing competition for Bukayo Saka. However, Rashford primarily operates from the left flank, currently filled by Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\n\nShould Arteta successfully manage to unlock Rashford's potential, the Red Devils academy graduate's skill in beating defenders and finding the net would play a huge role in Arsenal's title pursuit next season. He scored 17 league goals during the 2022/23 season, with a tally of 30 across all competitions.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Martinelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Martinelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/manchester_evening_news_792/4a567cbf05ac412191723d9bce98dae0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

everything you want - they get far more at Man United than any other football club.\n\n\"And I think that is the case when I was a player, and it's still the case.\n\n\"There's been no leadership from the management to him [Rashford].\n\n\"If you think of Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] with Ryan Giggs and the way he dealt with it and he became an absolute world superstar.\n\n\"Who are the senior players going, 'Marcus, this is the way we do it.'\n\n\"He could end his career as one of the great disappointments in the history of the English game, with all the ability he possesses.\"\n\n\"I think he has everything, the only thing you would say he is missing is he's not a clinical finisher.\n\n\"But he's had a couple of good years, he can drop a shoulder and he's got electric pace.\n\n\"He got 30 goals last year and he's got seven [Premier League] goals now, I'm not describing a top player.\"\n\nSouness is also of the opinion that now is the time for United to cash in on Rashford, who is tied down at the Theatre of Dreams until 2028.\n\nHe stated: \"He's from Manchester, it's his team, but for his improvement, I think he should leave.\"\n\nParis Saint-Germain have held previous interest in the player, but talkSPORT understands that is no longer the case.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_lambourne@talksport.com", "name": "Jake Lambourne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Souness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graeme Souness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scotsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Scotsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Giggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Giggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/DK-TALKSPORT-RASHFORD.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1500&h=1000&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

He was coming off the back of a 30-goal season which propelled United back into the Champions League and rewarded with a new big-money contract. But the goals dried up at the beginning of this campaign and he found himself frequently shunted out to the wing to accommodate summer signing Rasmus Hojlund through the centre. Rashford's misfortunes were a symptom of United's malaise as they lost eight of their first 15 matches for the first time in more than 60 years to pile the pressure on Ten Hag.\n\nRashford found the back of the net just once - in a losing cause - in his first 16 matches for United. In this period, he was given a public rebuke from Ten Hag, who labelled a pre-planned birthday celebration hours after an abject 3-0 defeat by crosstown rivals Manchester City as \"unacceptable\". Just a few days later, Rashford was given his second red card in 374 appearances for United in a 4-3 Champions League loss at Copenhagen. In the same month, he scored from the spot in a 3-0 win at Everton.\n\nRashford spent much of December warming the bench as his poor returns led to him losing his starting spot. Either side of the new year was a brief upturn in fortunes on the field with three goals in four appearances but he was back in the spotlight after reportedly spending a night in a Belfast nightclub, which led to an internal disciplinary. He was left out of United's win against Newport a couple of days later and was linked with a January switch to Paris St Germain which ultimately never materialised.\n\nAmid criticism from the likes of former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, Rashford asked to be shown a \"bit more humanity\" in an article for the Players' Tribune as he rejected claims of a lack of commitment to United. He subsequently went on a three-game scoring run, including an extra-time strike in United's 4-3 FA Cup win over Liverpool in mid-March but it proved a false dawn. After being booed by some fans in the semi-final against Coventry, he did not make another start and his disappointing season yielded just eight goals and five assists in a total of 42 appearances in all competitions.\n\nFollowing England's defeat by France in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final, England boss Gareth Southgate faced scrutiny about his decision to not introduce Rashford until the final five minutes, when his side were already trailing. Southgate has stood by the misfiring Rashford in recent squads but he was a peripheral figure in the most recent international break in March and the form of Phil Foden and emergence of Anthony Gordon has left the 26-year-old United frontman out in the cold.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/l3hs43lmnLE_i7PCW9zm5pmv0pk=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/H7AC72DZABA6BP2PIKB5HVB7TY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

You are talking about players that are very important players.\n\n\"With Marcus, in that area of the pitch, I feel that other players have had better seasons, it's as simple as that.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\n\"Hendo has given himself every chance. From the last camp, he missed five weeks through injury and he hasn't been able to get to that tempo since then.\n\n\"It's a big call to make, the three players from last time, he, Ben (White) and Marcus (Rashford) all had excellent professionalism.\n\n\"Jordan will be a miss. He's an exceptional individual and a fantastic human being. He's been in that leadership role for a long time.\"\n\nRashford took to his Instagram story 20 minutes after the 2pm announcement to give a classy response.\n\nHe shared the Three Lions' squad announcement post and wrote: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\"\n\nMeanwhile, five uncapped stars made the initial cut.\n\nJames Trafford, Jarrad Branthwaite, Jarell Quansah, Curtis Jones and Adam Wharton were all included.\n\nThe training squad will be available for England's two warm-up friendlies.\n\nEngland take on Bosnia & Herzegovina at St James' Park on June 3.\n\nThey then host Iceland at Wembley four days later.\n\nSouthgate has to submit his final 26-man squad to Uefa by June 7, just nine days before the Three Lions' opening Group C game against Serbia before playing Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nAnd the gaffer is confident the players at his disposal can go all the way at Euro 2024.\n\nSouthgate added: \"Of course, everyone is waiting for that headline, I'm not going to be an idiot and say no.\n\n\"This team have been close already, they know it is is possible.\n\n\"You can see in cup football, you have to navigate game by game, get through the group and then in knockout football, you see Manchester City only got to where they got to because it is fine margins. You get judged on those moments.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_jones@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Jones", "type":

But the issue for United is that the kind of rebuild that they are believed to be targeting will require some significant funds to be raised in order to facilitate it and remain under the radar of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, in its final year next season before being replaced by a model akin to UEFA's squad cost ratio rule.\n\nPlayer trading is something that United has been poor at executing for some time, and that has hindered progress. Player trading is now more key than ever for clubs trying to remain compliant with PSR regulations and UEFA's squad cost ratio rule. Between 2017 and 2022, United's overall profit from player sales stood at \u00a392m, a sum far worse than any of their 'big six' rivals, with Chelsea's talent conveyor belt from its Cobham Academy helping them to a \u00a3467m figure. Liverpool (\u00a3263m), Manchester City (\u00a3254m), Arsenal (\u00a3226m), and Tottenham Hotspur (\u00a3137m) all significantly outperformed United.\n\nPlayer trading is key to how a club can operate in the market, and while United has been adept at growing revenues through greater commercial deals and the sums derived from matchdays, the club's lack of a coherent football strategy is borne out through the numbers it has managed to get back in through the door in the transfer market.\n\nThe Rashford issue will be given some serious thought inside Old Trafford, and the decision of Southgate to omit a player who had been until recently seen as one of England's key men, could be impactful in terms of what they may be thinking.\n\nWhen players are sold, the profit that the club can book is whatever is over and above the remaining book value of a player, ie the remaining amortisation costs of the player being bought.\n\nIn the case of academy products such as Rashford, they are seen as pure profit as they hold no book value, meaning that whatever the transfer fee agreed, it can be accounted for in its entirety once the deal has been completed.\n\nSelling on academy products has been one of the main factors in Chelsea being able to remain PSR compliant in the most recent financial year, with a number of Cobham graduates moving on for significant fees, while their replacements have their transfer fees amortised over the length of a contract, with clubs not required to account for the full outlay of the fee in one financial year.\n\nRashford, reported last summer to be on wages in the region of \u00a3350,000 per week, has seen his value fall on the back of a poor season, with analysts at CIES pegging his current value at \u20ac80m (\u00a368.3m), while Transfermarkt has it at \u20ac60m (\u00a351.2m). It is highly likely that United would seek above that, however, in the region of \u00a380m given his previous achievements and proven record.\n\nWhat United will have to weigh up is whether they feel Rashford can return to his previous levels of performance next season. If there are doubts then he makes an obvious candidate for a potential exit.\n\nThe question will be whether or not this summer represents the best time to sell for United. On the one hand, they will have him for an extra year of his contract, which is important for holding market value, compared to, say, next summer, but on the other hand his stock is currently low, and his England omission will do little to prompt would-be suitors to pay over the market value for a player on the back of a season of decline, which has been recognised by his absence from a major international competition.\n\nIt would also depend on what kind of clubs would be in the market for such a player. He is of the right age and pedigree, but it is hard to see United selling to a 'big six' rival, and it is the Premier League where the most willing spending will take place this summer.\n\nIt's also hard to see him heading to the riches of Saudi Arabia, meaning that options such as Paris Saint-Germain, or clubs in the Bundesliga or Serie A may be under consideration.\n\nThe early weeks of the transfer market will see some pieces fall into place, and that could set off a domino effect that leads to United either sticking or twisting. It will also mean that clues will be available as to just how fertile the market is, and who is willing to spend.\n\nUnited need to be more adept at player trading, and part of that involves being ruthless and taking sentiment out of the picture. A call will need to be made on the likelihood of Rashford improving his situation at the club, if not the money they will be able to recoup will only diminish.

His season has also been plagued by several off-the-pitch incidents that have at times needed Erik ten Hag and the club to discipline him.\n\nAccording to Southgate, Rashford's poor form is the reason why he won't be on the plan for the Euros.\n\nThe England manager told reporters, \"I just feel other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons.\"\n\nRashford took to social media to react to the news and wished his fellow countrymen good luck.

RSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 22 May 2024, 12:08 PM Last updated: Wed 22 May 2024, 12:25 PM\n\nBy PA Sport Staff\n\nMarcus Rashford has been left out of England's provisional squad for Euro 2024 following a turbulent season at Manchester United.\n\nHere, we look at what has gone wrong for the forward in recent months.\n\nRewind to last summer and everything was rosier for Rashford, who was enjoying a renaissance under Erik ten Hag. He was coming off the back of a 30-goal season which propelled United back into the Champions League and rewarded with a new big-money contract. But the goals dried up at the beginning of this campaign and he found himself frequently shunted out to the wing to accommodate summer signing Rasmus Hojlund through the centre. Rashford's misfortunes were a symptom of United's malaise as they lost eight of their first 15 matches for the first time in more than 60 years to pile the pressure on Ten Hag.\n\nRashford found the back of the net just once - in a losing cause - in his first 16 matches for United. In this period, he was given a public rebuke from Ten Hag, who labelled a pre-planned birthday celebration hours after an abject 3-0 defeat by crosstown rivals Manchester City as \"unacceptable\". Just a few days later, Rashford was given his second red card in 374 appearances for United in a 4-3 Champions League loss at Copenhagen. In the same month, he scored from the spot in a 3-0 win at Everton.\n\nRashford spent much of December warming the bench as his poor returns led to him losing his starting spot. Either side of the new year was a brief upturn in fortunes on the field with three goals in four appearances but he was back in the spotlight after reportedly spending a night in a Belfast nightclub, which led to an internal disciplinary. He was left out of United's win against Newport a couple of days later and was linked with a January switch to Paris St Germain which ultimately never materialised.\n\nAmid criticism from the likes of former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, Rashford asked to be shown a \"bit more humanity\" in an article for the Players' Tribune as he rejected claims of a lack of commitment to United. He subsequently went on a three-game scoring run, including an extra-time strike in United's 4-3 FA Cup win over Liverpool in mid-March but it proved a false dawn. After being booed by some fans in the semi-final against Coventry, he did not make another start and his disappointing season yielded just eight goals and five assists in a total of 42 appearances in all competitions.\n\nFollowing England's defeat by France in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final, England boss Gareth Southgate faced scrutiny about his decision to not introduce Rashford until the final five minutes, when his side were already trailing. Southgate has stood by the misfiring Rashford in recent squads but he was a peripheral figure in the most recent international break in March and the form of Phil Foden and emergence of Anthony Gordon has left the 26-year-old United frontman out in the cold.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 22 May 2024, 12:08 PM Last updated: Wed 22 May 2024, 12:25 PM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Westmeath Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PA Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=48da2036-0acf-5aad-a7aa-7e94d0c93e8b&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.86761&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Southgate has stood by the misfiring Rashford in recent squads but he was a peripheral figure in the most recent international break in March and the form of Phil Foden and emergence of Anthony Gordon has left the 26-year-old United frontman out in the cold.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDVcXFwvMjIxMjA3MjdcXFwvMi43NDUwMTI0NS1lMTcxNjM3NjExMjg2My5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjA0ODQyNTA1Njg4ZWU4MDJmZTg2ZGE3YTc5OWJiZDY4YWY3NGNkOGYifQ==/what-went-wrong-for-marcus-rashford-to-lead-to-england-euro-squad-omission.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The Manchester Evening News understands that INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe is not totally sold on Ten Hag, although the club is working under the assumption that the Dutchman will be in charge next season.\n\nAnd, as a result, it has been reported that INEOS are admirers of the Three Lions' boss and would be keen to lure him to Old Trafford in the off-season.\n\nShould he take over the reins at Old Trafford, Rashford would be up for quite the battle to keep his place at the club, let alone in the starting XI after the England manager admitted the forward's recent form for club and country hadn't been deserving of a place in the 33-man squad.\n\nFor Rashford, his omission from England's squad - which came at the expense of uncapped tournament players like Cole Palmer, Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney - should set alarm bells ringing as he weighs up how best to navigate one of the most complicated crossroads of his career.\n\n\"I just feel other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons,\" said Southgate at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. \"That's it.\"\n\nFor Southgate, the decision might have been a fairly straightforward one but for Rashford his England omission has opened a whole new can of worms that could have serious repercussions on his future at Old Trafford.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keifer_macdonald@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Keifer MacDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/English_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/English Billiards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29064276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2064210177.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

But with Gareth, he picks people if they are out of form. He picks people even if they aren't in their team. I am really shocked.\n\n\"I know people will sit there and say 'oh, the way he has playing' and he hasn't been good. But tournament football is so, so different to any other tournament.\n\n\"I would have taken him. 100% I would have taken him. I don't know if it's anything to do with up here (mentally). I don't know if Gareth has talked to him and that's the reason. I don't know what's going on in the lad's life. But as a player, he has played in tournaments before. It's so important. Tournament football is like no other tournament. Different to friendlies when you are playing at home to Brazil - you lose pace, you lose and he has scored goals in tournaments. He can play on the wing and he can play up front. He's hot. He is one of them hot players. He can be freezing cold, don't get me wrong. He can be really cold, but when the lad catches fire and he is hot, then he is unplayable. That's what you need to win tournaments.\"\n\nYes, over the years, Southgate has proven to be very loyal towards his players, even if they aren't playing for their clubs and struggling.\n\nA certain Harry Maguire is a prime example of that, in fact, he is probably the best example of the lot.\n\nBut Rashford just doesn't deserve the golden ticket to Euro 2024. When you have players like Anthony Gordon exploding at Newcastle United - he scored 11 goals and supplied 10 assists - then you can't leave him out.\n\nThis is the right call from Southgate and it's great to see him being brave by leaving out such a senior figure when it probably would have been easier to leave him in.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amir_mir@hitc.com", "name": "Amir Mir", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Merson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Merson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153191838-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Southgate\n\nRuthless Southgate picks squad grounded on brutal reality\n\nUncapped quintet Jarrad Branthwaite, Curtis Jones, Jarell Quansah, Adam Wharton and James Trafford have made Southgate's initial selection.\n\nEverton centre-back Branthwaite, 21, was key in his side securing Premier League safety this season, while Liverpool centre-back Quansah, 21, and 23-year-old team-mate Jones, who plays in midfield, helped the Reds finish third in the top flight.\n\nWharton, 20, impressed at Palace following his move from Blackburn Rovers in the winter transfer window and his team-mates Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Dean Henderson have also been included by Southgate.\n\nTrafford, who did not play for Burnley after being dropped in March, received his first England call-up in March after Sam Johnstone dropped out of the squad through injury, but has yet to play for the national team.\n\nOther players to make the cut are West Ham forward Jarrod Bowen, Manchester City winger Jack Grealish and Brentford striker Ivan Toney, along with Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and left-back Luke Shaw.\n\nMainoo, 19, played in friendlies for England against Brazil and Belgium in March and has made 31 appearances for Manchester United this season, scoring four goals.\n\nShaw has not played since February because of a muscle injury.\n\nThe training squad will join up on Wednesday, 29 May prior to friendlies against Bosnia-Herzegovina on 3 June and Iceland on 7 June.\n\nSouthgate's side will then open their Euro 2024 campaign with a Group C game against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on 16 June.\n\nKey omissions - who else misses out?\n\nApart from Rashford and Henderson, other notable absentees include Ben Chilwell, Eric Dier, Reece James, Jadon Sancho, Dominic Solanke, Raheem Sterling and Ben White.\n\nLeft-back Chilwell has not been picked, despite injury concerns over Shaw, while right-back James and winger Sterling - also of Chelsea - are absent.\n\nJames has only played two games since returning from a lengthy injury in May, while Sterling has not played for England since their defeat by France at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nSolanke appeared in all 38 of Bournemouth's Premier League games last season, scoring 19 goals and registering three assists, while White has made himself unavailable for England duty.\n\nWinger Sancho is on loan at Borussia Dortmund from Manchester United and, despite helping the German club to the Champions League final, has not been picked by Southgate.\n\nCentre-back Dier helped Bayern Munich to the semi-finals of the Champions League and, even though he is again playing regular football after leaving Tottenham, has not done enough to make the list.\n\nWhy no Ben White in England squad?\n\nWhen Arsenal defender White wasn't selected for the March fixtures, Southgate said there was a \"reticence from his side\" and he did not know why the player had made himself unavailable.\n\nSouthgate said he had \"no issue\" with the player, but confirmed on Tuesday he had not spoken to him since.\n\nWhite left the Qatar 2022 World Cup squad early for personal reasons, with reports saying he was unhappy and had fallen out with assistant coach Steve Holland.\n\nSouthgate denied those reports in March.\n\nWhite's ability to play right-back and centre-back would have been crucial given the injury issues in defence.\n\nBBC Sport football news reporter Alex Howell:\n\n\"White has only made four appearances for England - none in Qatar - and is a fierce competitor, but the view around him not caring about football or loving the game is incorrect.\n\nIt is true that being a footballer is not his complete identity and he does like to do things not connected to football when he is not at training.\n\nWhat is clear is that White is playing the best football of his career in the meanest defence in the Premier League this season. With Reece James not making the squad and several injury concerns elsewhere in the defence, the depth at full-back and even centre-half is not what it once was for Southgate.\n\nThere was an incident with Steve Holland in a team meeting where a comment was made by the England assistant in front of other squad members. White and Holland did speak afterwards and Southgate made clear in the March press conference when White ruled himself out that there was not an argument or an issue between White and Holland.\"",

It's as simple as that.\"\n\nArguably even more surprising was the omission of Henderson. Southgate has refused to budge from his support for the Ajax midfielder, even when it became clear his short-lived switch to Saudi Arabia was destined to end his international career early.\n\nSouthgate's faith has worn out, however, with the boss pointing to recent fitness concerns for justification of his decision.\n\n\"The 33 isn't quite a fair definition [of England's 33 best players], because we're taking a longer squad with some young players to have a look at as well,\" the boss continued. \"Hendo has given himself every chance.

He could, though, finish the campaign with silverware, with the Red Devils preparing to face Manchester City in this weekend's FA Cup final at Wembley.\n\nExplaining Rashford's omission at his press conference this afternoon, Southgate insisted it was 'simple' - other players had enjoyed 'better seasons' than the 26-year-old.\n\nRashford went on to wish England 'all the best' on his social media pages and Southgate praised the forward's professionalism when further pressed on his decision by BBC Sport's Dan Roan.\n\n'Clearly he's played in a lot of important matches for us and scored a lot of important goals for us,' the England head coach told reporters.\n\n'We've worked with Marcus for a long, long time which makes those calls harder.\n\nAsked how Rashford took the news on the phone, Southgate replied: 'Look, I have to say, both him and Jordan Henderson were both incredibly professional and respectful.\n\n'I think they know, over a long period of time, that we've been very supportive when we've needed to be.\n\n'They're not pleasant calls for the boys to receive so I fully understand that, but they were both very mature.'\n\nMany fans believe Southgate has the finest attack in the world at his disposal heading into the European Championships and the England boss is 'very happy' with the depth he has up front.\n\nBut according to Southgate, there remain question marks in that area of the pitch given certain players picked up 'little injuries' in the back-end of the season.\n\nQuizzed on whether England boast the finest attacking talent at the tournament,he responded: 'I'd have to look at all of the squads and see what they've got. We're clearly very happy with the options we have. At the moment, there are a few questions with players that missed the last game of the season and little injuries.\n\n'We don't quite know where all that sits just yet but we like the depth in that area of the pitch and we think that can be a great asset for us, not only who might start the game but who might come into the game and who might come into the tournament.'\n\nSouthgate rejected the suggestion that England are dealing with a 'crisis' in defence heading into the tournament.\n\n'I think \"crisis\" is about more important things than football,' he said.\n\n'But we've got a lot of complications at the back, we've got players that have either finished the season injured or have had injuries and have just got back playing.\n\n'That's the situation we are in and we've picked the players that we think physically, over the next couple of weeks, can get to where they need to be.\n\n'We'll know more and be able to make better decisions in the next couple of weeks.'", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarell_Quansah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarell Quansah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reece_James_(footballer,_born_1999)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reece James (footballer, born 1999)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/comp-1716314425.png?crop=0px%2C23px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

A player like Rashford, we want to see the exciting young player who broke through on fire, running everywhere and scoring beautiful goals.\n\n'He had a lot of commitment then as well, now he is not the same player. Maybe injuries have been a problem and another club for a fresh start could be the right option and Chelsea would provide this for him.'\n\nTen Hag may have publicly remonstrated his player following his reported 12-hour night out in Belfast, which saw him turn up late to training the day after, but he has otherwise offered support on a number of occasions amid Rashford's tricky run of form.\n\nWhen Rashford commented that he had endured 'months and months' of abuse from supporters last month, the Dutchman was quick to empathise with the player's position.\n\nGallas suggested that it might be playing under manager Erik ten Hag that has brought on an issue with his form\n\nChelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino has helped his young players gel after three over-stuffed transfer windows\n\n'I have a lot of sympathy for Rashy, of course,' Ten Hag said.

Aged just 26 with his best years ahead of him, however, Petit sees Arsenal as the perfect place for Rashford to rediscover his magic.\n\nPetit drew parallels between Rashford's current dilemma and Kai Havertz's dismal three-year stint at Chelsea. Having looked out of sorts at Stamford Bridge, Havertz has since excelled at Arsenal, bagging 13 goals in the league this season.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of BoyleSports, who offer the latest Euro 2024 betting, Petit explained: \"I know Kai Havertz has improved massively at Arsenal, but it's difficult to say whether Arteta could do the same with Rashford if he moved to the club.\n\n\"However, I have no doubt that Rashford needs a new start and I think Arsenal could be perfect for him. We all know the quality of Rashford for what he's done in years at Man United, but everyone questioned Havertz and his position when he moved from Chelsea.\n\n\"Would Rashford be good at Arsenal? Give me the paper, and let me sign it for him right now! Rashford in a good environment would be incredible for the Gunners as they all look miserable at United. I saw what happened with the fan and I understand his frustration, so if Rashford wants to leave, he's more than welcome at Arsenal and the door is open for him.\"\n\nHe added: \"Havertz was in a strange environment at Chelsea and he wasn't happy, but he has smiled at Arsenal and I can finally see his teeth - I want that for Rashford.\"\n\nRashford was at the heart of a fiery spat with a United fan before their victory over Newcastle at Old Trafford last week. The supporter is understood to have moved down several rows to berate him, saying: \"If you wanna go, go\", triggering the player.\n\nArsenal have been linked with a forward who can play out wide in recent months. They are eager to add some electric pace along their front line and cover for Bukayo Saka, though Rashford more often plays off the left, which is occupied by Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\n\nShould Arteta be able to unlock Rashford's incredible potential, the Red Devils academy graduate's ability to beat his man and find the net would undoubtedly aid their pursuit of a title next season. Rashford managed to score a career best of 17 league goals during the 2022/23 season and 30 across all competitions.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Perhaps not for the expected reasons, either.\n\nWhilst the Gunners have been regularly linked with Manchester United's homegrown prodigy, it has never felt particularly likely. Not least because for a decent amount of time even Manchester United were actually performing better than Arsenal and Mikel Arteta.\n\nThe foundations have rarely (maybe never) been more stable than at the Emirates Stadium, but Rashford has had his fair share of Champions League football and opportunities to win trophies amid the chaos. For the last two years the scenario has been completely different.\n\nEven if Erik ten Hag did steady the ship briefly at Old Trafford, leading Rashford and United back into Europe's elite competition for another season as well as reaching the latter stages of the Europa League, getting to the FA Cup final and lifting the Carabao Cup, the tumult has been obvious,\n\nRashford's form across a number of years now has been patchy rather than consistent. He has failed to score 10 league goals in consecutive seasons since 2020, yet when he fires is near unstoppable. It is the allure that has kept him involved with England throughout much of the past eight years since his debut despite low points.\n\nNow, having been left out of Gareth Southgate's enormous 33-man preliminary squad ahead of Euro 2024, he is at a crossroads again. The 26-year-old only signed a new contract with his boyhood club in August but followed it up with his second-lowest goals tally since emerging as a first-team option. He is now an outcast to his own fanbase.\n\nREAD MORE: The three standout Arsenal transfer targets for the summer window emerge amid \u00a355.6m striker aim\n\nREAD MORE: Mikel Arteta on track to overhaul Man City and make Arsenal new unstoppable Premier League force\n\nSupporters have taken umbrage to his attitude on and off the field and things came to a head during Arsenal's 1-0 win against United earlier this month when he was confronted ahead of kick-off for a game he wasn't even starting. His stock is now at its lowest since he became a global star, and there are those at Old Trafford who genuinely want him out.\n\nWhere do Arsenal come into this? Well, the historic links play a part, as does the summer reshuffle in Arteta's squad that is likely to follow a series of sales in order to boost financial standing. But when a player of Rashford's calibre is in this sort of strife, it is only natural to wonder.\n\nHis football isn't doing much selling right now but he wouldn't be the first player to require some love and be granted that under Arteta (stage direction, pan to Kai Havertz and Martin Odegaard). It was only 12 months ago that Rashford had come off the back of scoring 20 times for United during their promising first season under Ten Hag.\n\nAt that stage he would surely have been seen as a valuable addition for Arsenal before they went on to sign Kai Havertz. Rashford would likely have been a popular pick as well at the time. How things change, how fast they shift, and how unrelenting it all is.\n\nAlthough very different players, Havertz and Rashford are versatile in their own ways and bring skills that aren't too common at the top level when apparent in full flow. Just like before, there is reason to suggest that Rashford is only a spurt of confidence away - much like Havertz again - from showing what all the fuss is and has been about.\n\nIf Arsenal were to look at Gabriel Jesus and believe an upgrade is necessary in the coming window then Rashford does make some sense. With Southgate leaving him free for the summer it opens up a clear path towards getting a deal done.\n\nThere is no international distraction and pre-season would roll on through at a good time for all involved. Rashford would be able to arrive without the glaring attention of having played a part in a major tournament for England - though the move would obviously get a lot of coverage and criticism.\n\nRashford isn't in his spot as a player right now but the circumstances around him have never been as presentable.

He did show signs of his immense potential occasionally, leading to eight goals and five assists in all competitions.\n\nStill, that has proven insufficient for him to book a spot in England's provisional squad for Euro 2024.\n\nExplaining his decision, the Three Lions' head coach Gareth Southgate said (via Sky Sports): \"With Marcus, I just feel that other players in that area of the pitch had better seasons. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nRashford's reaction was dignified, as he wrote on his Instagram story: \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament.\"\n\nThere's no denying that Rashford has looked like a shadow of his best self lately, but at the same time, considering his experience, many fans and pundits alike would favour the United superstar over Jarrod Bowen, Anthony Gordon, and Jack Grealish to make the difference on the biggest stage.\n\nThe 26-year-old had previously been part of every England squad for major tournaments under Southgate. In the 2022 World Cup, he scored three goals, including a phenomenal free-kick.\n\nMeanwhile, Southgate has maintained his trust in United duo Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.

It is the first time Southgate has not included the United forward in a major tournament squad.\n\nWhile Rashford's form on the pitch has left much to be desired, his most memorable contribution to the season was not showing up for a United training session in January after being spotted on a night out in Belfast.\n\nHis partying antics saw United manager Erik ten Hag jettison him from an FA Cup match against Newport County. After his omission from the Three Lions' Euro 2024 plans, Merson believes that was the moment Southgate lost faith in him.\n\nMerson said: \"I back a lot of players because you don't know what is going on in their minds, you don't know what is going on behind the scenes. But you can't miss training. You can't.\n\n\"I remember when I was 17 and I went out with my cousin's boyfriend and I didn't get up for work in the morning - and my dad told me off so badly. I was 17 or 18 and he said: 'Do not ever miss training'.\n\n\"I never missed another day's training in my life, even when I went out. I was getting back at 6am and I still went to training out of respect. Not just for me, who had lost all respect, but for my team-mates and my manager.\n\n\"I can't back him on that when you hear he was put back to bed at 3am. The lad has got the biggest talent in the world. Last year, he was unplayable. This year, I think I could do as well as him this season.\n\n\"Football is a short career, and the way the game is changing now - he only has four or five years left before he's 30 tops and you can party as much as you want. Don't ruin it, don't ruin it. I think he's made a mistake - and I know he's made a few - but he can play. With turning up late, Rashford has just got to get his head down.\"\n\nA report from the Sun claimed Rashford was seen drinking tequila shots and cocktails in a Belfast nightclub. A waitress also claimed she had to put Rashford in bed after his session ended.\n\nDo you think Marcus Rashford should have been selected by Gareth Southgate? Have your say in the comments section below\n\nDespite the night out in Northern Ireland, Rashford was still selected for the Three Lions' friendly matches against Brazil and Belgium in March. Nevertheless, Merson urged the striker to never take his eye off the ball again, as a career in the beautiful game is not a long one. \"It's a short career and it soon goes,\" Merson commented.\n\n\"Gareth Southgate is a disciplinarian. I know him, he was my captain at Villa and he doesn't like that - the not turning up. You've got England, who I think will win the Euros this summer, so you've got to be there. You can make history. Gareth knows the players, he ain't one of those managers who talks to you only when you turn up to England training.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But circumstances change,\" Southgate said after dropping a few bombshells - and a couple of those perceived favourites - in announcing his provisional 33-strong squad for the European Championship.\n\n\"Look we've had to evolve,\" Southgate said. \"Wayne and Joe Hart were brilliant in how they accepted it at the time. We had to clear space for other people to come through. The job is about making difficult decisions at certain times. You can't shy away from that. I don't think I ever have. They're hard conversations but you do them as respectfully as you can.\n\n\"But that's why we have younger players now with a lot of experience and we have to continue...so, yes, you're looking 'when are the right moments?' 'is this a fair decision?' 'is what we're losing more detrimental than the positive of what we're bringing in?'\"\n\nStill for neither Rashford nor Henderson to make the enlarged list, which will be reduced to 26 on June 7 before England fly to Germany three days later, is surprising and there was then a telling line from Southgate as he explained his selection: \"That gives a different dynamic to training and competition for places. It doesn't allow complacency within the group.\"\n\nComplacency? It was an interesting word for Southgate to use in the context of a squad widely regarded as one of the favourites for the tournament but which is, in fact, suffering from something of a crisis with injuries hitting hard and key players struggling.\n\nStill it would have been the 'safe' option - something Southgate has wrongly been accused of taking in the past - to nevertheless select Rashford and Henderson especially as he was calling up a bigger squad.\n\nSurely it bodes well, therefore, that he has taken such a clear-eyed approach - he bridled when he was asked whether he had been \"brutal\" - with a swathe of players chosen because they have been England's best for their clubs during this campaign. So many England managers, Southgate included, have previously been accused of not selecting on form with the squad being too settled. So, it was not either Anthony Gordon, Jarrod Bowen or Cole Palmer for this squad but all three - now not at least but maybe also for Germany - at Rashford's expense. Given their drop in form, it is an approach that must have Jack Grealish and James Maddison sweating.\n\n\"We think we can see who the best players have been across the season and we are going to need players to come into the game as well at a really high level that can be hugely important for us,\" Southgate said. \"We have always tried to find room for emerging players.\"\n\nInterestingly Julian Nagelsmann, the German coach, has taken a similar approach in naming his preliminary squad of 27. Out have gone stalwarts such as Leon Goretzka, Serge Gnabry and Mats Hummels and in have come players from the in-form teams - Bayer Leverkusen (with three), the unbeaten champions, and runners-up Stuttgart (with five).\n\nFor England, Southgate's selection has to be refreshing even if it throws up an unexpected problem because, despite what the manager argues, suddenly there could be a potentially inexperienced squad that has the look of the future when it needs to be about the here and now.\n\nFor example, in the 33 there are only 15 survivors from the 26 who went to the last World Cup and that was just 18 months ago. And only 16 of the 33 have more than 10 caps while Harry Maguire is the third highest goal-scorer with seven. The absence of Rashford and Sterling alone means two players are not going with experience of nine major tournaments between them.\n\n\"Yes, you would like players playing regularly, fully fit, with a load of caps and experience of winning but it doesn't dictate everything,\" Southgate argued. \"We've got to pick the players that we think at the moment are the best ones to take the team forward. We believe that the Gordons and the Bowens have had brilliant seasons. We liked the hunger that they came in with in March.\"\n\nThe reality is that Adam Wharton, James Trafford, Jarrad Branthwaite, Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones - all uncapped - they probably will not make the cut. Not this time. But they have a chance and not least because Southgate is spending a large amount of the build-up working through medical updates on players he wants to select.\n\n\"Our view is that some of these boys will be England internationals in the future, some might not be but they'll all benefit from the experience,\" Southgate said. \"And they're all in because they've had good seasons, they're playing well and they're contenders to be in the squad.\"\n\nThe danger with that - and something Southgate absolutely must avoid - is suggesting this will be a squad for the future, a squad with potential, even if that is what it is starting to look a little like. At least until it is reduced to 26. Then we will have a clearer idea.\n\nGiven the strength England possesses, and despite the problems, it must ultimately be about the Euros and the immediate task in hand. But Southgate has not stood on ceremony. He has not played safe. And that bodes well.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maddison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Maddison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarell_Quansah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarell Quansah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Gnabry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serge Gnabry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Goretzka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Goretzka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Hummels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mats Hummels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trafford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trafford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/39zm_NYPjrU.8fdTyV.38g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/4f0e1cb0f19f17b3d2fcd7b1df7b68a3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1464, "textEnd": 1470}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It's all about where they end up.\n\n\"We don't pin players to a touchline, that's not how we work.\"\n\nWhile England boast a formidable attacking threat, there are concerns about their defence which is perhaps why Southgate is prepared to look at new candidates before he has to make his final call for the tournament.\n\nSouthgate has remained loyal to Manchester United's Harry Maguire while his teammate Shaw remains a \"long shot\" because of a muscle injury that has sidelined him since February.\n\n\"(Shaw) is up against it but the fact that he has been our first choice (left-back) means we are giving a bit longer than we might have done,\" Southgate said.\n\nThe inclusion of Quansah, Branthwaite and Marc Guehi gives Southgate defensive options.\n\n\"If we picked tomorrow we might end up taking 12 defenders as we have so many questions,\" the manager added. \"But we would rather not do that. In a couple of weeks, things will be far clearer.\"\n\nWharton, 20, has been rewarded for an impressive season with Crystal Palace while Jack Grealish, despite conceding that he has been below his best for champions Manchester City this season, is still in the frame for a role in Germany.\n\nEngland play two friendly matches -- against Bosnia & Herzegovina on June 3 at St. James' Park and Iceland on June 7 at Wembley -- before heading to the Euros, where they are in a group with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nSquad:\n\nGoalkeepers: Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale,

From a rational point of view there shouldn't be much to say about Gareth Southgate's decision not to include Marcus Rashford or Jordan Henderson in his plans for Euro 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, well, this is England, old bean. And being rational has never really had much to do with it. More than ever in the age of tribal celebrity and online Southgate-truthers, every call and every cut must be unpacked for its wider significance, even when this adds up to little more than rationalising two entirely sensible decisions.\n\nOf the two Henderson's absence is more significant on purely sporting merits. It seems likely this means the end of his 14-year six-tournament England career, and as such Henderson deserves some kind of valediction, a party bag, a farewell salute.\n\nRashford has every chance of coming again, ideally after a season when he scores more than seven league goals. But he is also a one-man industry, a cultural object, a daily online rage magnet. For these reasons, plus the simple fact of having been picked a lot in the past, he will be portrayed as the more significant omission.\n\nOtherwise, for anyone who just wants Southgate to make the right calls at this late stage, the main feeling will be one of relief. Picking either player would have been an error from a football perspective. As far as outside noise goes, it would have been a disaster, fuel to every hostile critic and a source of crowing validation for the sceptical periphery, even if those critics are essentially critiquing what they wish to see, as opposed to the cold reality.\n\nHenderson first then. This is a signifiant cut, if only because of things that now lie in the past. Henderson won 53 of his 81 caps under Southgate. He has been vice-captain, played in a final and a semi, and has been a key part of the Gareth-era shedding of the old cloak of never-ending fear.\n\nThis has been a fine England career, all the more so as a function of will rather than outrageous technical gifts. Henderson was never really a defensive midfielder, never really an attacker, more an all-round central run-hard man, good at surging in straight lines, a good long passer with his right foot. At times watching him play against the stronger teams was like watching someone doing shuttle sprints at the local rec while a football match goes on nearby. You half-expect to look down and notice he's wearing a bin liner under his shirt and listening to inspirational podcasts.\n\nThis is praise, not criticism. Henderson is an overachiever, a winning personality. But he has also been there for every big defeat, bypassed even at his peak by better midfielders, from Luka Modric to Frenkie de Jong. This year he has played 12 games for Ajax, three of which Ajax won. The decision to take the money from/embark on a heroic moral redemption of Saudi Arabia [delete according to level of delusion] was reversed. But it was still a badly timed decision. Time for someone else to have a go.\n\nAs for Rashford, again he just doesn't deserve to be in the squad. He has 57 caps under Southgate and has been given a genuine run. But England have real talent in his position. Nine players in this group have scored more goals than him this season. His dropping has already been described as brutal, but he hasn't always been a starter. His England career has instead been composed of moments, lacking in any real shape.\n\nAnd this is the wider thing with Rashford. He has been brutalised to some degree by his own environment. It is Rashford's misfortune to play for two entities, Manchester United and England, whose dominant note is wistful decline combined with unshakeable entitlement, institutions that can never understand why winning isn't just the default option.\n\nRashford is very good but not quite elite. He's very, very good at times, but unable to sustain that in the way real A-listers do. He's not Cristiano Ronaldo. He's a seven out of 10. And that's fine. Except, here it's not. Not when from first appearances he has been styled as a redemptive next big thing, a megastar manqu\u00e9, if only because his club and country demand such things.\n\nAn entire career has been played out against that pressure to fix something, to re-embody the glorious past. Early elevation plus obvious talent fed this hunger. Rashford was treated like a prodigy. The youngest England player at a European Championship. The fewest club appearances ever before making an England debut. His most notable achievements since are to nudge the government into reluctantly helping children and to be exceptionally famous.\n\nAgain this isn't his fault. If he was born Paraguayan Rashford could simply play for Newcastle and be pretty good. Instead he is micro-analysed, pilloried for not being better than he is, and chafed constantly by what is essentially a category mistake. Who knows, a summer of rest may be what he needs. Rashford's career has been played out in this glow, never really allowed to find its own shape. Perhaps he just needs to make a new story for himself.\n\nThe only other thing worth saying about this relates to Southgate himself, and to the question of ruthlessness. Dropping two players with 141 caps between them is no small thing whatever the logic. There is a wider misconception that Southgate is afraid to make tough choices, that he runs a cosy club, is guilty of that most dread sin: \"loyalty\".\n\nThis isn't really right. Southgate got rid of Wayne Rooney straight away, and more recently dispensed with Raheem Sterling. He reshaped the emotional landscape with ruthless efficiency. He ruthlessly stuck by his players. He ruthlessly stood up for his principles.\n\nBeing powerful and bold is not always about rolling up your sleeves, and making a show of just, like, how powerful and bold you are. Southgate may look like the inventor of an inspirational new cordless vacuum cleaner. But he is also the steeliest and most single-minded of England managers.\n\nEither way, England won't win or lose the Euros on of these two calls (they will instead win or lose on how well they manage the absence of a genuinely high-grade second central midfielder). But while loyalty has always been a welcome strength, so too is dispensing with it, as here, at just the right moment.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barney_ronay@theguardian.com", "name": "Barney Ronay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b21cafb6221f45e123d3075b2cae45674348da4/0_96_2590_1554/master/2590.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=42fa1cfede2b4c952aa774dd300a0f41", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Maybe the nuclear option? A future that does not involve Manchester United.\n\nRashford, a player with 60 caps and 401 club appearances to his name, should be at his peak at 26 and one of the first names in Southgate's squad. Instead, he was arguably the easiest to drop.\n\n\"With Marcus I just feel that players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons, it's as simple as that,\" Southgate said. And that was it. Rashford gone in 60 seconds.\n\nThe sight of Rashford engaging in angry exchanges with United supporters during the warm-up before the final home game of the season against Newcastle felt like divorce papers being filed.\n\nThe voice of Josh, a caller to talkSPORT's post-season phone-in on Sunday, seemed representative when he fumed over Rashford's failure to acknowledge the away supporters after the match at Brighton. \"Get him out of my club,\" he said.\n\nThis bitter juncture could never have been foreseen when Rashford broke into the United team eight years ago, a local lad promoted from the academy to heartwarming acclaim as a late replacement for the injured Anthony Martial.\n\nThe goals came quickly against Midtjylland and Arsenal and before the season's end he was an England player. And now look at him, a fallen hero who appears tethered to some awful malaise, unable to break free of whatever it is that has him in its grip.\n\nIt is clear there has to be a reckoning of some kind if he is to reconnect with his old self. And with Southgate putting a red line through his name and United in the midst of a radical overhaul this would appear to be his carpe diem moment. Of all the elements that malfunctioned in United's annus horribilis, none seemed so radically out of step with what had gone before.\n\nIn Erik ten Hag's first season Rashford hit 30 goals in all competitions and was one of the principal reasons for optimism ahead of the second. A Carabao Cup medal and Champions League qualification were seen as a switch triggered in United's long awaited climb back towards the summit they vacated with the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nA year on Rashford is the symbol of something else entirely at United, a decline of such stunning magnitude none beyond the prized few, including Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and skipper Bruno Fernandes, can be certain of their futures.\n\nEven if Ten Hag were to pull off a coup against City, a reprise of Louis van Gaal's ignoble end, sacked with the cup on his lap, cannot be discounted.\n\nParis Saint-Germain was thought to be Rashford's most likely destination were he ever to leave Old Trafford. A year ago it might have been.\n\nHowever, a player who at one time drew comparisons with Kylian Mbappe will have to look elsewhere for a home. Ordinarily it would be too early to consider Saudi Arabia, but on wages of \u00a3330,000 a week, not many outside the kingdom can afford him.\n\nA loan move to a Champions League club might work in the absence of a permanent deal, or a change of manager at United might offer a way for Rashford to continue at Old Trafford if it can be established that his fall is linked to a breakdown in his relationship with Ten Hag.\n\nReports of a fragmented dressing room are consistent with performances that lacked any sense of common purpose or trust. That said, a regime predicated on radical, data-driven reforms is unlikely to be persuaded by romantic attachments to the past.\n\nRashford's response to his England exclusion flashed across social media. Where else? \"Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament,\" it read, both a sad postscript to a season to forget and the signal to address his future with urgency.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_garside@inews.co.uk", "name": "Kevin Garside", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Midtjylland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Midtjylland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_van_Gaal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis van Gaal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_205365824.jpg?crop=161px%2C54px%2C1997px%2C1128px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

He'll be a miss. He's an exceptional individual and fantastic human being.\n\n'The determining factor is the injury he picked up in the last camp. He missed five weeks and he just hasn't been able to get to the intensity [we need] in the games since then.\n\n'You have to make difficult decisions and you have to keep evolving the squad. Your heart, of course, wants you to take all of those players that have been with you for so long.'\n\nEx-Liverpool captain Henderson was not the only high-profile player to miss out, with Manchester

Ben Chilwell, Raheem Sterling, Reece James and Eric Dier were among others to miss the cut, with Southgate's group including five uncapped players.\n\nLiverpool youngsters Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones received a first call-up, as did Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite and James Trafford are also involved having got their first taste of life in the senior set-up in March.

The England boss saying some issues are \"very obvious and apparent\" while others are \"a little bit more nuanced\" and they \"don't have all the information\".\n\nSouthgate expects captain Harry Kane to be fine for the summer despite a back complaint and there is hope Harry Maguire will be available despite a muscle injury. Bukayo Saka and Anthony Gordon missed the final day of their respective club campaigns, while Marc Guehi only returned to Crystal Palace starting line-up on Sunday after knee surgery.\n\nKieran Trippier is building fitness after a lay-off and Luke Shaw has not featured for Manchester United since February. Southgate considers him a \"long shot\", potentially leaving the squad without an out-and-out left-back.\n\n- How much time does Southgate have to assess his options?\n\nThe arrival of Manchester City and Manchester United players will be delayed due to a break after Saturday's FA Cup final, while Jude Bellingham will be given time off after Real Madrid's appearance in the Champions League showpiece the following weekend.\n\nAs for other squad members, they are due to convene in the north-east next Wednesday for the start of their camp. England will train at Middlesbrough's Rockliffe Park - just as they did before Euro 2020 - before playing Bosnia in a friendly at Newcastle's St James' Park on June 3.\n\nSouthgate's squad will then relocate to Tottenham's training ground ahead of the June 7 friendly at Wembley against Iceland.

It makes no sense.\"\n\nAfter what was one of the best season's in Rashford's career in the 2022-23 campaign with 30 goals to his name, the Englishman has had an inconsistent season with problems off the pitch leading to poor form on it.\n\nHe has lost the support of certain sections of the Old Trafford faithful and this exclusion from Southgate's team, after what was a promising World Cup campaign in 2022, will be a blow for the 26-year-old.\n\nRashford signed a new contract at Old Trafford last summer but has struggled to kick on and prove that he can be a consistently brilliant player for the Red Devils.

Southgate considers him a \"long shot\", potentially leaving the squad without an out-and-out left-back.\n\n- How much time does Southgate have to assess his options?\n\nThe arrival of Manchester City and Manchester United players will be delayed due to a break after Saturday's FA Cup final, while Jude Bellingham will be given time off after Real Madrid's appearance in the Champions League showpiece the following weekend.\n\nAs for other squad members, they are due to convene in the north-east next Wednesday for the start of their camp. England will train at Middlesbrough's Rockliffe Park - just as they did before Euro 2020 - before playing Bosnia in a friendly at Newcastle's St James' Park on June 3.\n\nSouthgate's squad will then relocate to Tottenham's training ground ahead of the June 7 friendly at Wembley against Iceland. England's players will have a day off with friends and family, before meeting back up at St George's Park on June 9 and flying to Germany from Birmingham the following day.\n\n- When does Southgate have to name his final selection?\n\nEngland have to submit their final squad to UEFA by the end of June 7 - the day of their send-off friendly against Iceland.\n\nThe squad is not expected to be formally announced until the following day and Southgate has indicated he will select a full complement of 26 players. Squads had been set to return to 23-strong groups at Euro 2024 until recent lobbying by coaches.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

It was a campaign blighted by off-the-pitch issues.\n\nThat led former United captains Roy Keane, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville to all voice their worries about him on the Stick to Football podcast last month, which prompted backlash from Rashford's brother Dwaine.\n\nREAD MORE: Marcus Rashford's Manchester United exit path is now clear on one condition\n\nREAD MORE: Marcus Rashford among 'miserable' bunch at Man Utd - he's 'more than welcome' to join Arsenal\n\nTaking to Instagram, he wrote: \"I completely understand podcasts and how they work but if you have genuine concerns, pick up the phone. We know each other or have crossed paths...\n\n\"Airing so called concerns for the public to have an opinion is bad mind and for clickbait in my eyes. The fun fact is that most of these shows or ex pros have asked for exclusives.\"\n\nSouthgate has clearly taken into account Rashford's lacklustre form, with just eight goals in all competitions for the Red Devils, when considering his attacking options, despite him being an England regular during his tenure.\n\nKeane, Ferdinand and Neville all called for the 26-year-old to make a change in his personal life, believing that to be the root of his problems. The former said: \"I wouldn't say I'm worried about him, but you look at him and there's something amiss.\n\n\"The people around him, whether it be family or his manager, who's on his case every day. Who is giving him an old-fashioned kick up the bum and saying 'Come on, we need more from you'? If you want to be this leader, and you're on the big contracts, then there is that responsibility.\"\n\nFerdinand reckoned he shouldn't be having such issues, like his unsanctioned night out in Belfast in January, at his age. He added: \"He's 26 - what were you [the panel] doing at 26?\n\n\"We were still making mistakes, don't get me wrong, but on the football pitch you had it locked down, you knew what you were doing, you knew what you were about, who you were. There's a big decision to make for him. From him, he's got to look at who is around him.\"\n\nAnd Neville seemed most concerned about the direction he's headed in. \"He's not right, and it's not just a case of him not playing well, he doesn't look happy,\" said the former England right-back. \"I'm looking at him and thinking, 'I am worried about him'.\n\n\"We know there's been a couple of instances this season, he's come under pressure and his form has been bad, but I look at him and think, 'That's not right.' It's not a lad that's grown up with the freedom and spirit of playing for Manchester United as a kid.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_burnham@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Dan Burnham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article28896370.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2112063823.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Fans, however, were quick to screenshot the message.\n\nRead More Revealed: England's squad for Euro 2024 training camp, as ruthless Gareth Southgate AXES Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson - and more stars will follow\n\nThe midfielder is yet to be capped at senior level by Southgate or England, but has played 19 times for the U21 side and was part of the squad that won the U21 Euros last year.\n\nHe has long been pushed for a spot in the senior squad, but he has again missed out and will have to wait until at least next season if he wants to play international football again.\n\nGibbs-White isn't helped by the plethora of options England have in the attacking midfield position, with the likes of Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden nailed for selection, while James Maddison and Eberechi Eze have also been called up.\n\nIn the Premier League this season, Gibbs-White logged five goals and 10 assists, in comparison to Eze's 11 goals and four assists in 10 fewer games.\n\nMaddison, meanwhile, managed four goals and nine assists in 28 matches.\n\nGibbs-White, who has also been capped at U19, U18, U17 and U16 level for England, has been a key player for Forest

described the 'simple' reason why the Manchester United forward wasn't named after revealing his squad, saying: 'With Marcus I just feel that players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons, it's as simple as that.'\n\nRashford then took to social media himself, writing: 'Wishing Gareth and the boys all the best for the up and coming tournament' on Instagram.", "source": {"uri":

And being rational has never really had much to do with it. More than ever in the age of tribal celebrity and online Southgate-truthers, every call and every cut must be unpacked for its wider significance, even when this adds up to little more than rationalising two entirely sensible decisions.\n\nOf the two Henderson's absence is more significant on purely sporting merits. It seems likely this means the end of his 14-year six-tournament England career, and as such Henderson deserves some kind of valediction, a party bag, a farewell salute.\n\nRashford has every chance of coming again, ideally after a season when he scores more than seven league goals. But he is also a one-man industry, a cultural object, a daily online rage magnet. For these reasons, plus the simple fact of having been picked a lot in the past, he will be portrayed as the more significant omission.\n\nOtherwise, for anyone who just wants Southgate to make the right calls at this late stage, the main feeling will be one of relief. Picking either player would have been an error from a football perspective. As far as outside noise goes, it would have been a disaster, fuel to every hostile critic and a source of crowing validation for the sceptical periphery, even if those critics are essentially critiquing what they wish to see, as opposed to the cold reality.\n\nHenderson first then. This is a significant cut, if only because of things that now lie in the past. Henderson won 53 of his 81 caps under Southgate. He has been vice-captain, played in a final and a semi, and has been a key part of the Gareth-era shedding of the old cloak of never-ending fear.\n\nThis has been a fine England career, all the more so as a function of will rather than outrageous technical gifts. Henderson was never really a defensive midfielder, never really an attacker, more an all-round central run-hard man, good at surging in straight lines, a good long passer with his right foot. At times watching him play against the stronger teams was like watching someone doing shuttle sprints at the local rec while a football match goes on nearby. You half-expect to look down and notice he's wearing a bin liner under his shirt and listening to inspirational podcasts.\n\nThis is praise, not criticism. Henderson is an overachiever, a winning personality. But he has also been there for every big defeat, bypassed even at his peak by better midfielders, from Luka Modric to Frenkie de Jong. This year he has played 12 games for Ajax, three of which Ajax won. The decision to take the money from/embark on a heroic moral redemption of Saudi Arabia [delete according to level of delusion] was reversed. But it was still a badly timed decision. Time for someone else to have a go.\n\nAs for Rashford, again he just doesn't deserve to be in the squad. He has 57 caps under Southgate and has been given a genuine run. But England have real talent in his position. Nine players in this group have scored more goals than him this season. His dropping has already been described as brutal, but he hasn't always been a starter. His England career has instead been composed of moments, lacking in any real shape.\n\nAnd this is the wider thing with Rashford. He has been brutalised to some degree by his own environment. It is Rashford's misfortune to play for two entities, Manchester United and England, whose dominant note is wistful decline combined with unshakeable entitlement, institutions that can never understand why winning isn't just the default option.\n\nRashford is very good but not quite elite. He's very, very good at times, but unable to sustain that in the way real A-listers do. He's not Cristiano Ronaldo. He's a seven out of 10. And that's fine. Except, here it's not. Not when from first appearances he has been styled as a redemptive next big thing, a megastar manqu\u00e9, if only because his club and country demand such things.\n\nAn entire career has been played out against that pressure to fix something, to re-embody the glorious past. Early elevation plus obvious talent fed this hunger. Rashford was treated like a prodigy. The youngest England player at a European Championship. The fewest club appearances ever before making an England debut. His most notable achievements since are to nudge the government into reluctantly helping children and to be exceptionally famous.\n\nAgain this isn't his fault. If he was born Paraguayan Rashford could simply play for Newcastle and be pretty good. Instead he is micro-analysed, pilloried for not being better than he is, and chafed constantly by what is essentially a category mistake. Who knows, a summer of rest may be what he needs. Rashford's career has been played out in this glow, never really allowed to find its own shape. Perhaps he just needs to make a new story for himself.\n\nThe only other thing worth saying about this relates to Southgate himself, and to the question of ruthlessness. Dropping two players with 141 caps between them is no small thing whatever the logic. There is a wider misconception that Southgate is afraid to make tough choices, that he runs a cosy club, is guilty of that most dread sin: \"loyalty\".\n\nThis isn't really right. Southgate got rid of Wayne Rooney straight away, and more recently dispensed with Raheem Sterling. He reshaped the emotional landscape with ruthless efficiency. He ruthlessly stuck by his players. He ruthlessly stood up for his principles.\n\nBeing powerful and bold is not always about rolling up your sleeves, and making a show of just, like, how powerful and bold you are. Southgate may look like the inventor of an inspirational new cordless vacuum cleaner. But he is also the steeliest and most single-minded of England managers.\n\nEither way, England won't win or lose the Euros on of these two calls (they will instead win or lose on how well they manage the absence of a genuinely high-grade second central midfielder). But while loyalty has always been a welcome strength, so too is dispensing with it, as here, at just the right moment.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barney_ronay@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Barney Ronay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vacuum cleaner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8251/4125754_2_articlelarge_SOCCER_20England_20_2013185651.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

It is the age commonly accepted as the physical apex for players in those positions, when, even without the nuanced tactical understanding that comes with maturity, they can inflict maximum damage through athleticism alone. It is also the age that Marcus Rashford is now.\n\nAnd, yet, instead of electrifying the European Championship with his prodigious turn of pace, he will be stuck at home in Cheshire, kicking his heels.\n\nWhat a waste. It is easy to forget, for all the lurid headlines around him this past year, how much excitement Rashford can generate when coursing with confidence. At the World Cup in Qatar, his finishing was so lethal, with three goals in 137 minutes of action, that Gareth Southgate sparked an outcry when he did not bring him on until the dying throes of England's quarter-final defeat by France. \"Rashford could have got us on the front foot and changed the game,\" Rio Ferdinand fumed.\n\nFast-forward 18 months, and this potentially thrilling striker no longer even merits inclusion in an extended squad of 33.\n\nThis was not how Rashford's career arc was meant to unfold. After one stunning season, it seemed last summer as if he was set fair for glittering feats with club and country. But the wunderkind narrative has since turned sour, with his experience at Old Trafford so tormented that he spent the warm-up to Manchester United's final home game in a furious row with his own supporters.\n\nIt is tempting here to blame the institution rather than the individual, to claim that the pervasive sense of decay at United leaves no player untainted. But Rashford also needs to shoulder his share of responsibility.\n\nHis off-the-ball indolence is not some matter of subjective interpretation, but a provable fact. The data demonstrates how he made far fewer pressures in the final third last season than in either of his two previous campaigns. He ran far less, too, averaging 19 sprints per game compared to 22 two years earlier.\n\nThe verdict of Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville was, ultimately, difficult to dispute. \"There's something not right,\" he said. \"It's not just the case that he's not playing football well. He doesn't look happy.\"\n\nThis discontent manifested itself in his cri de coeur for The Players' Tribune, where Rashford suggested that his critics had been desperate to bring him down after his hugely influential free school meals campaign during the pandemic. It was an argument that only strained his relationship with United fans who resented his drop-off in effort.\n\nThe problem was not that the paying punters misunderstood him, but that they expected him to justify his \u00a3325,000-a-week salary with something more than a sequence of ineffectual performances or an unsanctioned trip to Belfast that led to him reporting ill for training.\n\nThirty goals one season, eight the next? That is a decline even his most ardent apologists would struggle to justify.\n\nThe stark reality is that Rashford urgently needs a reset. For all his protestations of loyalty to United, the marriage has broken down to the extent that he would be best advised plotting his future elsewhere.\n\nIt is not as if there is a dearth of interest. Paris St-Germain have long made overtures, with Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the French club's president, hatching a plan to sign him after his luminous World Cup displays. Talk of a switch to Chelsea has not relented, while it remains conceivable that Tottenham Hotspur could make a move if they were to jettison Richarlison.\n\nA change of course can hardly arrive a moment too soon. While there are mitigating circumstances for his fall from grace at United, with the arrival of Rasmus Hojlund cutting his chances in front of goal, those following the club home and away have understandably questioned his commitment to the cause.\n\nAt Luton in February, footage of his feeble pressing went viral, showing him neglecting even to try to tackle Ross Barkley. And after the infernal mess of the penalty shoot-out win over Coventry City last month, fans booed him off the pitch.\n\nIt is not a sustainable situation. As Rene Meulensteen, once integral to the United coaching set-up, has said: \"He is a Manchester lad and it would be a shame if he leaves. But maybe a change of coach can help him.\"\n\nWho could quarrel with this? Rashford is crying out to be reinvigorated by some fresh scenery, by a setting where he is not routinely pilloried by fans who feel that they are not seeing an adequate return on his extraordinary salary.\n\nThe pain of being dropped by England ought to serve as the sharpest reality check. Rashford cannot portray himself as the victim of harsh treatment by Southgate, given that nine of the strikers called up scored more goals than him last season. In fairness, he took the news with good grace, wishing the team well in Germany.\n\nBut now he needs to work out how to reset his career's errant trajectory. And it can start with a brutal look in the mirror, an acknowledgement that a 26-year-old in the full bloom of his athletic prowess should not be letting the grandest tournaments pass him by.",

Rashford's absence from the starting line-up in recent weeks reflects concern about his off-the-ball work as much as his goal return.\"\n\nWith a five year, \u00a3300,000 per week deal under his belt, Rashford seems unlikely to move on whether he or United want him to or not. Barring an amazing performance in the FA Cup final, even old suitors like Paris Saint-Germain would be unlikely to cough up the \u00a370 million or so required by United nor match that exorbitant salary after the season Rashford has had.\n\nKay's point about only two in nine seasons having produced a strong output also suggests that a change in manager this summer would be unlikely to have much bearing on how the Wythenshawe man performs next time around. Regardless of whether the relationship with Ten Hag is strained or not, Rashford has been just as inconsistent under other managers as he has under the Dutchman.\n\nGareth Southgate's decision yesterday to leave him out of the provisional England squad for Euro 2024 suggests that he, too, does not feel confident that he can bring the best out of the player. Indeed, it suggests he does not think the problem lies with Ten Hag or United.\n\nOf course, there may be a manager, or coach, or sport psychologist who can consistently bring the best out of Marcus Rashford. But ultimately it seems as if the only person who can find that key will be the player himself.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "red_billy@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Red Billy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wythenshawe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wythenshawe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wythenshawe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Marcus-Rashford3-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

It may be that he already knows who he wants to take to Germany, in which case keeping an extra seven players in full training mode - rather then letting them head off for their summer holidays - is merely precautionary in case of injuries. Yet there would seem to be places to be won in defence and tough decisions over who to leave out in attack, meaning a lot could ride on upcoming friendlies against Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iceland.\n\nDefensive issues\n\nLuke Shaw is England\u00b4s main injury worry (Mike Egerton/PA)\n\nThere are 11 defenders in the initial squad and some of the most experienced - Harry Maguire, John Stones and Luke Shaw - have had injury problems this season. Shaw may not make it at all, a particular concern given the shortage of other left-back options. There is a strong chance Kieran Trippier, primarily a right-back but versatile enough to operate on the left, could be first choice in that position despite his own injury woes. Joe Gomez's versatility could also help his cause. Marc Guehi, Ezri Konsa and Lewis Dunk will eye back-up centre-back roles but Jarrad Branthwaite and Jarell Quansah have everything to gain in those friendlies.\n\nAttacking headaches\n\nJack Grealish is among the players that could be sweating on his place (Tim Goode/PA)\n\nThe problems at the other end of the field are completely the opposite, where Southgate has too many exciting players vying for places. Many international managers might love to have just one of Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Jack Grealish, Anthony Gordon and James Maddison, but the chances are Southgate is going to have to leave some of them out. It is the sort of headache managers say they like to have, but those final decisions will be tough.\n\nBacking up Kane\n\nHarry Kane will lead the line but back-up will be needed (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nHarry Kane is the undisputed leader of the side but centre-forward cover will be required. With other attacking options including Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Cole Palmer, only one extra out-and-out striker might be needed, but that would still leave a difficult choice between Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney. Watkins' outstanding season might give him the edge, but Toney's brilliance from the penalty spot is hard to ignore.\n\nPutting faith in youngsters\n\nMarcus Rashford did not make the squad (John Walton/PA)\n\nSouthgate's decision to leave out Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson has shorn the squad of a lot of experience. Yet with the likes of Kane, Kyle Walker, Stones, Maguire and Trippier around, with Foden and Bellingham having now matured into players of some repute, there is still plenty of it about. This could afford Southgate slack to stick with some of his younger players.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Dunk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maddison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Maddison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walton,_Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walton, Liverpool"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/22/09/wire-85188219-1716364901-836_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 422, "textEnd": 428}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

We know each other or have crossed paths.\n\n\"Airing so called concerns for the public to have an opinion is bad mind and for clickbait in my eyes. The fun fact is that most of these shows or ex pros have asked for exclusives.\"\n\nSouthgate appears to have taken Rashford's subdued performance into account, with the forward netting only eight goals across competitions this season, despite being a staple in the England squad under his management.\n\nKeane, Ferdinand, and Neville all suggested Rashford needs to make a change in his personal life, pinpointing it as the crux of his troubles. Keane remarked: \"I wouldn't say I'm worried about him, but you look at him and there's something amiss.\n\n\"The people around him, whether it be family or his manager, who's on his case every day. Who is giving him an old-fashioned kick up the bum and saying 'Come on, we need more from you'? If you want to be this leader, and you're on the big contracts, then there is that responsibility.\"\n\nFerdinand felt his actions, notably his unsanctioned night out in Belfast, weren't reflective of his age and reckons he should be further along in his career than he is. He added: \"He's 26 - what were you [the panel] doing at 26?\n\n\"We were still making mistakes, don't get me wrong, but on the football pitch you had it locked down, you knew what you were doing, you knew what you were about, who you were. There's a big decision to make for him. From him, he's got to look at who is around him.\"\n\nNeville also didn't mince his words about his current form - the striker has netted just eight times from 42 matches this season. He declared: \"He's not right, and it's not just a case of him not playing well, he doesn't look happy. I'm looking at him and thinking, 'I am worried about him'.\n\n\"We know there's been a couple of instances this season, he's come under pressure and his form has been bad, but I look at him and think, 'That's not right.' It's not a lad that's grown up with the freedom and spirit of playing for Manchester United as a kid.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

and leap up - Harry Maguire!\n\nThe centre-back, 31, has bagged seven goals in 63 internationals, mainly via his dynamic heading ability.\n\nAnd although he's a leader on the pitch, it's the quiet way he knuckled down to the challenge that has impressed most observers.\n\nMaguire has been an England regular pretty much since making his debut in 2017, a year into Southgate's reign.\n\nHe switched from Leicester to the Red Devils for \u00a385million in 2019, a then-world record for a defender.\n\nAnd after a honeymoon period there were a few wobbles at United.\n\nBut for England his consistency has rarely dropped.\n\nAnd he became a fans' favourite at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nPartly that was because he was snapped during downtime riding an inflatable unicorn.\n\nBut mostly it was due to rousing performances capped by a soaring, scoring header in the 2-0 quarter-final win over Sweden.\n\nNonetheless, supporters are intrigued to see an England squad packed with frontline options where Maguire is so high up the goal list.\n\nOne fan posted: \"THE THIRD HIGHEST GOAL SCORER IS HARRY MAGUIRE\" - followed by shocked emojis.\"\n\nAnother posted: \"This squad lacks goalscorers which is why he should've taken Rashford instead of Grealish, I mean you already have Saka and Foden if you want creativity, that decision might bite him.\"\n\nAnd a third responded: \"Yet another reason why you have to take Rashford.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as that selection debate rages on, you can expect Maguire to once again just let his feet - and head - do the talking.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/newspress-collage-qlzrv7ycy-1716304440576.jpg?1716311118&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586332", "eventUri": "eng-9586332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The election will come bang in the middle of the knockout stages, with the hosts kicking the tournament off on 14 June.\n\nThe Three Lions will take on Denmark, Serbia and Slovenia in the group stages, with expectations of easily reaching the Last 16. That stage starts on 29 June and ends eight matches later on 2 July.\n\nThere will then be a two-day break from games before the quarter-final stages begin on 5 July. As a result, England will not be playing on polling day however they fare in the group stage.\n\nSunak has called the election with his Conservative Party sitting roughly 21 points behind Labour in the polls. That puts them on course for a crushing defeat on polling day having won a landslide majority in the 2019 election.\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate announced a 33-man provisional squad for the tournament on Tuesday, with Jordan Henderson and Marcus Rashford surprisingly left out. The squad will be further cut down for a final announcement on 8 June, with Southgate admitting he still has some decisions to make.\n\n\"There were definitely some players we wanted to see. We were in a similar situation before EURO 2020 where buying some time could help us make better decisions and might help us pick a more balanced squad. There are some injury issues that are very obvious and others where we don't have all the information,\" the England boss said.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win Euro 2024? Comment below.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to work with the players and see how they react physically to training. This has been as complicated a group as I can remember picking. I think we can make better decision by giving ourselves more time.\n\n\"We're talking about players who are very good and have been an important part of what we've done over a number of years. With Marcus, I just feel that other players in that area of the pitch have had better seasons. It's as simple as that. With Jordan, the determining factor is the injury he picked up around the last camp.\n\n\"He's missed five weeks and just hasn't been able to get to the intensity since then. He's a fantastic professional and it was a really difficult call to make because he's been so supportive in my time here. All three boys who were with us last time - including Ben Chilwell - were incredibly professional and took the news really well.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

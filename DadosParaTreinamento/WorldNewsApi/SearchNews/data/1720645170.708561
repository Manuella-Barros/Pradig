The question seemed odd, given that Thomas would have been familiar with the issues before the court \u2014 issues that didn\u2019t include the legality of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s appointment. Justices ask questions for a variety of reasons, but some read this one as Thomas\u2019s volunteering a potential argument for the Trump team, which was claiming that the former president had immunity from prosecution in the Jan. 6 case involving efforts to overturn the 2020 election.", "summary": "She\u2019s again entertaining Trump\u2019s arguments in an extraordinary way.

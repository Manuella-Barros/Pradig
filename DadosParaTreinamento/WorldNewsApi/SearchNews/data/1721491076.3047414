In his career of more than two decades, Omar has dropped eight albums. He's been nominated for 13 Latin Grammy Awards, and he's won two. Omar portrayed Rico Santos in several of the Fast and the Furious movies: 2009's Fast & Furious, Fast Five (2011), The Fate of the Furious (2017), and in F9 (2021).

PEOPLE noted that Omar broke the health news two days after he posted an Instagram Reel of dancers auditioning to join his tour. \"The most special thing about today's auditions is seeing that there are people who want to dare to dream with me,\" he wrote Saturday. \"Thank you to each of you who gave your all on the dance floor!

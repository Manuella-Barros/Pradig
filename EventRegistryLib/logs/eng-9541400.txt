These 5 players are destined to carve out a larger role with the team and hopefully be a sight for sore eyes.\n\nSam Williams has just 8.5 sacks in his first two seasons. After being drafted in the second round many fans looked to see an immediate impact but due to Cowboys overabundance of pass-rushers Williams didn't get the chance to make a name for himself. When on the field Williams made his presence felt and with Dante Fowler and Dorance Armstrong gone Williams will see the bulk of their snaps.\n\nI am a big fan of Rico Dowdle, he isn't an every down back but he has proven he can make defenders miss and be a home run hitter when given the ball in space. Dowdle will be splitting snaps with Ezekiel Elliott and will likely have the role Tony Pollard once had when sitting behind Elliott. Zeke will be the bully fighting for yards and Dowdle will be the Cowboys big play threat heading into week 1.\n\nJalent Tolbert showed significant improvement from year 1 to year 2 and Dallas fans are hoping that trend continues following the loss of Michael Gallup. Despite being 4th on the depth chart Tolbert was able to produce a highlight reel of plays and should have no problem matching and even outplaying Gallups 2023 performance.\n\nThe Cowboys were exstatic after drafting DeMarvion Overshown out of Texas. Dallas viewed Overshown to be their next star linebacker. He had an excellent training camp last season even calling plays for the Cowboys defense until he tore his ACL. Overshown looks to be healthy next season and is ready to make his presence felt in the regular season.\n\nMazi Smith had a rough first season considering his draft position. Smith was a first rounder, and many Cowboys fans were not looking to have project player which is exactly what Smith is. However, It is rare to see rookie NT's star in their first season in the NFL which is why fans shouldn't be so quick to give up on last year's first rounder. Smith is certain to improve his numbers next season after the Cowboys lost Johnathan Hankins and Neville Gallimore.\n\nCowboys are looking to get over the hump and at the very least get past the Divisional Round.

The Cowboys' haul earned the latter dubious distinction.\n\n\"Though Prescott and the Cowboys have been at their best when the front line dominates the trenches,\" Brooks writes. \"The questions surrounding Tyler Guyton (a raw prospect) and Cooper Beebe (underwhelming traits) make it hard to comprehend the team's draft strategy, especially considering the other prospects who were on the board. If Guyton and Beebe fail to make a swift transition to the NFL in Year 1, the Cowboys' offense could struggle to move the ball consistently against top opponents.\n\n\"With the team failing to pick up plug-and-play prospects at running back and wideout, the offense will need serious contributions from a retread in the backfield (Ezekiel Elliott) and possibly a sixth-round receiver (Ryan Flournoy). At the moment, this feels like a team that's moving backward, not going all in.\"\n\nFor a franchise at a pivotal juncture led by a head coach and quarterback on lame-duck contracts, and whose only marquee offseason addition was a veteran linebacker, the Cowboys are placing immense pressure on its incoming draft class to make key contributions in key spots immediately.\n\nThe Cowboys' first-round selection of Guyton has drawn mixed reviews, with the Oklahoma tackle considered a raw project by some analysts and NFL evaluators.\n\nHowever, former Minnesota Vikings general manager and current CBS Sports analyst Rick Spielman believes the Cowboys filled one of their most pressing needs by tabbing Guyton at No. 29 overall.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if they move him over to the left side,\" Spielman says. \"I know that he played on the right side at Oklahoma, but, he's more than athletic [enough] to move over to the left side.\n\n\"I do like his aggressiveness and the style that he plays with. This was a huge need that Dallas had to fill. And, I bet that if they put him over at left tackle, he'd be the starter and you can keep [Tyler] Smith at guard, where I think he's better at guard than he is at left tackle.\"\n\nIf Guyton is ready to step in and play at a high level immediately, it would soften much of the blow from the Cowboys being unable to re-sign Tyron Smith in free agency.\n\nLast season in Norman, Guyton didn't allow a sack while surrendering three quarterback hits and nine total hurries, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\"From strictly a tools perspective,\" Senior Bowl Executive Director Jim Nagy recently told Heavy. \"You could make a good case he's the highest ceiling tackle in this draft.\n\n\"Tyler just does things athletically these other guys can't do. He's so light on his feet it just looks like he's floating sometimes. Even though he's played right tackle in college, he's a high-level left tackle athlete.\"\n\nThe Cowboys are bringing back Ezekiel Elliott, and the veteran running back is returning on a team-friendly contract.\n\nAccording to a report from The Star-Telegram, Elliott is set to play on a one-year contract worth $3 million, including $2 million guaranteed.\n\nReturning to the Cowboys after spending one season with the New England Patriots, Elliott rushed for 642 yards with three touchdowns while starting the final three games of the 2023 campaign.\n\n\"This was my priority. Doing what I could to get back here,\" Elliott told Clarence Hill Jr. of The Star-Telegram. \"I have a lot left to accomplish here.

Though Elliott is far from the superstar he was early in his career, he can still be effective in a running back by committee. He's excellent in pass protection, has a nose for the end zone and is an outstanding teammate.\n\nEven better is that Elliott has already revealed he's excited to mentor the Cowboys' young stable of running backs.\n\nThere's really only one way this move can blow up in Dallas' face: If Jerry Jones' vision of Elliott as a starting running back comes to fruition. Even though Elliott's 2023 stats ranked near the bottom of the league, Jones still views Elliott as a RB1.\n\nPerhaps Jones wants to throw teams off the scent of the Cowboys' potential plans to add another rusher. There are a handful of possible trade options in that regard. The going rate for RBs suggests they could be had for a day three pick -- perhaps as little as a six- or seventh-rounder.\n\nIt turns out fans in Dallas need not worry about Jones' vision. Elliott's full contract details are out and they prove the team isn't fully committed to the two-time rushing champ.\n\nEzekiel Elliott contract details with Cowboys walk back Jerry Jones' previous praise\n\nElliott essentially got a veteran minimum contract. It carries a max value of $3 million and includes multiple incentives.\n\nPer ESPN's Cowboys reporter Todd Archer, Elliott has a $1.25 million base salary and $375k signing bonus that are fully guaranteed. The incentives are worth up to $1 million. He can make $250k by totaling 1,100 scrimmage yards and if the Cowboys make the playoffs. He'll earn an extra $250k if he scores 10 touchdowns and Dallas qualifies for the playoffs. $500k is headed Zeke's way if he plays 51% of the snaps and the team makes the playoffs.\n\nThose terms prove the Cowboys aren't fully committed to Elliott, which is the complete opposite of what Jones implied during the draft. It's clear Jones embellished about Elliott to create a stir amongst fans and the media and ensure his Cowboys are a prominent talking point.\n\nIt thankfully seems like the team is keeping its options open at running back. This contract is a best-case scenario. The hope is that Elliott proves during training camp that he still has some juice and can be part of a RB committee. In the slim chance that Zeke isn't one of the top three backs on the roster, Dallas can move out without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe latter scenario would arguably sting worse than his release last March. Luckily for Elliott, his current competition is composed of Rico Dowdle, journeyman Royce Freeman, former undrafted free agent Malik Davis, who has 38 career carries, and Deuce Vaughn, who averaged less than 3.0 yards per carry as a rookie and offers almost nothing in pass protection.\n\nAssuming that Elliott makes the 53-man roster, his contract details all but confirm that Jones was once again posturing to the media. As much as the Cowboys respect Zeke, they aren't fully committed to him as their RB1.", "source": {"uri": "thelandryhat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Landry Hat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerry_trotta@thelandryhat.com", "name": "Jerry Trotta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journeyman (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7267,h_4087,x_0,y_137/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/129/01hwteaybk2hyjz3bd72.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541400", "eventUri": "eng-9541400", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

We'll conclude with a look at the Dallas Cowboys after previously analyzing picks made by the New York Giants and picks made by the Washington Commanders.\n\nThis was a typical Cowboys draft: boring but good. The team added a ton of quality depth to their offensive line with guys with starter upside. Throw in some intriguing pass rushers and skill players on both sides of the ball and it's the same as it ever was.\n\nWhat he can do: Tyler Guyton was one of the more impressive athletes in the 2024 draft class. His unbelievable size is hard to miss and he is a rare athlete to match. He came to Oklahoma as a defensive lineman but switched to the offensive line where he played about 1,000 snaps at right tackle over the last two years. He is inexperienced, which shows in his lack of technical consistency. When he's \"on\" he is extremely dominant as a pass and run blocker.\n\nCowboys Outlook: The Cowboys are great at reloading along the offensive line and Guyton is likely going to take over at right tackle sooner than later. Getting quality snaps under his belt will be crucial. He might have some growing pains in the NFL, but his upside is very high.\n\nWhat he can do: Marshawn Kneeland was extremely disruptive during his time at WMU but didn't regularly convert pressures into sacks or TFLs. He is very, very athletic and plays with a ton of energy. His lack of pass rush moves hurt his ability to produce and he comes off as a little stiff. He bullied non-power five tackles with relative ease, but the quality of competition argument goes both ways. Kneeland didn't have a ton of help on the Broncos defense and its possible his production improves when he is not a clear cut best defender.\n\nCowboys Outlook: The Cowboys have a great stable of pass rushers, allowing them to be patient with Marshawn Kneeland. Kneeland can be a rotational player and learn a thing or two from Micah Parsons and DeMarcus Lawrence.\n\nWhat he can do: Cooper Beebe was one of the more straightforward players in the class. He is not a great athlete, but makes up for athleticism with an extremely high football IQ and technical consistency. He was a picture of dependability for the Wildcats and will bring that reliability to the NFL.\n\nCowboys Outlook: Cooper Beebe can and should start at either guard position as a rookie. He will have a long NFL career.\n\nMost Important Stat: Blitzed on 21.6% of his defensive snaps in 2023 (per Pro Football Focus)\n\nWhat he can do: Marist Liufau is an exciting linebacker whose energy and physicality made him a fun watch on the Irish defense over the last two years. He is fast, aggressive, and has great instincts especially in coverage. He is a good, not great, run defender whose lack of size can make him vulnerable to more physical blockers.\n\nCowboys Outlook: The Cowboys love fast linebackers who can cover a ton of ground at the expense of being high-impact run defenders. Liufau might be best served as a nickel linebacker to start his career and then maybe develop into a three-down defender.\n\nMost Important Stat: Allowed five touchdowns in the last two years while picking off zero passes (per Pro Football Focus)\n\nWhat he can do: Caelen Carson stood out over four years at Wake Forest with his outstanding run defense and physicality. Carson plays like his hair is on fire, excitingly coming downhill to make big tackles on the perimeter. In coverage, he can make receivers' lives hell at the line of scrimmage. That being said, his lack of long speed makes him vulnerable down the field. He can get a bit grabby when he loses snaps too.\n\nCowboys Outlook: Carson projects as a slot defender in the NFL. His plus run defense will be an asset closer to the play and his lack of speed can be insulated a lot more. Carson could see meaningful snaps earlier in his career despite being a late round pick.\n\nWhat he can do: Ryan Flournoy stood out at the FCS level due to his explosive athleticism, big hands (over 10 inches!), and great ball skills. He is unpolished as a route runner and struggles with more physical coverage, but his upside jumps off the screen.\n\nCowboys Outlook: The Cowboys add some much needed competition to their wide receiver room. They have been struggling to find consistent WR play beyond CeeDee Lamb. Flournoy will compete for snaps at the WR3 or WR4 spot on the depth chart and hopefully contribute as a special teams player.\n\nWhat he can do: Nathan Thomas was a late bloomer for the Ragin' Cajuns, struggling in 2021 and 2022 to really find his bearings at left tackle. This year he delivered, developing into a truly dominant run blocker. Thomas is a good athlete but his lack of arm length makes it easy for him to give up pressure on the edge.\n\nCowboys Outlook: Thomas might be best suited as an NFL guard, but has the potential to be a good one. He is a powerful, physical player who does his best work in a phone booth. He'll add competition and youth to the Cowboys line.\n\nWhat he can do: Justin Rogers is a huge guy. Rogers played at over 340 pounds at times and has strong, 11 inch hands. He played as a nose tackle for three years at Kentucky before finishing school at Auburn. He is not much of a pass rusher, but offers some space-eating ability that can help in run defense.\n\nCowboys Outlook: The Cowboys have had a vulnerable run defense for a few years now and need all the help they can get plugging up holes. While Rogers has a very low ceiling, he could contribute as a two-down lineman.", "source": {"uri": "bleedinggreennation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Green Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_natan@bleedinggreennation.com", "name": "Ben Natan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Beebe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Beebe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoVbZVVGJS-bqVk0WX9ElHZcWkU=/0x467:3992x2463/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25434661/1753460976.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541400", "eventUri": "eng-9541400", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

One aspect of the off-season that should garner Cowboys fans attention will be the many position battles taking place in OTA's, training camp, and preaseason games.\n\nBoth Trey Lance and Cooper Rush have one year left on their deals and they could be fighting to have a roster spot this year. Aside from last year the Cowboys generally only carry two QB's on their 53-man roster. If one of these players are the clear cut better option the Cowboys could look to trade the lesser of the two. If the Cowboys decide to keep Lance and Rush the loser of the camp battle will serve as the emergency QB.\n\nRico Dowdle and Ezekiel Elliott have locked in their spot on the roster and it should be a competitive battle in training camp and preseason games to fill out the rest of the RB group. Both Deuce Vaughn and Hunter Luepke earned a spot on the roster last season and will be competing for a spot on the roster with Royce Freeman, Malik Davis, Snoop Conner, and Nathaniel Peat (UDFA).\n\nWith CeeDee Lamb, Brandin Cooks, Jalen Tolbert, and Kavontae Turpin taking up the first 4 spots on the roster it should be a battle for the remaining one or two spots if the Cowboys decide to have 6 wide receivers on the roster. Jalen Brooks was able to make plays with a limited sample size and Ryan Flournoy Cowboys 6th rounder will be competing with Martavis Bryant, Cam Johnson (UDFA), Corey Crooms (UDFA), David Durden, Tyron Johnson, Racey McMath, Jalen Moreno-Cropper, and John Stephens Jr. That's 10 players competing for two roster spots and it should make for an extremely competitive battle in training camp.\n\nThe Cowboys typically only carry three tight ends and they will use the first two spots for Jake Ferguson and Luke Schoonmaker. Peyton Hendershot has proven to be a good receiving threat but struggles in run-blocking. Brevyn Spann-Ford is a more impressive athlete and comes from run-first college at Minnesota.

Most of their needs were addressed, but despite the success over the three days, the team is still missing one big element on offense, speed.\n\nThe Cowboys did a good job of rebuilding the offensive line, which should help improve their attack, but they didn't find any game breakers who can threaten a defense. It's hard to argue with what the team did in the trenches, the first-round selection of Tyler Guyton will help replace former starting left tackle Tyron Smith. It was unlikely the Cowboys were going to select a running back or wide receiver with that pick, so Guyton made sense.\n\nIn the second-round many experts felt Dallas might try to add their running back of the future. Either Texas' Jonathon Brooks or Florida St. RB Trey Benson could have added an element of speed and explosiveness to the offense. However, when the Carolina Panthers grabbed Brooks with the 46th pick, the Cowboys decided to go in another direction, opting not to select Benson and his 4.39 speed.\n\nWide receiver might have been an option in the second round as well. With Texas WR Adonai Mitchell slipping in the draft, the Cowboys might've pulled the trigger on drafting his 4.34 speed with the 56th pick, but he was taken at 52 by the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nRound 3 was surely the right time and place to find some speed. The Cowboys had two selections in the round, but with offensive linemen Cooper Beebe still available and just two RBs off the board at the time, fortifying the center position was a smart decision.\n\nHowever, the golden opportunity came with their second third-round pick at 87. The Cowboys had one of the premiere game breaking RBs available when they came on the clock but chose not to draft Tennessee's Jaylen Wright. With his 4.38 40-yard timed speed and with over 25% of his carries going for over 10 yards in 2023, Wright was the perfect answer to what ails this offense.\n\nDallas had a major need to add speed and explosiveness to an offense that has very little of both and they bypassed it to draft linebacker Marist Liufau.\n\nAfter that selection, the Cowboys didn't have a pick until late in the fifth-round, and in the span of those 85 picks, 13 RBs and 10 WRs were drafted. Among the fastest options selected were Wright, Oregon WR Troy Franklin, Clemson RB Will Shipley, Louisville RB Isaac Guerendo, Arizona WR Jacob Cowing, and Oregon St. WR Anthony Gould, all of whom had a 40 time of under 4.4 seconds. There were also a host of other options who came in under 4.5 seconds in their timed speed who the Cowboys had no chance at picking.\n\nThe team did find some athleticism for a skilled offensive position in the sixth-round with the selection of Ryan Flournoy. Flournoy made Bruce Feldmean's 'Freak List' with his 4.4 speed at the combine at a size over 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds. That was good for top 15 at WR, but Flournoy is somewhat of a project at the position.\n\nDallas bypassed the RB position altogether in the draft and added just one runner as an undrafted free agent, Missouri's Nathaniel Peat, who runs a 4.37 40-yard dash. However, his status and inexperience with just 293 career carries makes him a long shot to make the roster.\n\nAs it stands there isn't much explosiveness to the Cowboys' offense. Former running back Tony Pollard brought that ability, but even he didn't provide much last season, with just eight plays of 20+ yards in 2023. There isn't a RB on the roster right now capable of scaring defenses.\n\nThere's speed at receiver with starting wide receivers CeeDee Lamb and Brandin Cooks, but there's not much home run ability. Lamb has that extra gear with the ball in his hands, and can get deep, yet the offense doesn't ask him to do that.\n\nCooks was brought in last year in to be the deep threat, but he wasn't used in that capacity either. The veteran WR was used more as an intermediate option and came up big in key moments more than he was used to go over the top of defenses.\n\nThird-year wide receiver KaVontae Turpin could be the answer, but despite their insistence he'd be used more in the passing game last season, that never materialized. Turpin had just 18 targets.\n\nAt tight end, Jake Ferguson has the athleticism to be a big-play guy, yet he had just eight plays of over 20 yards last season. Ferguson excels in the middle of the field, and he's better as a runner after the catch, but he doesn't scare defenses.\n\nThe Cowboys finished fifth in the league in yards per game and first in points last year, but they don't have enough speed or playmakers currently on offense. They were tied for ninth-worst in the NFL with just seven plays of over 40 yards in the passing game, and had just one rush of over 40 yards.\n\nNothing the team has done this offseason has demonstrated they'll get better at creating explosive plays in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prescott is playing on the final year of his deal, which has paid him $61 million this season, the largest cap hit by any player in the NFL this season. Lamb will be playing in the final year of his rookie contract this upcoming season and is looking to get an extension before the season starts.\n\nAccording to ESPN NFL reporter Jeremy Fowler, there is a delay in the contract extension for Lamb, possibly since the Cowboys have not made any progress in negotiating a contract adjustment/extension with Prescott.\n\nPrescott is currently in the final year of his contract and has a large cap hit. Although the Cowboys would like to renegotiate his contract, they have also stated that they are willing to play this season with him on his current deal.\n\n\"But their negotiations so far with Dak have been described to me as passive or even nonexistent,\" Fowler said. \"There really hasn't been anything going on, so their actions are saying that maybe if they have to sit on his $61 million cap hit this year then figure it out later then they'll do that.\"\n\n\"And CeeDee Lamb, so they're going to pay somebody eventually. But my sense is they need to figure out the Dak Prescott situation first before they get to Lamb and the market is pretty well set now for WRs, you're looking at about $30M a year.\n\n\"Brandon Aiyuk in San Francisco could get a deal done there, Justin Jefferson in Minnesota, so there would be more market resets for Lamb to get even more money.\"\n\nAside from CeeDee Lamb and Dak Prescott, the Dallas Cowboys also have to pay Micah Parsons\n\nNot only do the Dallas Cowboys have to worry about paying Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb, but they also have to pay edge rusher Micah Parsons.\n\nThe team recently picked up his fifth-year option for the 2025 season and picked it up as he was listed as a defensive end, saving the team around $3 million in cap space. Lamb and Prescott are set to become free agents after this season if they don't get an extension, but Parsons is under contract for the next two seasons.\n\nStill, it would be smart to pay Parsons sooner rather than later. With Dak Prescott due for an extension, the QB market has exceeded $55 million annually, while the wide receiver market has exceeded $30 million annually.\n\nThe edge rushing position has exceeded $30 million annually, with Nick Bosa being paid $34 million a season now.\n\nThe Cowboys have a lot of work to do with extending their star players, but the sooner they do it, the better.\n\nIf you use any of the above quotes, please credit Jeremy Fowler, ESPN, and Sportskeeda", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_gullo@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Robert Gullo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Golden Gophers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/7db74-17150241843366-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541400", "eventUri": "eng-9541400", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Brown to a three-year contract worth $86 million.\n\nAccording to one prominent agent familiar with the wide receiver market, St. Brown and Brown's contracts will serve as the guideposts for Lamb when any negotiations get underway with the Cowboys.\n\n\"Those two deals will only help CeeDee,\" the agent told Heavy, on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a player he doesn't represent. \"They push the No. 1 wide receiver market above $30 million annually. CeeDee will probably reset the market based on how Dallas does deals.\"\n\nIf the Cowboys stay true to form and plan on making Lamb the NFL's highest-paid receiver, it may require lowering Prescott's cap number to make that kind of deal possible.\n\nThe Cowboys' cap constraints have been well documented this offseason, with Prescott's cap number a driving force behind limiting Dallas' flexibility.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, only four teams have less cap space than the Cowboys' $4.49 million in spending flexibility this offseason.\n\nHowever, with Prescott's deal off the books in 2025, the Cowboys will have approximately $83.1 million in cap space, representing the ninth-most in the NFL. Then, in 2026, the Cowboys are projected to have approximately $283.06 million in cap space, the sixth-most in the league.\n\nThose projections are bound to change once the Cowboys reach some sort of eventual resolution with Prescott, Lamb, and Parsons.

The Cowboys, however, never called.\n\nAppearing with Adam Schein of SiriusXM Mad Dog Radio, Cowboys executive V.P. Stephen Jones addressed the failure to make a phone call to Henry.\n\n\"Well, first of all, nothing but respect for Derrick Henry,\" Jones said. \"I mean, he's one of the top backs in this league. He's had one of the great careers in this league. I wish him nothing but the best with the Ravens. I'm sure a great place for him. Our situation is just, you know, and no one ever wants to say it, but it's salary cap, and we just didn't have the money to allocate to that position in terms of where we were from a cap standpoint, knowing what we're looking at with Dak [Prescott] and certainly Micah [Parsons] and CeeDee Lamb. We just didn't have those type of resources to allocate to that position or we probably would've already had it filled with Tony Pollard. We hated to lose Tony Pollard. We had to lose Zeke the year before from a cap standpoint. And, you know, we just didn't have the dollars to allocate to the running back position. And, certainly, looking to do it in a more efficient way in terms of how it complements the rest of our offensive roster.\"\n\nIf they had reached a deal to extend the contracts of Prescott and/or Lamb, however, their cap numbers for 2024 -- $55.45 million and $17.991 million, respectively -- would have dropped, creating room for other positions. That's how these things go. Cap space gets created, can gets kicked, team can go all in, or something like it.\n\nThe problem is the Cowboys didn't strike a deal with Prescott or Lamb. And it won't get any cheaper to wait. Unless, of course, they'll be letting Prescott leave via free agency after the 2024 season. As to Lamb, delay will drive the price up as more and more other receivers do new deals.\n\nThe Cowboys need to stop the bleeding. They have a habit of waiting too long, like they did with Dak.\n\nIt has kept them from pursuing better options in the offensive backfield in 2024.\n\nAnd if they wanted to keep Pollard, here's what they should have done. They shouldn't have tagged him in 2023, because no one would have offered him a compensation package for last year in excess of $10 million, not with a broken ankle suffered in the playoff loss to the 49ers. They could have signed him to a multi-year deal with manageable cap numbers in 2023 and 2024 -- if they'd been willing to take the chance of losing him to the open market.\n\nAgain, he was recovering from a broken ankle. They overpaid him last year, lost him this year. And now they'll be relying on Ezekiel Elliot 3.0 (at 3.5 yards per carry in 2023) and Rico Dowdle to do the job.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Pollard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Pollard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Dowdle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rico Dowdle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e5eed7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5257x2957+0+274/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd9%2F36%2Fc706ff734b90ac92059250130f30%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D22759352", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541400", "eventUri": "eng-9541400", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Owner Jerry Jones stated last month that he is waiting for leaves to fall before they can make some significant moves and re-sign their impending contracts, but that hasn't happened either. But Jerry Jones insists that he wants Prescott back, and he is in regular communication with him.\n\nHowever, it seems progress hasn't yet been made on any contract negotiations. With CeeDee Lamb and Parsons next in line for the big contracts, Jerry Jones might have to find a solution to Dak's contract situation quickly. With no extension on the cards so far, they carry $61 million in dead cap and $55 million in cap hit this season if they don't extend.\n\nAs per NFL.com, the Cowboys owner recently stated that he is not worried about Dak being in his last year. But maybe he should be concerned because Dak is open to looking for new scenery after the 2024 season if a lucrative deal isn't on the cards. Yet, he made it crystal clear that his heart still lies with Dallas.\n\nAs of two weeks ago, no contract discussions had begun, though Dak Prescott asserted it could begin shortly. The Cowboys QB also asserted that he is willing to agree to a mutually beneficial contract for the team, which might be music to that front office. But once the contract extension of both Jordan Love and Tua comes, the Cowboys won't be able to control the market forces, and they would have to shell out big bucks.\n\nWhile they drafted plenty of O-Linemen and D-Linemen, they barely made any moves in free agency, signing a solitary Linebacker. Moreover, this off-season was full of running backs changing homes, but Jerry Jones failed to sign one, with the demand sum a bit too high for him ($9-$10 million). They eventually ended up signing Zeke on a year-long deal.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are the biggest franchise in the NFL, and the only thing bigger than Jerry's club is his ego. Or, that's what the comment sentiment has become. After promising fans they were all in, Jones played the waiting fame, and now the Cowboys find themselves between a rock and a hard place.\n\nStephen A. Smith sees this very well and can't help but point his finger at Jerry Jones. During a recent episode of First Take, Smith voiced his confusion about what the team and its front office actually do.\n\nThey lost LT Tyron Smith, Gallup, Tony Pollard, Dorance Armstrong, Dante Fowler, Jonathan Hankins, and Stephen Gilmore. They also missed out on getting Derrick Henry, who has since joined hands with the Ravens. Smith feels that a few of these crucial signings, especially Henry, would have moved mountains for the franchise.\n\nIt can be said with certainty that Mike McCarthy will be gone after next season, and so will Dak Prescott if they don't put their foot on the gas. The waiting game won't end well, just like the last time when they ended up giving him a $160 million contract.\n\nOne reason for them to back out of inking an extension with Dak could be the asking price, which ranges between $55 and $60 million. This much money for a QB who has yet to deliver in the postseason might not seem wise to many. For now, it's nothing but uncertain.

The contract includes a no-franchise tag clause and a no-trade clause.\n\nThis could be Prescott's final year in Dallas if a deal does not get done, as he will be a free agent at the end of the 2024 season, but the quarterback says there has been some communication about getting something done. Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones says getting a new contract done is a \"priority\" saying the reason it has not happened yet is because franchise quarterback contracts \"take time.\"\n\nPrescott has seen success in Dallas, but that success has stopped at the playoffs. Since he joined the Cowboys in 2016, the farthest the team has made it is the divisional round. Despite what appears to be a playoff curse in Dallas, Jones is confident that Prescott can help the team win a Super Bowl.\n\n\"Absolutely. I mean, I totally think Dak can lead us to a championship,\" Jones said. \"He does everything the right way. He's certainly the leader of this football team. He keeps everybody motivated in the offseason. He's got everybody working out and doing all the things that it takes to put in the work to give yourself every opportunity to win a championship.\"\n\nJones addressed the playoff losses, saying, \"It just so happens that sometimes that old oblong football doesn't bounce your way. And we've had some tough breaks and tough games there in the postseason.\"\n\nThe oblong football has not bounced the Cowboys way to get them to a championship since 1995, but the feeling from the team is that No. 4 can be the one to bring them to the promise land.\n\nJones reflected on the positives of the Dak Era and says his team is consistently a contender in the NFL. Last season, Prescott led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes and 410 completions. He also had 4,516 yards, a 69.5 completion percentage and nine interceptions.\n\n\"But we've won 12 games three years in a row,\" he said. \"I think that's right at the top in terms of what teams have done over a three-year period. And we're hanging around the rim. We've just gotta go up there and grab it, to use a basketball term, and dunk it in. We're hanging around the rim. We just got to get the job done.\"\n\nThere is no guarantee that Prescott will remain a Cowboy, but owner Jerry Jones has also been adamant that they want to keep him around.\n\n\"We want Dak Prescott. That's that,\" the owner said.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shanna_mccarriston@cbssports.com", "name": "Shanna McCarriston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/02/3f341ffc-350a-44cc-a7b1-ff995e8ae639/thumbnail/1200x675/f777649c682d0d954d4fcfd7de238809/dak-prescott-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541400", "eventUri": "eng-9541400", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 452726246, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 14, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 14}}}

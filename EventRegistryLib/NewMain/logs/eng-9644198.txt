Tyson produces about one-fifth of the beef, chicken, and pork sold in the United States.

The charges are the Tyson scion's second known scrape with the law. Just months after he was appointed to the CFO post in 2022, Tyson went to sleep in a strange woman's bed in her Fayetteville, Arkansas home. Police said the woman did not know Tyson. The CFO was arrested for public intoxication and criminal trespass after the incident; He later apologized to employees in an email and said he would get counseling for his drinking.\n\nTyson is the son of board chairman John H. Tyson and the great-grandson of the company's founder, making him a fourth-generation member of the Tyson family. His aunt, Barbara Tyson, serves as a board member.\n\nIn a statement on its website on Thursday, the company said it was \"aware\" that Tyson had been arrested for an alleged DWI and that it had suspended him effective immediately. Tyson named Curt Calaway as interim CFO in his stead. Tyson himself called his prior conduct embarrassing and told employees that the mistake was a serious one that prompted him to \"reflect on the impact my actions can have on others.\"\n\n\"This may be the end of the line for Mr. Tyson,\" warned Georgetown University assistant professor Jason Schloetzer, an expert in corporate governance. It would be reasonable for Tyson's leave to extend into a longer period of time, and if he returns to the company, it might be in a lower-profile role, Schloetzer told Fortune.\n\n\"Large firms tend to seek market-facing executives who bring stability and confidence to the company,\" he said. \"This second incident, if true, can significantly harm that confidence.\"\n\nThe company's brands include Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park and was founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson and has traditionally been shepherded by family leadership. Its motto is We Feed the World Like Family, and the company is headquartered in Springdale, Ark. and has 139,000 employees. John R. Tyson earned compensation valued at $2.9 million in 2023, according to company records.\n\nC-suite executives of large publicly traded companies like Tyson are rarely in the news for arrests, to say nothing of incurring two sets of charges in a two-year span. Another Arkansas executive, Douglas Ramsey of vegan giant Beyond Meat, was arrested in 2022 for allegedly biting a man's nose after a football game in Fayetteville. Ramsey previously spent 30 years at Tyson Foods before leaving for Beyond Meat. He retired in October following his September 2022 arrest.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_gerut@fortune.com", "name": "Amanda Gerut", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John R.

Tyson after he was arrested for DUI and careless driving in Arkansas. Curt Calaway will serve as interim CFO. This marks the second arrest in two years for Tyson, the founder's great-grandson, raising questions about his continued role at the company.\n\nTyson Foods suspended its chief financial officer, John R. Tyson, on Thursday after police in Arkansas arrested and charged him with driving while intoxicated and careless driving. The U.S. meatpacker said Curt Calaway, a senior finance executive with nearly two decades at the company, will take over as interim CFO.\n\nIt was the second time in under two years that the great-grandson of the company's founder, John W. Tyson, was arrested. Shares of the Springdale, Arkansas-based company were down 1.8% at $53.75 in afternoon trading.\n\nThe University of Arkansas police arrested and handcuffed John R. Tyson, 34, and released him nine hours later. He could not be immediately reached for a comment. A police corporal saw John R. Tyson drive his silver SUV partially on a curb and grass while making an improper turn early on Thursday, according to a police report. Tyson's eyes appeared bloodshot and watery and he smelled of intoxicants, the report said.\n\nJohn R. Tyson initially denied drinking but later said he consumed about five to seven Miller Lite beers at a bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the report said. His blood alcohol tested 0.191, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, according to police. Tyson was previously arrested for criminal trespassing and public intoxication in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in November 2022, the same year he became CFO. A college-aged female was alarmed to have found Tyson, who she did not know, asleep in her bed upon returning home, according to the Fayetteville police report in 2022.\n\nThe company at the time announced that a committee of its board members would review the incident, but Tyson continued in his role. John R. Tyson apologized for the arrest on a quarterly earnings call. \"At some point, the board will need to decide when enough is enough,\" said Arun Sundaram, analyst with CFRA Research. \"It's difficult to imagine many other high-ranking executives retaining their positions after several legal incidents.\"\n\nJohn R. Tyson's father, John H. Tyson, chairs the board and the family holds a majority of the company's stock.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John R.

Tyson after he was arrested for intoxication for a second time.\n\nThe U.S. meatpacker said Curt Calaway, a senior finance executive at the company, will take over as interim CFO.\n\nJohn R. Tyson, 34, was arrested early Thursday by University of Arkansas police in Fayetteville, Arkansas, according to police records. He was also charged with careless driving and making an illegal turn.\n\nMr. Tyson was released from custody later Thursday on a $1,105 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court on July 15.\n\nSpringdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods said in a statement Thursday that it was aware of the arrest and immediately suspended John R. Tyson. He is the great-grandson of the company's founder, John W. Tyson, and a former investment banker who joined Tyson Foods in 2019.\n\nHe also serves on the board of directors of Winrock International (Winthrop Rockefeller International), where he co-chairs the audit committee. Furthermore, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an American think-tank whose membership has included senior politicians, secretaries of state, CIA directors, bankers, professors, and CEOs.\n\nNTD contacted Tyson Foods for comment but did not receive a response by press time.\n\nMr. Tyson's suspension comes as the meatpacker has warned that consumers are still under pressure from persistent inflation and that higher commodity costs could weigh on its upcoming results.\n\nIt was the second time in less than two years that Mr. Tyson was arrested on alcohol-related charges. In November 2022, he was charged with public intoxication and criminal trespassing after allegedly entering a college-aged female's home in Fayetteville and falling asleep in her bed.\n\nThe company then called it a personal matter but announced that a committee of its board members would oversee and review it.\n\nCorporate governance experts also suggested then that Tyson Foods, the maker of Ball Park hotdogs, should hire an external firm to conduct a review of the arrest.\n\nMr. Tyson sent a companywide email apologizing for that 2022 incident, saying he was embarrassed and was getting counseling for alcohol abuse. He later pleaded guilty to those charges and settled them by paying fines and court fees.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John R.

New date, health updates, odds", "body": "The highly anticipated bout between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul hit a bump last week when it needed to be postponed after Tyson failed a medical examination following an ulcer flare-up on a flight. Despite the hiccup though, both fighters were adamant that the tilt was still on.\n\nLess than a week later, the fight had a new date, and the jawing between both combatants resumed.\n\nWith the fight back on, here are the latest rumors concerning the fight.\n\nBoxing News: Boxing star Ryan Garcia arrested for felony vandalism at Beverly Hills hotel\n\nDespite both Tyson and Paul's willingness to make this fight happen, Tyson is still very much at risk to miss the fight yet again. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) head of communications Tela Mange spoke to World Boxing News recently to remind everyone that just because a new date is set does not mean the fight is happening for sure.\n\n\"TDLR rules state that licensure does not automatically authorize an individual to participate in an event if their health or safety could be compromised,\" said Mange. \"As I think I've said before, the Department will stay informed about the health of the combatants and will obtain more information if needed to protect their health and safety. In addition to pre-licensing medical screening, TDLR's ringside physicians also conduct pre-fight physicals before the event.\"\n\nThis means that Tyson could be pulled from the fight as late as the day of the event. Mage does not indicate how close to the actual fight start time that Tyson could be pulled, but it seems like until that first bell rings, there is a chance we do not see this fight happen at this new date.\n\nThe original date for the fight, July 20, was set to take place on a Saturday night. The new date, November 15, is a Friday, which is not commonplace for major boxing events. So, why the change?\n\nThe venue for the fight is still AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas - home of the Dallas Cowboys. November is the middle of the NFL season, and lo and behold, the Dallas Cowboys will be hosting the Houston Texans on Monday, November 18. Stadium personnel want the fight to happen on Friday to give the team enough time to prep the stadium for the game just three days later.\n\nThe original date was clear of any major sports conflict outside of Major League Baseball, making the November 15 date that much harder to plan.

'I see that bad dog look in his eye now. It's like when you don't trust a bad dog, it might bite ya at any time. That's the look he's got.\n\n'I remember that look from 25 years ago, it's kind of scary,' Hogan added after thinking all the way back to 1999.\n\nSatisfied with that assessment, Hogan went on to say that he's happy the bout was postponed from July 20 after Tyson suffered a medical episode that has since been described as an 'ulcer flareup.'\n\nHulk Hogan and Mike Tyson (right) arrive at the Premiere Of 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' in 2005\n\nMike Tyson, Nakisa Bidarian and Jake Paul pose onstage during a May 16 press conference\n\nRead More Mike Tyson sends chilling warning to Jake Paul\n\nThe issue occurred last month on a cross-country flight to Los Angeles.\n\nParamedics later boarded the plane to treat him after it had touched down in LA.\n\nOnce the plane landed at LAX, there was another delay of around 25 minutes while the paramedics treated Tyson.\n\n'I'm excited about it,' Hogan said. 'I'm kind of glad it's rescheduled because I don't want any excuses. I want both men at 100% .\n\n'And I've got a feeling this is gonna be the fight of the century, brothers. This is gonna be a good one.'\n\nDespite his health scare, Tyson remains supremely confident of winning by knockout on the new November date.\n\nIn a video message recorded last week, the boxing legend warned Paul after their fight was officially rescheduled: 'Different date, same fate. Imma knockout Jake Paul.'\n\nJake Paul speaks onstage during the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson press conference in Texas\n\nSince the May press conference, Tyson has suffered an 'ulcer flareup' that delayed the bout\n\nGiven many were uncomfortable with it going ahead beforehand, Tyson's health scare has sparked even more concern over the fight icon's safety heading into the rearranged date with Paul.\n\nUFC President Dana White has branded the contest 'f****ng ridiculous' while highlighting the worrying age gap between the two men.\n\n'God, no,' White said, when asked if he had anything to do with it.\n\n'When this fight happens, Tyson will be 58 f***ing years old.

The reason? Mike Tyson's reported ulcer flare up, which occurred while the former heavyweight champion was on a plane in flight to Los Angeles last week. \"During a follow up consultation on Thursday with medical professionals on his recent ulcer flare up, the recommendation is for Mike Tyson to do minimal to light training over the next few weeks.\" With that in mind, the statement makes clear that Tyson will be ready to engage in full training in the near future.\n\n\"Both Mike and Jake are in agreement that it is only fair to ensure that both athletes have equal training time to prepare for this important match,\" the statement continued. \"The health and well-being of athletes is our top priority and well fully support Mike in taking the necessary time to allow him to perform at the level he expects of himself.\" A new fight date has not been set, but the press release states \"the new date of the fight will be announced by next Friday, June 7th.\"\n\nOf course, the idea of a Tyson match against Paul isn't making everyone happy. Boxing is a dangerous sport - and it only gets more dangerous as a fighter ages. Tyson will be closer to sixty than he will be to fifty if and when he and Paul actually throw down in the ring. Paul, on the other hand, is only in his twenties. And while he certainly doesn't have the illustrious background Tyson does, Paul is not without talent, nor is he without power. In other words, people shouldn't be surprised if Tyson ends up getting hurt in a fight with Paul (for whatever reason).\n\nWith all that being said, people tend to be stuck in their memories sometimes. Therefore, many are expecting the Tyson who bested Michael Spinks to be the Tyson who takes on a young man thirty years younger than he is. That, perhaps, is why the show might go on. People want to see the old Mike Tyson, even though that Mike Tyson is long gone. People also want to see the brash Paul get what they believe he deserves...which is knocked out.

However, after the 57-year-old Tyson suffered a medical episode while boarding a plane, the bout was officially postponed to November 15 in order to give Tyson ample time to recover and properly prepare.\n\nBut Johnson thinks they should scrap it altogether.\n\n\"He's 58 years old,\" Johnson said recently on The MMA Hour. \"I don't know what his health history is, and I think the biggest thing is you have someone who is 58 years old trying to push his body to the absolute limit, moving. I don't know if he's sparring or anything like that. I love Jake Paul, I just think there are so many f*cking boxers out there that he can fight and build, pad his record with. I understand Mike Tyson is a big name and Netflix wants to do it, but I don't think they should revisit it.\n\n\"There are plenty of guys out there that Jake Paul could fight. KSI is one of them. He could fight T-Wood [Tyron Woodley] again. He could fight Mike Perry, 'Platinum.' He could fight Jorge Masvidal. There are so many guys! He could fight Anthony Pettis. There are so many guys who are younger than Mike Tyson but a little bit older than him that he can beat and have a big name. But I just think him fighting Mike Tyson, the guy is 58. I don't want to see Mike Tyson get hurt. For what? ... This is the stupidest f*cking thing that's happening right now. You're tell me there is literally nobody out there that can fight Jake Paul that's his age, that is 8-0 as a boxer?\"\n\nOf course, the goal is not just to find someone to fight Paul, but to find someone notable. Tyson vs. Paul is expected to be the first fight broadcast live on Netflix, and given the access the streaming giant provides worldwide, the bout figures to be one of the biggest fights of the year, if not the century. It's also a classic Paul fight, as he's facing a star who is significantly older than he is, as he did with Ben Askren, Woodley, Anderson Silva, and Nate Diaz. But for Johnson, that schtick is wearing thin.\n\n\"If they want something that's big, get a very good boxer that's really good and have [Paul] fight him,\" Johnson argued. \"His skills should sell enough. I'm not here for a f*cking circus. I'm here for, are you legit or not? Fight a legit boxer who is 8-0.\n\n\"Let's have a legit boxing promoter like Eddie Hearn give us somebody. 'Hey, who do you think would be a good fight for Jake Paul? Who?' Ask Eddie Hearn that and see if he can get the guy to sign on the dotted line and have a fight.\"\n\nAnd \"Mighty Mouse\" has the perfect guy: The face of BKFC, Mike Perry.\n\nPaul has flirted with the idea of fighting Perry for some time, even having \"Platinum\" serve as the backup fighter for his matchup against Nate Diaz. Recent reports have even linked the pair to a potential dance date, however nothing is yet official.\n\nBut that's the matchup Johnson wants to see.\n\n\"Bare-knuckle fighting, absolutely not.\" Johnson said when asked if Paul could beat Perry.\n\n\"You know what, I don't know. It's boxing rules. One of the things Mike Perry does very well is he puts a lot of damage on his opponents with bare knuckles. With those gloves, I don't know if he can do the same type of damage, because cutting someone in the face and all that stuff, I don't think he could do that. But I would watch.\n\n\"I'm more excited to see Mike Perry vs. Jake Paul in a boxing match. Netflix, f*cking sign it. Mike Perry vs. Jake Paul. ... That's a way better selling fight than Jake Paul and Mike Tyson. Let Mike Tyson enjoy his retirement. Don't bring that man back to fighting. Let him enjoy the rest of his life and let Mike Perry and Jake Paul fight.\"", "source": {"uri": "mmafighting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Fighting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jed_meshew@mmafighting.com", "name": "Jed Meshew", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Perry_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Perry (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Woodley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Woodley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KSI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Hearn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Hearn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Masvidal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Masvidal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Pettis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Pettis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_Knuckle_Fighting_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zu8-D0eoHghzazTW7H62eFyxNNE=/0x0:8640x4320/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25476523/2153320200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644198", "eventUri": "eng-9644198", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 103}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 274}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Tyson after he was arrested for a second time in two years.\n\nThe US meat giant acted after Mr Tyson was held for an alleged offence of drinking while intoxicated.\n\nIn November 2022, he was arrested after being found asleep in a stranger's house. He plead guilty to the charges.\n\nTyson Foods, in response to the latest incident, issued a brief statement. It read: \"We are aware that John Randal Tyson, chief financial officer of Tyson Foods, was arrested for an alleged DWI. Tyson Foods has suspended Mr. Tyson from his duties effective immediately and named Curt Calaway as interim chief financial officer.\"\n\nShares in the Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean owner stood at $53.76 at 15:12 GMT, down 1.77% on the day.\n\nMr Tyson, the son of the company's chairman and great-grandson of its founder, joined the business in 2019. His appointment to the position of CFO was announced in September, two months before his first arrest.\n\nCalaway has spent 18 years at Tyson Foods, working in a series of finance roles. Since June 2022, Calaway has been the company's senior vice president for finance, corporate development and treasurer.\n\nIn the year to 30 September 2023, Tyson Foods ran up a $649m loss, compared to a $3.25bn profit the year previous. It booked an operating loss of $395m, against an operating income of $4.41bn a year earlier.\n\nThe group posted an \"adjusted\" operating income of $933m, down 79% against he previous 12 months.\n\nSales stood at $52.88bn, down 0.8% on the year.\n\nTyson Foods' most recent set of results was published last month. The company raised its guidance for adjusted operating income on the basis of an improving outlook for the chicken segment of its protein portfolio.\n\nThe group upped its outlook for adjusted operating income for chicken to $700-900m, from the $500-700m provided at the first-quarter results announcement in February.\n\nThat boosted the group adjusted operating income guidance for fiscal 2024 to a range of $1.4-1.8bn, compared to $1-1.5bn previously. The non-GAAP measure rose 58% in the first half to $817m.\n\nOverall group sales are, however, still expected to be flat over the course of fiscal 2024 compared to the $52.8bn for the previous 12 months.

The wrestling legend is advocating for the boxer after a medical emergency during a flight prevented him from honoring his original fight date this summer. While Tyson recovers, Hogan is reminding people he's called \"Iron\" Mike Tyson for a reason.\n\nThe Hulkster took some time out of his day to speak to TMZ about the fight, which, as mentioned, was moved on the 2024 TV schedule to stream live in November for those with a Netflix subscription. The hosts asked about the vast 30-year age difference between the fighters and if that will impact the outcome of the fight, and Hogan made it pretty clear how he feels about that:\n\nBeyond being friends with Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, Hulk Hogan has another bizarre connection to this potential super fight. Hogan has alleged for years that Vince McMahon wanted to have him face off against Tyson in 1990 in the WWE, but as Atletifo noted, plans were derailed when Tyson lost to Buster Douglas in the Tokyo Dome. McMahon extended the offer to Douglas, who then served as a guest referee in a match between Hogan and Randy Savage on Saturday Night's Main Event.\n\nWhile Jake Paul has gone to great lengths to dismiss rumors of fake rules and rigging the fight for entertainment, Hulk Hogan confirmed he did ask the brother of United States Champion Logan Paul if that was what was happening here. Unsurprisingly, he got the same answer from The Problem Child he's given publicly to those who have asked the same:\n\nI believe Jake Paul when he says that, beyond the fact that he's had no problem knocking out older fighting champions prior to this. The fighter helped his brother Logan when he took on Roman Reigns at Crown Jewel in 2022, and he threw the weakest fake punch I've ever seen in a pro wrestling bout. I'm not sure Jake Paul could fake a fight if he tried, giving him no choice but to go all-out on Mike Tyson.\n\nIt should also be noted that while Paul was trolling Tyson at first, he's actually put on quite a bit of weight for the fight. For all the criticism he gets for his choice of opponents and antics, it does legitimately seem like he was preparing for a real fight with the legend and hoping he didn't get defeated by someone decades older than him. Hopefully, we will eventually get to see these two square off, and maybe Hulk Hogan can be ringside to deliver a leg drop to whoever loses.\n\nTyson vs. Paul is rescheduled to stream live on Netflix on November 15th.

Tyson: 'I'm Not Here For A Circus'", "body": "Demetrious Johnson is not a fan of Jake Paul fighting Mike Tyson.\n\nTyson and Paul were originally scheduled to face each other inside the 80,000-seat AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Saturday, July 20. However, their highly anticipated clash was postponed after Tyson experienced a medical emergency during a cross-country flight last month. Fortunately, the incident was attributed to nothing more than an ulcer flare-up. Still, Tyson was forced to take a break from training, prompting promoters to push the fight from this summer to November 15.\n\nJohnson, on the other hand, thinks they should just scrap the whole thing altogether, or at the very least, find an opponent for 'The Problem Child' who isn't 30+ years his elder.\n\n\"He's 58 years old,\" Johnson said of Tyson during an appearance on The MMA Hour. \"I don't know what his health history is, and I think the biggest thing is you have someone who is 58 years old trying to push his body to the absolute limit, moving. I don't know if he's sparring or anything like that. I love Jake Paul, I just think there are so many f*cking boxers out there that he can fight and build, pad his record with. I understand Mike Tyson is a big name and Netflix wants to do it, but I don't think they should revisit it.\n\n\"There are plenty of guys out there that Jake Paul could fight. KSI is one of them. He could fight T-Wood [Tyron Woodley] again. He could fight Mike Perry, 'Platinum.' He could fight Jorge Masvidal. There are so many guys! He could fight Anthony Pettis. There are so many guys who are younger than Mike Tyson but a little bit older than him that he can beat and have a big name.\n\n\"But I just think him fighting Mike Tyson, the guy is 58. I don't want to see Mike Tyson get hurt. For what? ... This is the stupidest f*cking thing that's happening right now. You're telling me there is literally nobody out there that can fight Jake Paul that's his age, that is 8-0 as a boxer?\" (h/t MMA Fighting).\n\nTyson is one of the biggest names in the history of boxing, amassing a 50-6 record with 44 of his wins coming by way of knockout over the course of his two-decade-long career. Along the way, he captured the undisputed heavyweight world championship, carrying the crown from 1987 to 1990.\n\n'Kid Dynamite' returned to the boxing ring in 2020 for an exhibition bout with fellow legend Roy Jones Jr., but the clash with Paul will be his first professional boxing match since a 2005 loss to Kevin McBride.\n\n\"If they want something that's big, get a very good boxer that's really good and have [Paul] fight him,\" Johnson argued. \"His skills should sell enough. I'm not here for a f*cking circus. I'm here for, are you legit or not? Fight a legit boxer who is 8-0.\n\n\"Let's have a legit boxing promoter like Eddie Hearn give us somebody. 'Hey, who do you think would be a good fight for Jake Paul? Who?' Ask Eddie Hearn that and see if he can get the guy to sign on the dotted line and have a fight.\"\n\nSo if Demetrious Johnson doesn't want to see 'The Problem Child' throw hands with Tyson, who would be a suitable opponent? Well, 'Mighty Mouse' has the perfect candidate in mind: current BKFC star and the King of Violence, 'Platinum' Mike Perry.\n\n\"One of the things Mike Perry does very well is he puts a lot of damage on his opponents with bare knuckles,\" Johnson said. \"With those gloves, I don't know if he can do the same type of damage, because cutting someone in the face and all that stuff, I don't think he could do that. But I would watch.\n\n\"I'm more excited to see Mike Perry vs. Jake Paul in a boxing match. Netflix, f*cking sign it. Mike Perry vs. Jake Paul. ...

Now, the fight is set for November 15 at the AT&T Stadium, at which point Tyson will be 58 years old.\n\nRecently, Paul was hooked up to a lie detector and questioned by his brother Logan, a former boxer who has transitioned to WWE.\n\nWhen asked if he truly believes he will beat Mike Tyson, Paul responded affirmatively, but the lie detector indicated deception and he admitted his nervousness, acknowledging the challenge ahead.\n\nPaul answered several questions about his career, including if he thought he could beat Logan in a fight (yes, true), if he was using performance-enhancing drugs (no, true), and if Tyson's age would impact the fight's outcome (no, true).\n\nIn the meantime, there are rumors that Paul might fight Mike Perry on the originally scheduled July 20 date, but he has not confirmed this.\n\nTyson had to rest after suffering from an ulcer on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles last month. Although there were concerns the fight might be canceled, the former heavyweight world champion has assured fans he will be ready by November.\n\n\"Although we had to postpone the fight, I will resume training shortly. I am thankful to the medical staff that treated me and to MVP, Netflix, and AT&T Stadium for working diligently to find the best reschedule date for all parties,\" Tyson said.\n\n\"While we have a new date, the result will be the same no matter when we fight.

He was widely seen as a potential successor for the roles of chairman and CEO, which were previously held by his grandfather and father.\n\nTyson is a former JPMorgan investment banker with degrees from Harvard and Stanford.\n\nIn November 2022, Tyson was arrested for public intoxication and trespassing after a bizarre incident in which he entered the college-aged woman's home.\n\nThe woman called police to report a potential burglary after discovering \"a male she did not know asleep in her bed,\" according to a police report at the time.\n\nLocal officers detected an odor of intoxicants on Tyson's breath and described his movements as \"sluggish and uncoordinated.\" The entire incident was recorded on police bodycam footage, which was published by TMZ and other lets.\n\nTyson later pleaded guilty to the charges and agreed to pay a $150 fine for each charge, as well as a total of $440 in fees.\n\nAt the time, Tyson also apologized to shareholders for his actions and said he would seek counseling for alcohol abuse.\"\n\n\"I made a serious mistake and this has caused me to reflect deeply on the impact my actions can have on others,\" Tyson said at the time.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John R.

So, it's essentially a father vs. son type of deal with Tyson close to age 60 (57 at the time of publishing).\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, a medical emergency caused by an ulcer flare-up for Tyson canceled the original fight date of July 20 and the two will now compete on November 15. Rumors have randomly started to swirl that Paul may instead fight Mike Perry on the original date while keeping the Tyson year-end date intact. However, over in the UFC, there is concern surrounding the upcoming PPV event of UFC 303 and its main event between Conor McGregor and Michale Chandler at the end of the month. Therefore, prompting UFC bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley to spring into rescue mode and call out Paul for the event.\n\nWell, consider the 9-1 boxer in.\n\n\"MMA fight before Tyson [checkmark emoji]\" Paul quote tweeted at O'Malley. \"100% will kill Omalley in MMA. He's a small man. PFL Vs UFC June 29th\"\n\nThis will never happen, but Paul continues to shoot his shot and tease UFC CEO Dana White as well as an MMA debut. In theory, an MMA fight could still happen, just not against O'Malley.\n\nTechnically under contract with the PFL, Paul has been waiting for the right opponent to eventually get in the cage with. Ideally, the promotion would have his first fight on one of its big PPV events, most likely in Saudi Arabia. The next of which is expected to happen in September.\n\nUltimately, Paul is upset he has to wait on Tyson, but overall health is rightfully atop the priority list.\n\n\"I was definitely pretty devastated but I first and foremost wanted to make sure that Mike was healthy,\" Paul told TMZ. \"I love and respect Mike, and I was pretty devastated for everyone on the undercard as well.\n\n\"This was such an iconic event, but thankfully, Mike's okay, doing great, and we can still run it at a later date. That's what I'm focused on now is getting to November 15 and still giving people a historic fight.\"\n\nPaul admitted yesterday in a YouTube video where he and his brother Logan Paul took lie detector tests that he doesn't actually believe he'll beat Tyson and is nervous for the clash. Despite that, he truthfully -- according to the test -- stated that the boxing match is not rigged.\n\nThe age gap has been one of the biggest factors and problems for the community in response to Paul vs. Tyson. That hasn't stopped anyone from continuing to try and make the match happen and according to Paul, Tyson himself wouldn't be in on it if he saw an issue.\n\n\"Tell Mike Tyson that,\" Paul said. \"He does not give a f*ck what anybody thinks. He's his own boss. He wants to fight me. He told my team like, 'I don't give a f*ck about this. Tell Jake I'm still gonna rip his head off and knock him the f*ck out,' and this just bought him more time. So, tell Mike Tyson not to fight and chill. See how that goes (laughs).\"\n\nGo to Twitter, use the #MorningReport hashtag, or find one of my tweets with it, and drop me a jam you're currently really into. I'll pick the best one alongside my daily choice and give you a shoutout! You can also share in the comments below -- those are just harder to sift through sometimes!\n\nPaul vs. O'Malley would undeniably be quite the freakshow consolation to losing a Conor fight.

This time, it's MMA champion Sean O'Malley.\n\nThe rescheduling of his fight against Tyson left the \"Problem Child\" with plenty of time on his hands. The former heavyweight champion's health problems forced the highly publicized fight to be postponed from July 20 to November 20.\n\nSean O'Malley did not remain silent in the face of the challenge and immediately responded on social media. \"I'll fight @jakepaul to save UFC 303,\" he assured, alluding to the problems that Dana White's promotion has had in securing the main fight for this card.\n\nDespite this and the fact that Paul responded to O'Malley's message saying, \"MMA fight before Tyson,\" it is highly unlikely that this fight will take place. In principle, the \"Problem Child\" signed a contract with the UFC's rival promotion, PFL, and it is difficult for them to allow Paul to fight in an event of their top competitor.\n\nSecondly, there is the weight difference. As bantamweight champion, O'Malley must weigh between 126-135 lbs for each fight. Paul, for his part, went up to over 200 lbs for the fight against Tyson.

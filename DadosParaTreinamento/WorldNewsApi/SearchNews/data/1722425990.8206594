{"id": 243258658, "title": "Knicks' risky OG Anunoby megadeal isn't a $213 million outlier anymore", "text": "There\u2019s a new metric by which to measure the OG Anunoby contract. Put another way: hundreds of millions isn\u2019t what it used to be. The context is the deal freshly agreed upon Friday by Immanuel Quickley, a point guard Knicks fans are certainly familiar with. He\u2019s slated to earn, a league source confirmed, $175 million over five years with the Toronto Raptors. That\u2019s for a player whose greatest NBA accomplishment, with all due respect to that 38-point gem against the Celtics in 2023, is finishing runner-up for Sixth Man of the Year. Why is this relevant to Anunoby? The Knicks traded Quickley for Anunoby. They traded Quickley, in part, because they didn\u2019t want to pay him such a massive sum. They had their chance for a long-term deal before last season, and then allowed the October deadline to pass without an agreement. Back then, the rumors had Quickley desiring $125 million. He gambled on himself \u2014 and the circumstances of the booming NBA salaries \u2014 before receiving an additional $50 million. Anunoby, meanwhile, recently agreed to a hefty five years, $213 million. It sounds daunting considering Anunoby\u2019s injury history, a long list of ailments that has kept him off the court for some of his most important games \u2014 including the entire 2019 championship run with the Raptors. We don\u2019t know if there are any options or games played stipulations in Anunoby\u2019s new contract. Those details probably won\u2019t be uncovered until it\u2019s official. But the initial sticker shock of that Anunoby deal \u2014 the biggest contract in Knicks history \u2014 has been eased by the comparables. First, there\u2019s the combined contracts of Quickley and RJ Barrett, the two players traded for Anunoby. They\u2019re on deals worth a combined $282 million. As proven after the trade, Anunoby is a better fit for the Knicks \u2014 specifically with Jalen Brunson \u2014 than Quickley and Barrett. Then, add this crazy reality: According to Spotrac, Anunoby\u2019s average annual salary is estimated as 28th-highest in the NBA. It\u2019s just below Fred VanVleet. Our expectations of salaries have to be realigned. Did the Knicks overpay for a role player? Yes. Did they egregiously overpay? Not in this market. Did they have to re-sign him? Absolutely. Is it a huge risk? Absolutely times two. The injury stuff is scary. Anunoby hasn\u2019t reached 70 games in a season since he was a rookie in 2017-18. He managed about 20 games with the Knicks before needing surgery. There\u2019s a good chance that the contract will look terrible in its final year when Anunoby is 33. An albatross. But the Knicks aren\u2019t in a position to operate scared. Cautious has been Leon Rose\u2019s philosophy but he switched it up this summer because competing with the Celtics requires gambles. The big one was the trade for Mikal Bridges, which, as I\u2019ve written prior, is also a gamble on Jalen Brunson\u2019s stardom. Andre Igoudala, who knows a few things about backcourt stars from his time with the Warriors, likes that match. \u201cI think Mikal is perfect alongside Jalen Brunson to allow Jalen to be Jalen,\u201d Igoudala said on Carlmelo Anthony\u2019s podcast, \u201c7PM in Brooklyn.\u201d \u201cThey both compliment each other very, very well and I know I spoke on this, I thought Mikal Bridges was the best talent in the city of New York. Now obviously Jalen has proven me wrong because just his IQ is on another level and in the way he\u2019s been able to play. It\u2019s been amazing but everyone\u2019s been asking, how far can the Knicks go with the team they have \u2014 I think Mikal was going to add that perfect balance to Jalen.\u201d The other big gamble is the money handed to Anunoby, the injury-prone Swiss army knife. It\u2019s a large contract and risky but, if you take a look around the NBA cap sheets, it\u2019s also the going rate.", "summary": "There\u2019s a new metric by which to measure the Knicks' OG Anunoby contract.

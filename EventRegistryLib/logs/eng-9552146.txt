Someone without criminal charges\".\n\nHowever, the facility remains under the title 'Michael Slater Oval'.\n\nA photo shared by Councillor Jenny McKinnon on Tuesday shows the monument at the Bolton Park grounds has been altered with Slater's name completely covered up.\n\nMcKinnon, previously the deputy mayor, wrote on Facebook: \"I've urged Council to change the name of this oval as a matter of urgency. Glad to see that someone (maybe Council?) has taken some stealth action.\"\n\nSlater in 2014 was one of three former test cricketers to have an oval named in his honour at the Bolton Park complex, alongside former Test captain Mark Taylor and fast bowler Geoff Lawson.\n\nMayor of the City of Wagga Wagga Rod Kendall celebrated the announcement in 2014. Slater's dad Peter attended the ceremony to unveil the monuments.\n\nMichael Slater Oval also hosts AFL, football and rugby league events, leading to previous calls for the oval to be renamed in honour of one of the many other sporting heroes that have come from the NSW Riverina.\n\nIn 2020 there was a push for Aussie cricketing trailblazer Alex Blackwell, who captained the Aussie women's cricket team, to replace Slater.\n\nSlater, meanwhile, will return to court on May 31.\n\nA court in April heard scores of alleged abusive texts he sent to a woman in a tirade starting from the morning and ending well into the afternoon.\n\nCourt documents showed one chilling message where he said the woman had \"put a good guy in jail\".\n\nThe texts follow similar alleged streams of abuse from the former cricket star towards the same woman since December last year, with police claiming he bombarded her with more than 300 abusive texts.\n\nOn March 10, Mr Slater allegedly sent more than 100 messages and claimed he would kill himself.\n\nDuring the barrage he allegedly wrote: \"Get f**ked you're a fraud, I'm going to hang my skull at the front of my house. How does that f**king feel you c**t. You f**king killed me.\"\n\nDetails of some of the alleged messages, along with his alleged physical abuse of the woman, were raised in court as police opposed Mr Slater's bail application.\n\nSlater is accused of physically assaulting the woman after she attended his home on December 6, 2023 over concerns for his welfare.\n\nPolice allege he struck her across the face, kicked her and raised a bottle of vodka while saying: \"I'll f**king kill you.\"\n\nHe is then alleged to have choked her, lifting her off the ground as she fled to the laundry room.\n\nThis is despite his Legal Aid lawyer Michael Robinson stating the former cricketer would be undertaking a \"major intervention\" by living in a rehabilitation centre in Sydney.\n\nSlater and his legal team have disputed allegations of physical violence.\n\nAffectionately known as \"Slats\" by those close to him, Mr Slater opened the batting for the Australian Test team through the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nHe became one of only four players to have played in each of the 15 matches between 1999 and 2001 - the era that delivered the Australian team the best run of consecutive victories in Test cricket history.\n\nMr Slater scored 5312 Test runs in 74 matches. He also played 42 one-day internationals for Australia.\n\nAfter retiring in 2004, he moved to commentary with channels 7 and 9 and other media networks.\n\nNews.com.au has contacted Councillor

April.\n\nHis name on the sign at the oval was recently painted over and the defacement has prompted Wagga Wagga's mayor to support changing the oval's name.\n\n\"We seriously need to consider renaming this park,\" Dallas Tout said.\n\nThe Wagga Wagga City Council has a policy in place that allows it to change the name of public spaces at its discretion.\n\n\"I'll be voting in favour of putting it out to the community to have it renamed,\" he said.\n\nMurrumbidgee Mankadders president Michael Hargraves said the Wagga Wagga-based club supported the idea of renaming the ground.\n\n\"We've had someone from our tiny community go and be one of the best players in the world, but we've also got him with his alleged charges,\" he said.\n\nWagga Wagga local and gender advocate Jenny Rolfe-Wallace said there were other famous cricketers from the city the field could be named after, including twin sisters Alex and Kate Blackwell.\n\n\"They both played cricket from Australia -- how wonderful would it be to include some gender diversity in our cricketing fields by renaming it after them,\" she said.\n\n\"It would be great to have both of them recognised on the sign.\n\nMs Rolfe-Wallace said the vandalism showed the \"level of frustration that women have at the moment of the lack of action on things that are really important\".\n\nPolice said the vandalism

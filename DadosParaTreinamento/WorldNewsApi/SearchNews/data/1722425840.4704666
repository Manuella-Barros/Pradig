{"id": 243221572, "title": "Family of man shot dead at Lagos fuel queue demands justice", "text": "The family of Toheeb Eniafe has called on the Lagos State Police Command to speed up actions in the investigation to unravel the cause of the death of their breadwinner. Toheeb reportedly died on May 1 from gunshot injuries at a petrol station of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, Obalende, after he was shot by a police officer during a fracas. Our correspondent gathered that during the fuel queue caused by the fuel scarcity in the state, two men believed to be police officers, attempted to drive into the station to buy petrol despite not being in the queue. This was met with stiff resistance from people in the queue, many of whom had been waiting for hours. Eyewitnesses said Toheeb spearheaded the argument, telling the men to join the queue like everyone else which degenerated into a fisticuff and the eventual death of the young man. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement released on May 2, said the Command has identified the police officer who shot Toheeb, adding that the person behind the shooting is a police officer serving at Special Protection Unit Base 17, Lion Building. But while addressing journalists at the press centre of the Lagos State High Court on Thursday, the family lamented the delay in the investigation and said they suspected a conspiracy to cover up the matter. The deceased\u2019s sister, Folashade Eniafe, said, \u201cToheeb was easy-going and was a breadwinner in the family. Our parents are old. They lament over the matter every day. \u201cWe are not hearing anything from the police on this matter on how it happened or what they are doing about it. It appears we are being cheated. The stress is too much. They should have mercy on us and let us know what happened. We don\u2019t have anybody.\u201d Also speaking, Toheeb\u2019s uncle, Sumaimon Eniafe, said, \u201cWe want the policeman identified. We want to know the state of the matter. We are not hearing anything. That\u2019s why we are here for justice. We want the police to complete their investigation immediately and charge the killer in court.\u201d According to the Vice Chairman of the National Road Transport Workers Union, Wale Giwa, who witnessed the shooting, Toheeb was the auditor of the union until his tragic death. When contacted on Thursday, the police spokesman, Hundeyin, said an investigation was still ongoing while allaying fears of any cover-up. \u201cInvestigation is ongoing and development will be made available. We feel their pain and plight (of the family) and we are not sweeping it under the carpet,\u201d the PPRO said. He said the Commissioner of Police, Adegoke Fayoade, had reached out to the homicide section of the state police, urging them to expedite action.", "summary": "<p>The family of Toheeb Eniafe has called on the Lagos State Police Command to speed up actions in the investigation to unravel the cause of the death of their breadwinner.

The next-longest streak since statistics began in 1991 is the 23 consecutive months of year-on-year decline from September 2007 to July 2009, a period that included the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers.\n\nThe drop in real wages in March was also larger than the 1.8% fall in February.\n\nMonthly nominal wages per worker rose 0.6% to \u00a5301,193 on average. Special pay, such as bonuses, fell 9.4% to \u00a521,959 year on year, so the March growth figure was smaller than that for February, for which a final report showed a 1.4% increase.\n\nHowever, regular wages, such as base salaries and overtime pay, climbed 1.5% to \u00a5279,234 on average, apparently reflecting factors including the growing momentum for wage hikes. Nominal wages exceeded the previous year's figure for the 27th consecutive month, also marking the longest streak on record.\n\nIn this year's shunto spring wage negotiations, major companies responded with wage hikes at the highest level in 33 years on average. That has raised hopes for further wage increases from April on, but there are no prospects for inflation to ease.\n\nIn addition, if the depreciation of the yen brings about higher inflation due to rising import prices, some observers believe it will be difficult for real wages to make a positive turnaround.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lehman Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kousei.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552076", "eventUri": "eng-9552076", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-09-", "dateEnd": "2009-07-", "textStart": 639, "textEnd": 666}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

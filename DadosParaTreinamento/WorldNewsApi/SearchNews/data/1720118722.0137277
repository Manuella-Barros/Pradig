We all have faith. Everything will be crystal clear about the change of the government,\u201d he observed.Samal reiterated his earlier claim that the oath-taking ceremony of the BJP\u2019s chief minister will take place on June 10.Senior Congress leader Taraprasad Bahinipati, however, exuded confidence that the exit poll results would prove wrong and his party would reach its target of 90 assembly seats. \u201cI don\u2019t accept the claims of the two parties on government formation. Our president Sarat Pattanayak has said that the Congress, which won nine seats in 2019 elections, would bag 90 out of the 147 assembly seats. We will surely form the new government,\u201d he added.The Congress leader claimed his party would retain the Koraput Lok Sabha seat. Sounding skeptical of the exit poll results, senior BJD leader Padmanabha Behera said, \"the exit polls of different media have different assessments. The exit poll predictions are not always true. The BJD has its own assessment and will again form the government in the state with a good mandate. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik will again take oath on June 9. We will do well in the Lok Sabha elections.\"Earlier on Saturday, senior BJD leader V K Pandian claimed the ruling party in Odisha would secure 15 Lok Sabha constituencies.\u201cThe BJD is winning 85 assembly seats after 3rd phase polls and with the 4th phase today, it will end up winning more than 115 seats out of a total of 147 and 15 Lok Sabha seats out of 21,\" the bureaucrat-turned-politician was quoted as saying to news agency, PTI.", "summary": "Pollsters have predicted that the BJP, which pulled off a surprise performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by winning 8 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state, is likely to double its tally.", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/odisha-bjd-and-congress-rubbish-exit-poll-predictions-896980", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/02/1094280-untitleddesign68.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:31:50", "author": "Akshaya Kumar Sahoo", "authors": ["Akshaya Kumar Sahoo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.259}

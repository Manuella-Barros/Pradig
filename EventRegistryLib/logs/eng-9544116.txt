I officially have a sister.'\n\nThe former Channel 4 star continued: 'Welcome to the family Han, couldn't wish for anyone better.'\n\nJosh and Hannah are childhood sweethearts, having started dating around the age of 17.\n\nMeanwhile, planning a wedding isn't the only thing that will keep Josh busy this year.\n\nThe TV personality announced just days ago that he will be running to be a Labour MP in the next election.\n\nWith the hopes of replacing the Deputy Prime Minister in the seat, he has a lot of campaigning ahead.\n\nAfter he was selected as the parliamentary candidate for the Hertsmere constituency, Josh has gained the backing of the bookies already.\n\nIn fact, William Hill reveals his odds are at 5/2.\n\nWilliam Hill spokesperson Lee Phelps said: 'This was a very unexpected move from Labour, but Hertsmere has only ever been represented by a Conservative MP, so the decision to alter their approach can only be seen as a positive.'\n\nA political run is, of course, a major shift from his reality TV stint.\n\nHe appeared alongside his sister and their parents, mum Nikki and dad Jonathan, on Gogglebox for five years.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

Josh was one of the original stars of Channel 4's smash reality show Gogglebox - featuring on his family sofa from 2013 until 2017. His parent, Jonathan and Nikki, and his younger sister Amy continued to star on the show until 2018.\n\nOn Sunday, Amy took to social media to share photos and videos of a wholesome celebration of Josh and Hannah as they welcomed loved ones around for a celebratory knees up. Photos showed the Tapper family - as well as Hannah - looking smartly dressed and posing together for happy photographs.\n\nSharing the images online, Amy wrote: \"The most special night celebrating my favourite people... Too much love in the room for @joshtapper & @hannahsterman84.\" She also added a sparkly pink emoji and an engagement ring emoji - while videos showed the family and their friends dancing and laughing together.\n\nJosh and Hannah became engaged at the end of March THe couple celebrated with family and friends\n\nJosh and Hannah announced their happy news back in March as they shared a collection of snaps on their respective Instagram grids. Hannah flashed her newly bejewelled hand and wrote: \"here's to forever.\" And other snaps showed her and Josh posing together in a park while she flashed her engagement ring and a dazzling smile.\n\nA further snap at the time showed a table covered in cards of congratulations, bunches of flowers, and helium filled balloons - one in the shape of an engagement ring with a diamond and another of a golden heart. Meanwhile, Josh's sister, 24-year-old Amy - who also featured on Gogglebox - shared her own excitement over the engagement.\n\nIn the aftermath of the engagement announcement, she declared online: \"The phone called I've been waiting for and the best news in the entire world. My friends are engaged. I officially have a sister... Welcome to the family Han, couldn't wish for anyone better.\"\n\nHannah could soon find herself being the wife of a politician - as Josh has been put forward by the Labour Party to fight for Hertsmere, Hertfordshire. He hopes to unseat deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden at the upcoming 2024 General Election - which is itself tipped to take place in the autumn.\n\nThe reality star has set out six targets he aims to achieve if he wins a seat in power - putting a fair economy at the front of his manifesto. He also vows to shorten NHS waiting lists, boost green power initiatives, improve education, boost social and affordable housing and rejuvenate local high streets. The TV star declared: \"Politics is about people, and our communities must be able to trust Labour in Government once again.\"\n\nJosh would be far from the first celebrity to cross from the world of entertainment to politics. The late Glenda Jackson was an Oscar winning actress before joining the Labour Party and becoming a successful MP in the 1990s. While talkshow host Robert Kilroy-Silk shifted from being a TV personality to leader of defunct political party UKIP.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seamus_duff@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Seamus Duff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogglebox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gogglebox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kilroy-Silk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kilroy-Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenda_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenda Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Independence Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Dowden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Dowden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertsmere", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hertsmere"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertsmere"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32748404.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/442213009_458502150193201_2177585148242420554_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544116", "eventUri": "eng-9544116", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

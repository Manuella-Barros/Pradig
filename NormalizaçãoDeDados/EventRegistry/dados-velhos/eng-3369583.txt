Since then, Clemson and Georgia have continued to recruit him and Monday said he probably will be at Clemson for the season opener against Kent State, primarily to see the hosts but also to watch his cousin who plays for the Golden Flashes.\n\n\"I don't want to count them (Clemson) out because I've worked so hard for it I've got to enjoy the moment,\" Monday said. \"I talked to their coaches and they are telling me Clemson is the best place for me because I'd fit right in to the defense and the way I play would be a great fit for them.\"\n\nMonday said Auburn is countering Clemson's argument with its own pitch that he's a great fit for them as well.\n\n\"I've seen everything I need to see out of Auburn so I just need to see more out of Clemson,\" he said adding that his Auburn commitment remains strong. He said he's not sure at this point what Clemson would have to show him to flip him.\n\n\"I've got to keep thinking on that because it's a real hard decision for me because my parents are really involved. I know it's my decision but I've got to include them.\"\n\nMonday said he's not sure when he'll visit Auburn and Georgia this season.", "id": "9757269", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Clemson working hard to flip Auburn commit", "image": "http://www.thestate.com/sports/college/acc/clemson-university/en8hcv/picture167766172/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5247939", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 260, "date": "2017-07-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 269}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "182635", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Georgia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "182942", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "label": {"eng": "Georgia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}, "id": "321592", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers"}, "id": "326126", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Auburn Tigers football"}, "id": "327833", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}, "id": "342562", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 88, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Sporting Goods", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Sporting_Goods"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 983, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1028, "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness"}], "time": "18:54:00"}

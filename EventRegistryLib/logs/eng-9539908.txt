Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nDundas, Ont., native Mackenzie Hughes, the one other Canadian to make the weekend cut, shot a 72 on the day to sit 13 shots out of the lead.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson.

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose Tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki",

The big-hitting Canadian made the most of his Moving Day on Saturday at the 2024 CJ Cup Byron Nelson and utilized a third-round 63 to propel his name to the top of the leaderboard at 19 under. Pendrith's 194 total ties the tournament record for lowest 54-hole score.\n\nPendrith will take a one-stroke lead over Jake Knapp into the final round at TPC Craig Ranch after enduring a frustrating start to his spring. Beginning his year with quality outings at the Sony Open and Farmers Insurance Open, Pendrith hit a snag when tendonitis in his left shoulder flared up.\n\nWith his greatest superpower - his speed - affected, the 32-year-old struggled. Pendrith missed five of six cuts including four straight at one stage and looked like the shell of his usual self. Measures were made to alleviate the stress and has allowed Pendrith to perform like a player of his caliber can over the last month.\n\nBack-to-back T11 finishes the last two weeks set the stage for Pendrith's coming out party at TPC Craig Ranch where he entered the weekend three strokes off the pace. He made up the deficit and then some in the first third of his round not because of his vaunted long game but because of his short game.\n\nA chip-in eagle on the par-5 5th pushed Pendrith to 3 under on the day and a pitch-in eagle on the very next put his name atop the leaderboard by itself. With this stretch, Pendrith became only the third player this year to card back-to-back eagles on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"Obviously a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop. You know, I was just thinking, just keep going. I hit a really nice shot on the next par-3 and hit a good putt; just didn't break enough. But this is kind of a course you can get an a run and make a lot of birdies, and the guys behind me I'm sure were doing the same. Just got to keep the momentum going and try and make as many as you can.\"\n\nWhile Knapp opened with two birdies across his first five holes, the overnight leader stalled in the middle portion of his round. Pendrith took advantage and kept his foot on the gas pedal with birdies on Nos. 9, 12 and 13. There were missed opportunities coming in on Nos. 14 and 18, but Pendrith persisted and is alone in pole position heading into a potentially career-altering final round.\n\n1. Taylor Pendrith (-19)\n\nThe talent has always been there for the Canadian, but unfortunately so have the injuries. He enjoyed a really nice rookie season in 2022 that saw him nab a number of high quality results and a spot on the International Presidents Cup team despite a three-month layoff at one point during the summer. The sky was the limit in his sophomore campaign, but it did not amount to much until this year's FedEx Cup Fall. This year is following a similar trend of his first two where he has gone dark at various stages, but when his upside flashes, it flashes in a big way.\n\n\"Just got to stay aggressive, play my own game, not really worry about the other guys, what they're doing,\" Pendrith said. \"Been playing some nice golf the last few weeks, and it's nice to see it come together. I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself. Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\n2. Jake Knapp (-18)\n\nT3. Ben Kohles, Matt Wallace (-17)\n\nT5. Alex Noren, Kelly Kraft (-15)\n\nT7. Kevin Tway, Vincent Whaley, Byeong Hun An, Troy Merritt (-14)\n\nThe solo 36-hole leader didn't have his best stuff on Saturday, but he did enough to give himself a chance for his second victory of the season Sunday. Knapp knocked in an opening birdie to widen his lead to two and added another four holes later on the first par 5 of the front side.\n\nKnapp's next birdie wouldn't come for another nine holes, and while he was stuck in neutral, others were still in drive. He saw his name drift from the top spot during this time, but he remained patient, tacked on a birdie on 14 and another on 18 to pull him within one. With a win, Knapp would become the first rookie since Xander Schauffele in 2017 to win multiple times and only the second player this season to do so joining world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nKris Kim made history Friday evening when he became the youngest player ever to make the cut at the Byron Nelson. The 16-year-old surpassed previous records held by teenagers by the name of Scottie Scheffler and Jordan Spieth and became the youngest to make the cut on the PGA Tour in nearly a decade. Kim carded his third straight under-par round Saturday with a 1-under 70 and nearly pushed his name into contention with a flurry of early birdies highlighted by a near hole-in-one on the par-3 4th.\n\n\"It's been really cool,\" Kim said. \"Makes it a little bit more fun playing with the crowds in my opinion. It was just such a good experience today.\"\n\nOdds via Sportsline consensus\n\nLet's roll with Knapp. The 36-hole leader made only one putt outside 10 feet all day (his birdie on 18) and was still able to remain in touching distance. The Mexico Open winner leads this field in strokes gained approach thus far and will lean on those clubs to set up ample scoring opportunities on Sunday. Pendrith is tasked with following up a great round with another which is never an easy task, while Knapp seems close to firing a low one of his own.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_mcdonald@cbssports.com", "name": "Patrick McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Open_in_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony Open in Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Insurance_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farmers Insurance Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Merritt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Merritt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexican Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Kraft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Kraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Tway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Tway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/04/295c8b47-1325-4342-8dae-83f2fb1a3183/thumbnail/1200x675/9b189687d476a1130a4f0718166ea8f8/gettyimages-2151463248-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nTaylor Pendrith has been dealing with an ailing left shoulder for over a year now, but that has not slowed him down at the CJ Up Byron Nelson.\n\nHe powered through the pain at TPC Craig Ranch, carding an 8-under 63 on Saturday to shoot up the leaderboard and into the lead at 19-under -- the Canadian leads by one over Jake Knapp after 54 holes.\n\n\"Been playing some nice golf the last few weeks, and it's nice to see it come together,\" Pendrith said.\n\n\"I think I just need to stay patient and play my own game. I can't get ahead of myself. Make as many birdies as you can because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith's went very low on Saturday, thanks to a hot start. After opening with a par-birdie-par start, he chipped in for an eagle on back-to-back holes at the par-5 5th and the short par-4 6th.\n\nSuddenly, Pendrith found himself at 16-under par and in a share of the lead.\n\n\"It was nice to see those fall. The first one had a little bit of speed on the chip, and it hit the pin right in the middle, went around, and dropped into the hole,\" Pendrith said to Amanda Renner on the CBS Sports telecast after the round.\n\n\"The second one was a beautiful shot that rolled in like a putt. Nice to get off to a great start through six holes.\"\n\nPendrith cooled off somewhat after that, making only three birdies over his final 12 holes. Still, he did not make any bogies and is set on securing his first PGA Tour title.\n\n\"It will be a long day. Plenty of birdie opportunities,\" Pendrith said.\n\n\"Getting off to a nice start helps. If I don't, there is no panic. I'm just going to take it one hole at a time and know that I'm probably going to make some birdies at some point, hopefully.\"\n\nA win would send him to the Wells Fargo Championship -- a Signature Event -- and the PGA Championship at Valhalla.\n\nBut it would also help his chances of making the Presidents Cup, which will take place in his native Canada in September. Pendrith played for the International Team in 2022 as well.\n\n\"I haven't had the best of years so far, but it's a huge goal of mine, especially being in Canada, with Mike Weir as the captain,\" Pendrith said.\n\n\"Two years ago was awesome. Getting back to that stage would be amazing, and even more special to be in my home country. It's definitely a goal of mine.\"\n\nPendrith has had an up-and-down season, partially due to his health issues. He has missed the cut in six of the 11 events he has played but also has four top-11 finishes.\n\nHis best result came at Torrey Pines, where he tied for 9th.\n\nPerhaps his season improves drastically on Sunday. Should he go on to win, Pendrith will continue a running trend on the PGA Tour in 2024: entering the winner's circle for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Balionis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Balionis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Weir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Weir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0uYUVxx5mdIT-0LWcAoEXbDo0b4=/0x1219:1724x2081/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25433580/2151453909.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPendrith shot 4-under 67 for a 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch. The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nJordan Spieth, the highest at No. 20, missed the cut for just the second time in 12 appearances at his hometown event. Defending champion Jason Day (22nd) and Tom Kim (23rd) didn't contend, with Day finishing one shot behind Kim at 9 under.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under. Knapp and Wallace were the only players in the top eight with a previous PGA Tour win.\n\nThe start of the final round was pushed back 2 1/2 hours because of overnight rain, and pairings turned into threesomes going off both tees with the players allowed to lift, clean and place shots in the fairway.\n\nWallace appeared to start a charge by chipping in for birdie at 12, the toughest hole of the week, and getting another birdie at the par-4 13th. A three-putt bogey on the par-3 15th stalled him out.\n\nRafael Campos, a 13-year journeyman from Puerto Rico who has spent most of his career on satellite tours, birdied five of the first six holes starting on the back nine to make the turn at 29.\n\nThe 36-year-old cooled off on his second nine before making a 48-foot putt from off the green for eagle on the par-5 ninth for a 63 that put him at 18 under.\n\nTaiga Semikawa, a 23-year-old from Japan playing on a sponsor exemption, also finished at 18 after a 64.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, had a rough finish as the youngest to play a final round on tour in 10 years.\n\nPlaying his final nine on the front, the son of South Korean-born former LPGA Tour player Ji-Hyun Suh had four bogeys and shot 73 to finish 6 under.\n\nKim, who is from England, played on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group.\n\n0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Brown New Iowa law regulates traffic cameras, which generated $1.16 million for Waterloo in 2023\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Leafs,\" said the 32-year-old Canadian from Richmond Hill, just outside of Toronto, when asked about his NHL allegiance.\n\nThe question was pertinent considering that before Pendrith takes to TPC Craig Ranch on Sunday, looking to turn a one-shot lead into his first career PGA Tour title at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, he will be watching Game 7 of the Toronto Maple Leafs' first-round playoff series against the Boston Bruins.\n\n\"Going to go home and get some food and watch the game, be glued to the TV,\" said Pendrith, who said he'll watch the game with just his wife. \"I'm a little nervous, but they looked good last game, so hopefully do as good as Game 6 and be exciting.\"\n\nThe Leafs own 13 Stanley Cup victories, though the storied franchise hasn't won a Cup since 1967.\n\nAs for Pendrith, he's victory drought spans 72 starts since turning pro out of Kent State in 2014. His best career finish on Tour was a runner-up at the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic. This season, Pendrith has had a true mixed bag with six missed cuts in 11 starts but also four finishes of T-11 or better, including T-11's in each of his past two starts.\n\n\"I feel like my putting has been really good all year,\" Pendrith said. \"I usually drive it well, and I haven't been driving it great. The last few weeks I've found something with the driver. Got a new shaft. I think I'm just swinging it better in general. But driving it well and not, I guess, putting myself in awkward positions off the tee, which I had been earlier in the year.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Pendrith fired a field-best, 8-under 63 that included back-to-back eagles, on Nos. 5 and 6. He led the field in strokes gained around the green for Round 3, and for the week he's top 12 off the tee, around the green and putting.\n\nPendrith has more to play for than just his first Tour trophy, too.

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPendrith shot 4-under 67 for a 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch. The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nJordan Spieth, the highest at No. 20, missed the cut for just the second time in 12 appearances at his hometown event. Defending champion Jason Day (22nd) and Tom Kim (23rd) didn't contend, with Day finishing one shot behind Kim at 9 under.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under. Knapp and Wallace were the only players in the top eight with a previous PGA Tour win.\n\nThe start of the final round was pushed back 2 1/2 hours because of overnight rain, and pairings turned into threesomes going off both tees with the players allowed to lift, clean and place shots in the fairway.\n\nWallace appeared to start a charge by chipping in for birdie at 12, the toughest hole of the week, and getting another birdie at the par-4 13th. A three-putt bogey on the par-3 15th stalled him out.\n\nRafael Campos, a 13-year journeyman from Puerto Rico who has spent most of his career on satellite tours, birdied five of the first six holes starting on the back nine to make the turn at 29.\n\nThe 36-year-old cooled off on his second nine before making a 48-foot putt from off the green for eagle on the par-5 ninth for a 63 that put him at 18 under.\n\nTaiga Semikawa, a 23-year-old from Japan playing on a sponsor exemption, also finished at 18 after a 64.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, had a rough finish as the youngest to play a final round on tour in 10 years.\n\nPlaying his final nine on the front, the son of South Korean-born former LPGA Tour player Ji-Hyun Suh had four bogeys and shot 73 to finish 6 under.\n\nKim, who is from England, played on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Just go out there and do the same as I've been doing and try not to worry about the other guys.\"\n\nThe bogey-free day, Pendrith's second-lowest PGA round, was good enough to seize the top spot over American Jake Knapp, who sank a 16-foot birdie putt at the par-5 18th hole for a bogey-free 67 to stand on 195.\n\nIt was the day's longest made putt for the 56th-ranked PGA rookie, who won his first tour title at the Mexico Open in February.\n\nEngland's Matt Wallace and American Ben Kohles shared third on 196 with Sweden's Alex Noren and American Kelly Kraft sharing fifth on 198.\n\nPendrith seeks his first PGA Tour title with his best finish so far a runner-up spot at Detroit in 2022.\n\n\"I've been in this position a few times and haven't gotten it done,\" Pendrith said. \"I think I've learned I've just got to go out there and be aggressive and keep making birdies, especially on a course like this where it yields so many birdies.\n\n\"It'll be fun. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nPendrith's eagles at the par-5 fifth and par-4 sixth lifted him into the lead at 16-under. He chipped in from 27 feet at the fifth and then chipped in from 41 yards two shots later at six.\n\n\"It was nice to see those fall,\" Pendrith said. \"The first one had a little bit of speed on the chip and hit the pin in the middle and went around the hole and dropped.\n\n\"The second one was a beautiful shot that rolled in like a putt, so nice to get off to a great start through six holes.\n\nKnapp matched him for the lead with a tap-in birdie at the fifth, two-putting from just inside 63 feet, and Kohles grabbed a share of the lead with an eagle putt at the par-5 ninth from just inside 12 feet.\n\nPendrith, ranked 107th, then sank a six-foot birdie putt at the ninth to reclaim the solo lead at the turn.\n\nA birdie putt from just inside five feet at the 12th and another from just inside 18 feet at 13 lifted Pendrith to a three-stroke lead at 19-under.\n\nKnapp dropped his approach inches from the hole at the 14th and tapped in for birdie and Kohles closed with a three-foot birdie putt as both pulled within two shots of the lead before Knapp trimmed another at 18.\n\nWallace, a four-time European Tour winner, seeks his second PGA triumph after last year's Puntacana Championship.\n\nEnglish 16-year-old amateur Kris Kim, the youngest player to make a PGA cut since 2015, fired a 70 to stand on 205.\n\n\"I realized how good my short game is, how I can rely on it sometimes, especially days like today where I sucked at hitting irons,\" Kim said. \"Made up for it with wedges.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nTaylor Pendrith, right, laughs with fellow competitor Davis Riley, left, at the second hole tee box during the third round of the Byron Nelson golf tournament in McKinney, Texas, Saturday, May 4, 2024. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don\u00b4t get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it\u00b4ll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace - a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour - answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that\u00b4s a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nTaylor Pendrith hits a tee shot on the 18th hole during the third round of the Byron Nelson golf tournament in McKinney, Texas, Saturday, May 4, 2024.

The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch.\n\n\"I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf.

Picture: ANDREW DIEB-USA TODAY SPORTS\n\nTaylor Pendrith survived a couple of sharp twists and turns on his way to securing his first career title.\n\nThe Canadian birdied the par-5 18th hole to beat Ben Kohles and win the CJ Cup Byron Nelson in a dramatic finish on Sunday at TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas.\n\n\"I felt really calm all week,\" said Pendrith, 32. \"And all today I felt really calm, too, until the end where things got a little interesting.\"\n\nPendrith posted a final-round 67 to go 23-under 261 for the week. Kohles' 66 powered him to the runner-up finish, and Swedish veteran Alex Noren placed third at 21 under after a Sunday 65.\n\nPendrith was stuck on 22 under for five straight holes, parring Nos\u200913-17, while playing partner Kohles made impressive birdies at the 16th and 17th greens to tie and then pass him for the lead.\n\nBut Kohles missed the 18th fairway and came up short of the green, landing between two bunkers. He couldn't get up onto the green on his third shot, and once he finally did, he missed a 5-foot par save. That reopened the door for Pendrith, whose lag putt from 41 feet had left him 3 feet for the winning birdie.\n\nMore than once, Pendrith described the decisive sequence of the tournament as a \"blur\" to him.\n\n\"He'd been playing so good all day,\" he said of Kohles. \"I expected him to have a putt at birdie [at No\u200918], so I was fully prepared to try and make that [eagle] putt. I didn't hit the best putt. I was a little disappointed that I left it short, but then when he missed his par putt and I realised I had a putt for the win, it was all a blur really.\n\n\"I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in.\"\n\nPendrith had experienced close calls before, notably tying for second at the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\n\"I think I learnt that I need to stay aggressive, play my own game, not worry about what others are doing and go out there and win it and not let it, I guess, be brought to you,\" Pendrith said.\n\nHe nearly suffered another setback down the stretch on Sunday. Kohles striped his approach at the par-4 16th hole, and it rolled inside 3 feet of the hole to set up the tying birdie.\n\nAt the par-3 17th, Pendrith's tee ball rolled off the false front of the green. Kohles sank a left-to-right 20-footer for birdie and the outright lead before Pendrith scrambled for an important par.\n\nKohles, a relative unknown ranked No\u2009139 in the world, had never finished better than a tie for fifth on the PGA Tour. Yet he stood at the tee of the 72nd hole Sunday with a one-shot lead.\n\n\"I felt awesome out there, even on 18,\" said Kohles, who was born in nearby Dallas and moved away at age 10. \"Of course feeling the nerves on the back nine, but that's why we play. Keep reminding myself this is what I want to do and why I want to be here. Yeah, really proud of myself all day.\"\n\nPendrith held a one-shot lead over Jake Knapp and a two-shot edge over Kohles to begin the day. Kohles turned the pressure on early by birdieing Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/02fV4Cu0ynlcZcnlKG4ZVqzPL4bnr_d7BN49SA5FVl_6tQFF0xk6T6mAXFYxwaKgtVN275_jllGQfcUDb7mSCjKAiuWxkaS_Ho_hnsJNkdLL=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It returned on Thursday, and the Richmond Hill, Ont., native is as relieved as he is excited.\n\nPendrith opened the CJ Cup Byron Nelson with a bogey-free, seven-under 64 that had him one-shot back of the lead held by Matt Wallace. His day was kick-started when he holed a 38-foot putt on the fourth hole for birdie and enjoyed the rest of the day stress-free.\n\n\"Made a long one on four and that kind of just jump started the round,\" said Pendrith. \"Played really solid. Didn't really have to scramble for par at all I don't think. Missed a couple greens but in an easy spot to chip it close, so overall great day.\"\n\nThe round is a good indication that Pendrith is getting healthy after dealing with a shoulder injury that's plagued his game for some time.\n\n\"I've been struggling with some shoulder issues all year,\" he stated. \"Actually, for a year and a half, which has been really frustrating for me. But it's starting to feel good, which is nice.\"\n\nThe shoulder ailment has robbed Pendrith of his biggest asset, which is his driver. His length off the tee has slipped and he hasn't felt comfortable trying to take a full rip at the ball as he usually does.\n\nHe's undergone some non-surgical treatments for the problem which he said is calcific tendonitis, essentially calcium balls in his rotator cuff. It's beginning to ease the pain and he's starting to show signs that his game is on the return.\n\n\"I've been driving it nice the last three weeks and had some decent finishes the last two weeks,\" he said, \"and obviously off to a decent start here. But hitting the ball nice.\"\n\nAfter starting the year with two top 10s in his first three starts, Pendrith missed the cut in five of his next six tournaments. But the last two weeks, he's posted ties for 11th. The latter one of those was alongside his long-time friend and college roommate Corey Conners last week at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.\n\n\"Mentally it's been difficult,\" admitted Pendrith. \"Getting back to kind of how I like to play golf I guess and can swing hard on the shots, so that's a good feeling.\"", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Hill,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richmond Hill, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond Hill, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tendinopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotator cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/5/2/taylor-pendrith-1-2114628-1714688412161.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPendrith shot 4-under 67 for a 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch. The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Documents give new details about deadly hit-and-run on Morrison Drive.

PGA Tour.\n\nThe Canadian is one of six among the top 10 on the leaderboard seeking a first tour victory after moving day at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson.\n\nPendrith chipped in twice for consecutive eagles to kick-start an eight-under 63 on Saturday for a one-shot advantage over second-round leader Jake Knapp.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft at the TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across

(71) is in a tie for 58th at six under overall.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022, and was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"(I will) just stay patient and play my own game, and not get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said.\n\nKnapp, who was working as a security guard three years ago, was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\n\"I do best when I do

Kohles' 66 powered him to the runner-up finish, and Swedish veteran Alex Noren placed third at 21 under after a Sunday 65.\n\nPendrith was stuck on 22 under for five straight holes, parring Nos. 13-17, while playing partner Kohles made impressive birdies at the 16th and 17th greens to tie and then pass him for the lead.\n\nBut Kohles missed the 18th fairway and came up short of the green, landing between two bunkers. He couldn't get up onto the green on his third shot, and once he finally did, he missed a 5-foot par save. That reopened the door for Pendrith, whose lag putt from 41 feet had left him 3 feet for the winning birdie.\n\nMore than once, Pendrith described the decisive sequence of the tournament as a \"blur\" to him.\n\n\"He'd been playing so good all day,\" he said of Kohles. \"I expected him to have a putt at birdie (at No. 18), so I was fully prepared to try and make that (eagle) putt. I didn't hit the best putt. I was a little disappointed that I left it short, but then when he missed his par putt and I realized I had a putt for the win, it was all a blur really.\n\n\"I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in.\"\n\nPendrith had experienced close calls before, notably tying for second at the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\n\"I think I learned that I need to stay aggressive, play my own game, not worry about what others are doing and go out there and win it and not let it, I guess, be brought to you,\" Pendrith said.\n\nHe nearly suffered another setback down the stretch Sunday. Kohles striped his approach at the par-4 16th hole, and it rolled inside 3 feet of the hole to set up the tying birdie.\n\nAt the par-3 17th, Pendrith's tee ball rolled off the false front of the green. Kohles sank a left-to-right 20-footer for birdie and the outright lead before Pendrith scrambled for an important par.\n\nKohles, a relative unknown ranked No. 139 in the world, had never finished better than a tie for fifth on the PGA Tour. Yet he stood at the tee of the 72nd hole Sunday with a one-shot lead.\n\n\"I felt awesome out there, even on 18,\" said Kohles, who was born in nearby Dallas and moved away at age 10. \"Of course feeling the nerves on the back nine, but that's why we play. Keep reminding myself this is what I want to do and why I want to be here. Yeah, really proud of myself all day.\"\n\nPendrith held a one-shot lead over Jake Knapp and a two-shot edge over Kohles to begin the day. Kohles turned the pressure on early by birdieing Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8.\n\nS.H. Kim of South Korea (64), Aaron Rai of England (64), Byeong Hun An of South Korea (65) and Matt Wallace of England (68) tied for fourth at 20 under. Knapp faded to eighth place at 19 under after posting a final-round 70.\n\nPendrith and Kohles finished 1-2 in the current Aon Swing 5. That means their recent runs of good form qualified them for next week's signature event, the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "norfolkdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Norfolk Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@norfolkdailynews.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/55/4552ddc1-2022-5c86-a503-87c06ce38f6a/66381a1005281.image.jpg?crop=1099%2C577%2C0%2C78&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPendrith shot 4-under 67 for a 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch. The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nAustin Cook (Jonesboro, Arkansas Razorbacks) posted a 64 on Sunday and finished at 16-under 268. Nico Echavarria (Razorbacks) completed the tournament at 15-under 269 after a 67 on Sunday.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nJordan Spieth, the highest at No. 20, missed the cut for just the second time in 12 appearances at his hometown event. Defending champion Jason Day (22nd) and Tom Kim (23rd) didn't contend, with Day finishing one shot behind Kim at 9 under.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under. Knapp and Wallace were the only players in the top eight with a previous PGA Tour win.\n\nThe start of the final round was pushed back 2 1/2 hours because of overnight rain, and pairings turned into threesomes going off both tees with the players allowed to lift, clean and place shots in the fairway.\n\nWallace appeared to start a charge by chipping in for birdie at 12, the toughest hole of the week, and getting another birdie at the par-4 13th. A three-putt bogey on the par-3 15th stalled him out.\n\nRafael Campos, a 13-year journeyman from Puerto Rico who has spent most of his career on satellite tours, birdied five of the first six holes starting on the back nine to make the turn at 29.\n\nThe 36-year-old cooled off on his second nine before making a 48-foot putt from off the green for eagle on the par-5 ninth for a 63 that put him at 18 under.\n\nTaiga Semikawa, a 23-year-old from Japan playing on a sponsor exemption, also finished at 18 after a 64.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, had a rough finish as the youngest to play a final round on tour in 10 years.\n\nPlaying his final nine on the front, the son of South Korean-born former LPGA Tour player Ji-Hyun Suh had four bogeys and shot 73 to finish 6 under.\n\nTaylor Pendrith reacts after sinking his putt on the 18th hole to win the Byron Nelson golf tournament in McKinney, Texas, Sunday, May 5, 2024.

After having to chip twice from the rough and already looking stunned, Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\nPendrith two-putted for birdie on the 18th, holing a 3-footer for a 4-under 67 and 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch.

He's winless on the tour.\n\nAlex Noren, the Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under.

However, second-round leader Jake Knapp is only one shot behind and will join Pendrith in the final pairing after a strong finish.\n\nHowever, there are other players lurking, and Sunday's weather forecast could bring a lot of others into contention if conditions become difficult at the normally getable course.\n\nBirdies have been plenty attainable all week, however, so perhaps someone will go low and claim a win come Sunday. And who can forget Kris Kim, the 16-year-old amateur, and how he continues to perform in his first Tour start.\n\nByron Nelson: Photos\n\nHere's what you need to know from the third round of the 2024 CJ Cup Byron Nelson:\n\nTaylor Pendrith keeping an eye on the Presidents Cup\n\nTaylor Pendrith plays a shot from a bunker on the first hole during the third round of THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA lot of players, especially the Canadians, are focused on the upcoming Presidents Cup later this summer. For Taylor Pendrith, it has been on his mind plenty, but with a poor start to the season, he knew he needed to make a move if he wanted to be on the team at Royal Montreal.\n\nThanks to back-to-back eagles Saturday at TPC Craig Ranch, Pendrith is doing a lot to make his case to captain Mike Weir that he deserves to be on the team.\n\nPendrith is the solo leader heading into Sunday's final round. He signed for an 8-under 63 on Saturday that includes consecutive eagles on Nos. 5-6, the latter coming on a 41-yard chip in from short left of the green, and he leads by one over Jake Knapp at 19 under.\n\n\"The second one, it was pretty basic pitch shot,\" Pendrith said. \"I was trying to fly it further than I did, but low, take two hops, and kind of skip up the hill. Obviously a bonus to make that, but it was a really nice shot. Would've been a foot probably if to missed. Yeah, that was a lovely shot.\"\n\nPendrith said one of the big changes in his game this week is improved driving. He recently changed shafts in his big stick, is swinging it with more confidence and for the week, he is ninth in Strokes Gained: Off the Tee.\n\n\"Just feel comfortable with everything, and now that the driver is clicking, it's a nice feeling,\" he said.\n\nPendrith remains searching for his first PGA Tour victory, looking to join fellow Canadians Corey Conners, Nick Taylor, Adam Hadwin and Adam Svensson in the winner's circle. Each of those five is in contention for the Presidents Cup team, but Pendrith can add a huge bullet point to his resume is he closes Sunday.\n\nJake Knapp's patience pays off\n\nJake Knapp walks from the second tee during the third round of THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSecond-round leader Knapp shot 4-under 67 on Saturday, a birdie on his final hole being the highlight of his day. After a poor tee shot, Knapp laid up and then hit his approach to 16 feet. He jarred the putt so sign for a bogey-free day and remain in the final group.\n\n\"I got a good caddie for that that keeps me in my lane and makes sure that I don't go and try to be too aggressive or anything like that,\" Knapp said. We kind of knew that pins were a little bit more difficult today and tough to hit it really close to, so we were going to have a lot of lower percentage birdie putts I would say. That's just kind of how it worked out. Obviously there is a percentage there where you would like to see a couple go in, but they just didn't today. Did a good job putting myself in the right spots and giving myself a bunch of chances.\"\n\nKnapp was only 2 under thru 12 when a poor tee shot on 13 put his bogey-free day in jeopardy. He hit a wedge from 77 yards out to 10 feet and stuffed the putt to continue his day, and that momentum carried over to the next hole when he made birdie. He was 2 under in his final five holes.\n\n\"You don't really want to drop one because you had one bad shot,\" he said. \"I did a good job getting it back in play and hit a good wedge shot and just trusted my green reading like I did all day, and that one just happened to go in.\"\n\nKnapp admitted Sunday he'll be watching scoreboards to follow what others are doing. He said he's at his best when he does that. The winner of the Mexico Open earlier this year said he likes knowing what everyone else is doing.\n\n\"For the most part my game plan has been the same each and every day the first three days, so just going to go and try to execute again tomorrow,\" Knapp said.\n\nBen Kohles 'still feels like a Texas at heart'\n\nBen Kohles watches his shot from the second tee during the third round of THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBen Kohles was born in Dallas. He remains a big fan of the Cowboys, Rangers, Mavericks and Stars even though he moved to North Carolina when he was 10. Although he doesn't have a memory of the Byron Nelson from his younger years, the tournaments in the Metroplex still mean a lot to him.\n\nAnd on Sunday, he has a chance to make it even more special.\n\nKohles is well in position heading into the final round after a 6-under 65 on Saturday, sitting two shots back of Pendrith at 17 under. He'll be in the penultimate pairing Sunday.\n\n\"Still feel like a Texan at heart,\" Kohles said. \"It's definitely great to come back here.\"\n\nKohles turned in 31 thanks to an eagle on the par-5 ninth, and he added two more birdies to the card, along with a bogey, on the back nine. This week, Kohles is second in Strokes Gained: Around the Green.\n\nEarlier this season, Kohles was in the final group in Puerto Rico before flaming out. What did he learn that Sunday?\n\n\"I think just not getting ahead of yourself,\" Kohles said. \"Easier said than done, but, yeah, just going through the process really. Just keep learning. I feel like that's the biggest takeaway. I always was -- just feel like I was projecting, just looking in the future too much and worrying about what's going to happen instead of just being able to stay in the present, which that's what everyone really says.\"\n\nOther chasers\n\nMatt Wallace plays a shot on the third hole during the third round of THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA birdie on the last propelled Englishman Matt Wallace into the penultimate pairing. He sits at 17 under and tied with Kohles.\n\nAlex Noren and Kelly Kraft are each at 15 under, with Noren signing for 5-under 66 on Moving Day while Kraft carded a 3-under 68.\n\nSung Kang and Kevin Tway each tied the second-low round of the day at 7-under 64, one shot behind Pendrith. Tway is T-7 and Kang T-11 after Saturday.\n\nSunday weather forecast\n\nA general view of CJ Cup signage during the third round of THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter an hour weather delay to begin the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, the tournament has proceeded without interruption. However, Sunday could be a different story.\n\nForecasts call for plenty of rain Saturday night into Sunday in the Dallas Metroplex, including the chance of some thunderstorms throughout the day Sunday. With TPC Craig Ranch already soaked, more rain could create a slogfest in the final round.\n\nWeather has affected numerous events on Tour this season. The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am was shortened to 54 holes after storms forced the cancellation of the final round.\n\nThe Cognizant Classic in The Palm Beaches and the RBC Heritage two weeks ago each had Monday finishes.\n\nHere's to hoping Mother Nature is on her best behavior Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I feel for Ben making bogey. He played so well today but (I'm) super-thrilled. It's amazing.\"\n\nKohles's bogey at 18 was not only his first of the day but the first of the day at the easiest hole on the course.\n\nHis third shot from the greenside rough hit a mound and dropped into an even worse lie and his five-footer to save par slid past, the two-shot swing giving Pendrith the win.\n\n\"Of course it stings, right?\" Kohles said. \"You feel like you had it right there and let it slip away.\"\n\nKohles said that after his first chip at 18 he faced \"a pretty screwed shot\" for his second, and he was pleased to give himself a chance to save par.\n\n\"Feel like I hit a pretty good putt,\" he said.\n\n\"Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position,\" said Kohles, who closed with a five-under 66 for 262, one stroke ahead of Sweden's Alex Noren who carded a 65.\n\nPendrith, 32, five birdies and a bogey to claim his first victory in 74 tour starts, his previous best finish a runner-up spot in Detroit in 2022.\n\nKohles, who started the day two shots back, didn't make it easy.\n\nThe 34-year-old American launched a run of three straight birdies with a 32-foot putt at the fourth hole. He rolled in a 15-footer at the fifth and an eight-footer at the sixth.\n\nPendrith, with birdies at the first and sixth -- where he holed out from a bunker -- had a one-shot lead as they arrived at the eighth, where he was unable to get up and down from a bunker and his bogey coupled with Kohles's nine-foot birdie saw Kohles take a one-stroke lead.\n\nPendrith regained the lead with birdies at the ninth and 10th, setting the stage for the tense final holes.\n\nEnglish 16-year-old amateur Kris Kim, the youngest player to make a PGA Tour cut since 2015, had his first over-par round of the week with a closing 73 to finish 65th out of 66 players to make the cut.\n\nKim admitted that fatigue was a factor on Sunday, but said the whole experience had only whetted his appetite for tournament golf.\n\n\"It's been quite a bit of adrenaline and everything,\" he said. \"It's been really good.

Pendrith shot a final round 67 to finish 23 under par.\n\n\"It doesn't feel real yet,\" he said.\n\nPendrith had blown leads heading into the final day of previous PGA Tour events in 2021 and 2022. He also overcame shoulder surgery and his game suffered while he recovered. This year, Pendrith had two Top 10 finishes. Yet, after missing the cut at the Valero Texas Open in early April, he finished tied for 11th in the Corales Puntacana Championship and Zurich Classic of New Orleans before heading to North Texas looking for that first Tour win.\n\n\"I think I learned that I need to stay aggressive, play my own game, not worry about what others are doing and go out there and win it and not let it, I guess, be brought to you,\" he said. \"So that's what I was trying to do today, stay aggressive.\"\n\nThe victory wasn't easy.\n\nKohles took a one-shot lead over Pendrith on No. 8 but lost it the next hole. The two were tied on No. 17 before Kohles took a one-shot lead after making a 19-foot birdie putt. But Kohles bogeyed the final hole allowing Pendrith an opening to drain a 2-foot birdie putt to earn the victory.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nKohles, after coming up short on a chip shot to the green, missed a par putt that would have, at worst, forced a playoff. But after Kohles made his bogey, all that was left was for Pendrith to make his putt.\n\n\"Yeah, I honestly felt like I hit a pretty good putt,\" Kohles said. \"I lacked probably a little\n\nbit of speed and I probably needed to hit it right center instead of playing it straight. Like I said, I feel like I hit a pretty good putt. So I'm not gonna hold my head. I'm just gonna take all the positives.\"\n\nDenton's Kelly Kraft (SMU) finished tied for 13th place with a final round 69, 17 under for the tournament.\n\nAaron Rai from England and South Korea's S.H. Kim emerged from a tie for 11th entering the final round to finishing tied for fourth. Both players shot seven-under 64 on Sunday.\n\nThe top five finishers entered Sunday with no PGA Tour victories and just five Top 10 finishes this year.\n\nPendrith can now claim a title and his third Top 10.\n\n\"I got off to a great start in the year with two Top 10s and missed a bunch of cuts,\" he said. \"Wasn't playing great. Mentally wasn't really having fun. And then the last couple weeks was a good prep for here I guess, and everything kind of clicked this week. I think all aspects of my game were very solid. Yeah, so it gives me tons of confidence moving forward.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nTroy Merritt, the only two-time PGA Tour winner among the top 10, shot 70 and was at 14 under with three others, including one-time winner Kevin Tway. The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nDundas, Ont., native Mackenzie Hughes, the one other Canadian to make the weekend cut, shot a 72 on the day to sit 13 shots out of the lead.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th.

After a lacklustre season plagued by injuries, he'll take a one-shot lead into the final round of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson.\n\nOn Saturday, Pendrith blistered TPC Craig Ranch with an eight-under par 63 that has him at 19 under, one shot ahead of Jake Knapp.\n\nThe round was highlighted by consecutive chip-in eagles on the fifth and sixth holes. The first was a short pitch that rattled off the pin and dropped. The second came after a 315-yard drive left him 41 yards from the flag on the par-4 hole. His shot landed on the green, skipped twice and then rolled into the hole with just enough steam.\n\n\"The second one, it was pretty basic pitch shot,\" he said. \"I was trying to fly it further than I did, but low, two hops, and kind of skip up the hill. Obviously a bonus to make that, but it was a really nice shot. Would've been a foot probably if to missed. That was a lovely shot.\"\n\nThose weren't the only times Pendrith utilized his wedge for success on Saturday. He was four for four in scrambling and also got up and down out of one greenside bunker.\n\nHis putter has also been handy and he leads the tournament in putts per green in regulation at a silky 1.52. That's been aided by him hitting it close. He needed to drain just 62 feet of putts in the third round.\n\nBut the driver has been the biggest tool in his kit for most of his career and it hasn't been performing as he wanted for much of the season. This week, he's found a groove off the tee.\n\n\"I usually drive it well and I haven't been driving it great,\" admitted Pendrith. \"The last few weeks I've found something with the driver. Got a new shaft. I think I'm just swinging it better in general. But driving it well and not, I guess, putting myself in awkward positions off the tee, which I had been earlier in the year. So just feel comfortable with everything and now that the driver is clicking, it's a nice feeling.\"\n\nThis is the third time in his career that Pendrith heads to the final round with at least a share of the lead. The two previous occasions he ended up tied for second and tied for fifth.\n\nIt's likely he'll need another low round if he wants to notch his first PGA Tour win. His 63 was the low of the day. The scores have been deep into red figures all week and on Saturday, 62 of the top 70 players broke 70.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" said Pendrith of his Sunday game plan. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nA win would do a lot for Pendrith including get him a spot into the remaining Signature events and, likely, the next three majors. And while he's currently well back in the standings, a win would also shoot him up the rankings for the Presidents Cup.\n\n\"I haven't had the best of years so far,\" he admitted, \"but it's a huge goal of mine, especially being in Canada, Mike Weir being the captain. Two years ago was awesome. To get back to that stage would be amazing and even more special to be in my home country.\"\n\nTo prepare for his Sunday round, Pendrith was planning to settle in and watch his Toronto Maple Leafs in a seventh game battle with the Boston Bruins.\n\n\"Going to go home and get some food and watch the game,\" he stated. \"Be glued to the TV. I'm a little nervous, but they looked good last game, so hopefully do as good as Game 6 and be exciting.\"", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Weir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Weir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/5/4/taylor-pendrith-1-2115390-1714851775084.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a six-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said.\n\n\"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks.\n\n\"But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPendrith shot 4-under 67 for a 23-under 261 total at the TPC Craig Ranch.

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nJordan Spieth, the highest at No. 20, missed the cut for just the second time in 12 appearances at his hometown event. Defending champion Jason Day (22nd) and Tom Kim (23rd) didn't contend, with Day finishing one shot behind Kim at 9 under.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under. Knapp and Wallace were the only players in the top eight with a previous PGA Tour win.\n\nThe start of the final round was pushed back 2 1/2 hours because of overnight rain, and pairings turned into threesomes going off both tees with the players allowed to lift, clean and place shots in the fairway.\n\nWallace appeared to start a charge by chipping in for birdie at 12, the toughest hole of the week, and getting another birdie at the par-4 13th. A three-putt bogey on the par-3 15th stalled him out.\n\nRafael Campos, a 13-year journeyman from Puerto Rico who has spent most of his career on satellite tours, birdied five of the first six holes starting on the back nine to make the turn at 29.\n\nThe 36-year-old cooled off on his second nine before making a 48-foot putt from off the green for eagle on the par-5 ninth for a 63 that put him at 18 under.\n\nTaiga Semikawa, a 23-year-old from Japan playing on a sponsor exemption, also finished at 18 after a 64.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, had a rough finish as the youngest to play a final round on tour in 10 years.\n\nPlaying his final nine on the front, the son of South Korean-born former LPGA Tour player Ji-Hyun Suh had four bogeys and shot 73 to finish 6 under.\n\nKim, who is from England, played on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire

Taylor Pendrith, currently three shots behind Knapp and +1600 at DraftKings, is a solid live bet for two reasons:\n\n1. He was in good form leading into to the tournament, which is always a positive indicator. Analyzing his recent performances and considering factors like his driving distance and accuracy, putting stats, and course suitability, Pendrith on paper could have an edge over current contenders.\n\n2.

Specifically, players are going low at TPC Craig Ranch -- Merritt shot a 62 on Friday -- and Pendrith is well-equipped to keep pace, and perhaps sail right past, the current group of leaders. Knapp is a rookie but also a winner this year. He will likely be Pendrith's biggest obstacle.\n\nAt +1600, that's a nice payout if Pendrith hits, making it an attractive proposition for bettors looking for value heading into the final 36 holes of the event.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_stracka@si.com", "name": "Jim Stracka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Merritt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Merritt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5848,h_3289,x_0,y_585/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx1s4g2ez8yv20b6hf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It's his first tour win which came in his 74th start.\n\n\"It's been something that I've been working towards my whole career,\" he said, \"and to finally get it done feels unbelievable.\"\n\nA day after watching his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs lose Game 7 of their series with the Boston Bruins, Pendrith stood on the first tee with a one-shot lead. But he was never able to get more than two strokes ahead of the chasers.\n\nPendrith made the turn in two-under par but on the back found himself missing a few key birdie opportunities and scrambling to make pars. A cadre of challengers tried to catch him, with playing partners Jake Knapp and Ben Kohles putting pressure on the leader.\n\nOn 16, Kohles caught him with a birdie and then a hole later passed him with another after rolling in a 20-foot putt. That gave him a one-shot lead to the final hole. It could have been two, but Pendrith drained a testy six-footer that circled the lip of the cup before dropping to the bottom.\n\nOn the final hole, it was Kohles' time to face the pressure. His second shot on the par-5 hole found the long grass beside the green and he chunked his third, leaving it in worse position. He was only able to pop it on to the green five feet from the cup. Pendrith, meanwhile, found the back of the green and rolled his ball down to three feet.\n\nThe finish was as stunning as it was sudden. Kohles missed and had to settle for par. Pendrith made birdie and won by a stroke.\n\n\"I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in,\" stated Pendrith. \"It managed to slip in the left. I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nThe Richmond Hill, Ont. native's win makes him the 18th Canadian to win on the PGA Tour and the second this year, joining Nick Taylor, who won the WM Phoenix Open in February. He's also the sixth different Canadian player to earn a victory in the last seven years.\n\n\"I'm not a huge golf history guy, but Byron Nelson is a special name, and for my name to be on that trophy is super special,\" he said. \"You know, it feels unbelievable, and to see some of those names on this trophy, it's crazy. I still can't believe that I'm a winner of this tournament.\"\n\nMost of Pendrith's career has been plagued by injuries. Some of them have been of the unusual sort, such as a tear in his palm. He also broke a rib during play at the Players Championship. Those have forced him to sit out for extended periods of time and stymieing what had been a burgeoning career.\n\nThe latest ailment has been a shoulder problem with a calcium ball in his rotator cuff. He's played through it while getting non-surgical treatment and only recently has the pain faded and allowed him to swing at full speed.\n\n\"It was super frustrating for a long time and just lingering, and I didn't know if it was going to feel great or bad,\" Pendrith said. \"So, yes, it's very much more rewarding dealing with all of that to come out here and feel good and know my game is good enough to win out here.\"\n\nThe win, which was worth $1.7 million (U.S.), means a lot will change for Pendrith. He will play in next week's signature event at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, N.C., and has a spot in the PGA Championship. The victory moved him to 58th on the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nHe will also now be very much on the radar for the International team at the Presidents Cup in Montreal in September. That, said Pendrith, is high on his goals for 2024. He played in the last Presidents Cup in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Taylor_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Taylor (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Hill,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richmond Hill, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond Hill, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotator cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/5/5/taylor-pendrith-1-2115813-1714957219591.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The 32-year-old outlasted a late run from PGA Tour journeyman Ben Kohles, whose hiccup on the 18th hole par-5 cost him a maiden title of his own.\n\nPendrith made a two-putt birdie on the 547-yard final hole while Kohles chunked a chip shot from less than 20 yards, making his first bogey of the day shortly after a birdie-birdie stretch to take a one-shot lead heading into 18.\n\nKohles and Pendrith have been pursuing their winning moments on the PGA Tour for over a decade, but on Sunday, it was the Ontario native's turn to hoist the trophy. Kohles, who has fought to earn a PGA Tour card three times throughout his 12-year career as a professional took solo second place at 22-under.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Pendrith said after holing his final birdie putt. \"Ben played great today, he birdied 16 and 17. I didn't hit my best iron shots down the stretch, but a good two-putt on the last. I feel for Ben, making bogey. He played so well today. But I'm super thrilled. It's amazing -- I'm shaking.\"\n\nPendrith's rounds of 64-67-63-67 to win in Texas will not only help lock up his PGA Tour status through 2026, but the performance will also guarantee him starts in the 2024 Signature events, including next week's Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hallow.\n\nThe 2024 season hasn't been all smooth sailing for Pendrith. He has played through an injured shoulder for over 15 months, since last year's Farmers Insurance Open. Pendrith was diagnosed with calcific tendinitis, a condition in the rotator cuff that causes inflammation and the formation of painful \"calcium balls\" in the shoulder. He underwent three non-surgical procedures to address the injury over the past year and a half, but so far the pain has continued to linger. Pendrith battles through the injury week-to-week and has lost club head speed due to limited mobility.\n\nBut the combination of hot putter and some recent pain-free play helped Pendrith finally reach the winner's circle on the PGA Tour. Pendrith is currently ranked 17th in strokes gained putting on Tour. He finished the 2023 season at 102nd and 2022 at 134th. The Canadian hasn't three-putted in 188 holes.\n\nPendrith turned professional in 2014 after four years at Kent State University, where he was teammates with his PGA Tour peers Corey Conners and Mackenzie Hughes.

Already in shock following two chips from the rough -- the second with his feet in a bunker -- Kohles missed a 6-foot putt that would have forced a playoff.\n\n\"Wasn't really trying to pay attention to what they were doing, although it really mattered, obviously,\" Pendrith said. \"I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch. I've been on the other side of it a couple times, and it sucks. But it's golf. It's a hard game.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The 32-year-old won in his 74th career PGA Tour start.\n\nPlaying just north of his birthplace of Dallas, Kohles shot 66 to finish a stroke back. The 34-year-old who plays out of North Carolina is winless in 68 starts.\n\n\"Honestly, hadn't seen any rough like that all week,\" said Kohles, who moved to North Carolina when he was 10. \"Just needed a little bit more umph on it. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that and try to get myself back in this position.\"\n\nAlex Noren, a Swedish player also seeking a first PGA Tour victory, was another stroke back. He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nAaron Rai and first-round leader Matt Wallace of England were at 20 under along with the South Korean pair of S.H. Kim and Byeong Hun An. Rai and Kim shot 64, An 65 and Wallace 68.\n\nPendrith, the third-round leader, and Kohles were separated by just one shot or tied most of the day. After Kohles made a 20-footer to take the lead on 17, Pendrith's par putt rolled all the way around the cup and went in.\n\n\"It just curled in, that putt on the last second there, which was unreal just to give me a chance,\" said Pendrith, who set it up with a chip from an awkward stance with his heels hanging over the lip of a bunker, after saving par with another testy putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nThe victory qualified Pendrith for the PGA Championship in two weeks and next year's Masters. He's also in the next three $20 million signature events, starting next week with the Wells Fargo championship. Kohles and Noren also played their way into Wells Fargo with their Nelson showings.\n\nWith Wells Fargo and the PGA coming in the next two weeks, just three of the top 30 in the world ranking were in the field.\n\nJordan Spieth, the highest at No. 20, missed the cut for just the second time in 12 appearances at his hometown event. Defending champion Jason Day (22nd) and Tom Kim (23rd) didn't contend, with Day finishing one shot behind Kim at 9 under.\n\nJake Knapp, the second-round leader who three years ago was working as a security guard in his home state of California, shot 70 to finish at 19 under. Knapp and Wallace were the only players in the top eight with a previous PGA Tour win.\n\nThe start of the final round was pushed back 2 1/2 hours because of overnight rain, and pairings turned into threesomes going off both tees with the players allowed to lift, clean and place shots in the fairway.\n\nWallace appeared to start a charge by chipping in for birdie at 12, the toughest hole of the week, and getting another birdie at the par-4 13th. A three-putt bogey on the par-3 15th stalled him out.\n\nRafael Campos, a 13-year journeyman from Puerto Rico who has spent most of his career on satellite tours, birdied five of the first six holes starting on the back nine to make the turn at 29.\n\nThe 36-year-old cooled off on his second nine before making a 48-foot putt from off the green for eagle on the par-5 ninth for a 63 that put him at 18 under.\n\nTaiga Semikawa, a 23-year-old from Japan playing on a sponsor exemption, also finished at 18 after a 64.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, had a rough finish as the youngest to play a final round on tour in 10 years.\n\nPlaying his final nine on the front, the son of South Korean-born former LPGA Tour player Ji-Hyun Suh had four bogeys and shot 73 to finish 6 under.\n\nKim, who is from England, played on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Ben Kohles, a 34-year-old with no career PGA Tour victories, had a golden opportunity to change his life Sunday at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson.\n\nInstead, it was Taylor Pendrith who saw his life change in the span of about 10 minutes. Pendrith, like Kohles, had never won a PGA Tour event. This was the 74th tournament for the 32-year-old.\n\nPendrith led the CJ Cup Byron Nelson after Saturday and had the lead with just three holes left to play. That's when Kohles hit some of the best shots of his career, making birdie on both 16 and 17 to wrestle the lead from Pendrith.\n\nThe two men headed to the par-5 18th hole with Kohles leading Pendrith by one shot. That was great news for Kohles, who made birdie on the 18th hole in each of his first three rounds of the tournament. A birdie on 18 would have forced Pendrith to make eagle to tie.\n\nBut Kohles didn't make a birdie. He hit his second shot just to the right of the green, in between two bunkers. That still gave him a chance to get up-and-down for birdie, but he flubbed his chip shot at the worst possible time.\n\nHe managed to get his fourth shot within five feet of the hole, which gave him a nice look at par. With Pendrith in close for birdie, Kohles just needed to make a 5-footer to send the tournament to a playoff.\n\nBut, he missed. At the worst possible time.\n\nTaylor Pendrith stepped up, made his 3-foot putt for birdie, and captured the CJ Cup Byron Nelson for his first career victory.\n\nIt's not just prize money for these guys, especially those who have never won a PGA Tour event. Pendrith now has access to many more tournaments and earned an invitation to both The Masters and the PGA Championship.\n\nFor Kohles, a guy who hasn't had much success on the PGA Tour in his career, a runner-up finish is still good. It was the best finish of his career. But winning the tournament would have been legitimately life-changing.\n\nPerhaps those thoughts ran through his head on the 18th hole.

Just makes me want to come back even more.\"\n\nbb/rcw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@reformer.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Maybe a first.\"\n\nIt was the third time on the PGA Tour this season, and vaulted him ahead of Knapp. Pendrith's lead was two before Knapp birdied the par-5 18th for a 67.\n\nBen Kohles (65) and first-round leader Matt Wallace (67) were two shots off the lead, one stroke ahead of Alex Noren and Kelly Kraft, playing near his Dallas home at the TPC Craig Ranch in the suburb of McKinney.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway shot 64, while Vince Whaley and Byeong Hun An each shot 66.\n\nWallace and Knapp, a rookie won won the Mexico Open in February, are the others with PGA Tour victories.\n\nPendrith settled for second from the top of the third-round leaderboard at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in 2022. He was in the same position at the Butterfield Bermuda Championship earlier that season before a 76 left him in a tie for fifth.\n\n\"I think just stay patient and play my own game and don't get ahead of myself,\" Pendrith said. \"Make as many birdies as you can, because I think it'll take a low one tomorrow.\"\n\nPendrith was working on a low one after a 26-foot chip shot rolled around the hole and went in, then a 41-yarder bounced about 25 feet from the hole and rolled in with almost perfect speed.\n\nThe 32-year-old who has won twice on the Canadian tour is 7 under on those two holes. They were the first two of five consecutive birdies in the second round.\n\n\"Obviously, a bonus for both of those to go in,\" Pendrith said. \"Two really good shots. First one had a little bit of steam so maybe got a little lucky to drop.\"\n\nKnapp was coming off consecutive 64s and had his second bogey-free round with a pair of birdies on each nine.\n\nThe 29-year-old Californian who was working as a security guard back home three years ago had to hang on during a rough final round for the win in Mexico. Now he'll be chasing while still playing in the final group.\n\n\"I think I do best when I kind of do leaderboard watch and I see what other guys are doing,\" Knapp said. \"You see what guys are doing in the morning and you get an idea of maybe how the course is playing.\"\n\nWallace -- a 34-year-old Englishman with 10 international victories, including four on the European tour -- answered his second bogey of the week on 16 with birdies on the final two holes.\n\n\"I don't know many people around me have won more tournaments around the world than myself,\" said Wallace, whose tour victory was in the Dominican Republic last year. \"Not that that's a big brag, but I feel like I know how to get the job done.\"\n\nKohles, who was born in Dallas but moved when he was 10, had a 263-yard second shot to 12 feet and made the eagle putt on the par-5 ninth for a 5-under 31 on the front. He bogeyed the par-4 11th before the last two of his five birdies.\n\nThe 34-year-old shot 73 playing in the final group in Puerto Rico in March, finishing fifth. Kohles has three career top-10 finishes.\n\nKris Kim, a 16-year-old amateur making his PGA Tour debut, nearly had a hole-in-one on the 225-yard fourth hole, the ball rolling within inches of the cup. The son of South Korean-born former LPGA golfer Ji-Hyun Suh shot 70 and was 8 under.\n\nKim, who is from England and playing on a sponsor exemption from the South Korean company and tournament title sponsor CJ Group, was set to become the youngest to play the final round of a PGA Tour event since Guan Tianlang at the 2014 CIMB Classic. Tianlang was 16 years, eight days old.\n\nAt 16 years, seven months, Kim surpassed Jordan Spieth as the youngest player to make the cut at the Nelson. Spieth was two months shy of his 17th birthday when made his first PGA Tour start at his hometown event in 2010, and tied for 16th. Kim was tied for 51st.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18.

He lauded the food served at the tournament, describing it as \"fabulous\" and perhaps \"the best of the year.\"\n\nSpeaking about the food served at The CJ Cup Byron Nelson 2024, Pendrith said (via Ten Golf's YouTube channel):\n\n\"The player dining was fabulous this week.

He commenced the event on Thursday, May 2, with a stellar opening round, carding 64. His bogey-free round included seven birdies, giving him a strong start at the event.\n\nStarting from the first tee hole, Pendrith secured two consecutive birdies on the fourth and fifth holes, with another birdie on the ninth. He continued his impressive play on the back nine, making four more birdies to finish with a score of 7-under 64.\n\nMoving to the second round, Pendrith faced challenges on the front nine after starting on the 10th hole. Despite two bogeys, he managed a birdie on the front nine. His performance on the back nine, though, was spectacular as he managed a birdie on the fifth and four consecutive birdies on the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth holes.\n\nFriday saw Pendrith deliver his lowest round of the tournament. A bogey-free display with four birdies and two eagles on the fifth and sixth holes, resulted in an impressive 8-under 63.\n\nIn the final round, he started the game with a birdie on the first hole, followed by five more birdies and a bogey.\n\nTaylor Pendrith has played in 12 events this season and has three top-10 finishes, having made the cut at six events.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ankita_yadav@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ankita Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/bf405-17149817555513-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "dateEnd": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 180}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 293, "textEnd": 298}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1338, "textEnd": 1343}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He failed to capitalize on his length on TPC Craig Ranch's drivable par-4 14th and missed a mid-range birdie putt on the difficult par-3 15th.\n\nHe held the lead from the jump on Sunday, but it was just one shot before Ben Kohles birdied 16 and 17 to pass him heading to the par-5 18th.\n\nPendrith himself needed to hole a seven-footer for par on the 17th after Kohles drained a 20-footer before him. It looped around the hole before falling in the cup.\n\nThe 32-year-old then put his ball on the par-5 18th in two and watched as Kohles chunked a pitch from short of the green and then missed his par putt to drop back to 22 under.\n\nAll Pendrith had to do was make his three-footer for birdie, which he did to win the CJ Cup Byron Nelson by one.\n\nIt's Pendrith's first PGA Tour win coming in his third season since earning his card on the Korn Ferry Tour. His last professional win came five years ago on the PGA Tour Canada.\n\nPendrith played in his 2022 rookie season, holding the outright 54-hole lead at the Bermuda Championship and later a share of the 54-hole lead at the Rocket Mortgage Classic, both times leading to top-5s. His nine top-25s propelled him to a BMW Championship appearance to end his season and then a selection to the International Presidents Cup team.\n\nBut Pendrith performed poorly at Quail Hollow, losing all four of his matches as the U.S. again took the Presidents Cup. While he posted four top-10s the next season in 2023, he also missed 12 cuts, more than double his total from his rookie year.\n\nHis 2024 season was similarly a case of Jekyll and Hyde as he had missed more cuts than he had made coming into this week at TPC Craig Ranch. But, in his five missed cuts, he'd only finished outside the top 11 once.\n\nHe got off to a fast start this week outside of Dallas, starting the weekend in a tie for fifth before making back-to-back eagles on the front nine of what ended up being a third-round 63 to grab the lead by one.\n\nOn Sunday, he started the day by stuffing his approach at the 1st, leading to a birdie and then holed a bunker shot on No. 6 to stay one ahead of Kohles.\n\nKohles, the reining Korn Ferry Tour Player of the Year, briefly grabbed the lead on his own on No. 8 before Pendrith grabbed a share once again on the 9th and didn't give it up until Kohles' back-to-back birdies on 16 and 17.\n\nPendrith spun his approach off the front of the 17th green, settling just in the edge of the rough, near the front bunker, impacting his stance. Preferred lies were in effect for the fourth straight day due to heavy rains overnight, but PGA Tour official Ken Tackett ruled none of Pendrith's ball was touching the fairway, denying him relief. He managed to scoot his ball on the green and watched the putt circle the hole completely before it dropped.\n\nOn 18, the Canadian's second with an iron found the green 40 feet away after Kohles' hybrid came up short in the rough. Facing a similarly difficult stance to what Pendrith had on the previous hole, Kohles chunked his third and then missed the par attempt from five feet to give Pendrith the win.\n\nPendrith is the sixth different Canadian to win on the PGA Tour the past two seasons and one of his fellow Cannuck winners, Mackenzie Hughes, was one of the first players to greet him on 18 green.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Championship_(PGA_Tour)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW Championship (PGA Tour)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mackenzie Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TaylorPendrithCJCup.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He made birdie on 16 and 17 to go from one back to lead by a shot.\n\nIt appeared as though Pendrith was going to let his 54-hole lead slip away for the third time in his professional career, handing Kohles the maiden victory.\n\nThen the par-5 18th played out.\n\nKohles chunked his third shot from the rough just off the green, failing to reach the putting surface.\n\nIt sadly left some fans calling it a massive choke job.\n\nMeanwhile, Pendrith hit two great shots, setting up a lengthy eagle putt. Despite missing the eagle-3, he left himself with four feet for birdie and 23-under par.\n\nKohles hit a great second chip, but inexplicably missed his three-foot par putt. It was gut-wrenching to watch.\n\nPendrith then calmly drained his birdie for his first ever win on the PGA Tour in 74 tries.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Pendrith told Amanda Balionis of CBS Sports. \"Ben played great today and birdied 16 and 17. I didn't hit my best iron shots down the stretch, but a good two-putt on the last was -- I feel for Ben making bogey; he played so well today. I'm super thrilled. It's amazing. I'm shaking.\"\n\nThe Canadian had a rough season entering the week. He had recorded just two Top 10's and four Top 25's with six missed cuts, including five in his last eight starts.\n\nYet, Pendrith fired off the low round of the day Saturday with an 8-under 63. That elevated him atop the leaderboard heading into the final round of play.\n\nHe started with a birdie on the first and added another at the par-4 6th. The 32-year-old dropped a shot on 8 but birdied the 9th to turn in 34 strokes.\n\nPendrith kept it clean on the back nine, adding a birdie at the 12th before he made five straight pars until the final hole.\n\nHowever, it was his par saves on 16 and 17 that proved to be crucial. He sank a couple of very tricky par putts that could very easily have ended his chances.\n\n\"I had a jumper on 16, and that first putt - I thought if I played it too high, it wouldn't come back, so that was a huge save,\" Pendrith said. \"On 17, I hit a really good shot, and it spun off the front. I had an awkward stance, but I curled in that putt the last second there, which was unreal, to give me a chance. Obviously, a really good birdie on the last for me.\"\n\nWith this victory, Pendrith moved all the way up to 34th in the FedEx Cup standings.

And all today I felt really calm, too, until the end where things got a little interesting,\" said Pendrith, 32.\n\nHe posted a final-round 67 to go 23-under 261 for the week. Kohles' 66 powered him to the runner-up finish, and Swedish veteran Alex Noren placed third at 21 under after a final-round 65.\n\nPendrith was stuck on 22 under for five straight holes, parring Nos. 13-17, while playing partner Kohles made impressive birdies at the 16th and 17th greens to tie and then pass him for the lead.\n\nHowever, Kohles missed the 18th fairway and came up short of the green, landing between two bunkers. He couldn't get up onto the green on his third shot, and once he finally did, he missed a five-foot par save. That reopened the door for Pendrith, whose lag putt from 41 feet had left him 3 feet for the winning birdie.\n\nMore than once, Pendrith described the decisive sequence of the tournament as a \"blur\" to him.\n\n\"He'd been playing so good all day. I expected him to have a putt at birdie (at No. 18), so I was fully prepared to try and make that (eagle) putt,\" he said of Kohles.\n\n\"I didn't hit the best putt. I was a little disappointed that I left it short, but then when he missed his par putt and I realised I had a putt for the win, it was all a blur really. I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in.\"\n\nPendrith had experienced close calls before, notably tying for second at the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\n\"I learnt that I need to stay aggressive, play my own game, not worry about what others are doing and go out there and win it and not let it, I guess, be brought to you,\" he said.\n\nKim Seong-hyeon of South Korea (64), Englishman Aaron Rai (64), South Korea's An Byeong-hun (65) and Matt Wallace of England (68) tied for fourth at 20 under. American Jake Knapp faded to eighth place at 19 under after posting a final-round 70.\n\nPendrith and Kohles, a relative unknown ranked No. 139 in the world, finished 1-2 in the current Aon Swing 5. That means their recent runs of good form qualified them for this week's signature event, the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\n\"I felt awesome out there, even on 18,\" said Kohles, who was born in nearby Dallas and moved away at age 10.\n\n\"Of course feeling the nerves on the back nine, but that's why we play. Keep reminding myself this is what I want to do and why I want to be here. Yeah, really proud of myself all day.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is not in the field for the US$20 million (S$27 million) event in Charlotte, as his wife Meredith is expected to go into labour with the couple's first child.

The Dallas native had yet to yield a bogey during the final round before playing Sunday's easiest hole.\n\nIt started well enough, driving into the left rough before landing the second shot between two front-right greenside bunkers and staying in the long stuff. But needing an up-and-down birdie, it took two tries to get out of the rough. The fourth landed five feet from the hole, but Kohles blew the par putt.\n\nREAD MORE: Andrew Johnston blasts 'mad' PGA Tour over loyalty bonuses going to Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods puts PGA Championship plan into place after confirming schedule plans\n\nBurning the edge allowed Pendrith to retake the lead with a birdie, and instead, it was the Canadian taking his first PGA Tour title in his 74th start. The two-time PGA Tour Canada winner acknowledged the unexpected nature of the ending afterwards.\n\n\"It was wild,\" he said at the press conference. \"I hit a really nice shot in there 35 feet, probably for eagle, and Ben was in a little bit of a tricky spot. He'd been playing so good all day. I expected him to have a putt at birdie, so I was fully prepared to try and make that putt.\n\n\"I didn't hit the best putt.

He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch, birdieing 16 and 17.\n\n\"I've been on the other side of it a couple of times, and it sucks, but it's golf. It's a hard game. Obviously, I'm thrilled to birdie the last and get it done. But feel for him.\"\n\nKohles remained relatively upbeat afterwards despite the disappointment while recalling what went wrong with the third shot. \"It was sitting up a little bit,\" he said, \"but honestly hadn't seen any rough like that all week.\n\n\"Yeah, just didn't hit a great shot. Just needed a little bit more oomph on it. I kind of maybe decelerated a little bit, but you live, and you learn. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that.\n\nHe continued: \"After that first chip, I was in a pretty screwed shot this second chip.

He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18.

The 34-year-old has just one career top-ten on the PGA Tour an has been a journeyman for much of his career.\n\nThat was all set to change when Kohles came to the par 5 18th and final hole of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson at TPC Craig Ranch in suburban Dallas with a one-shot lead.\n\nNo one had made a bogey all day at the hole. Taylor Pendrith, who was in Kohles' group, was one shot back, but a par essentially guaranteed him a playoff, and that's if Pendrith made a birdie!\n\nInstead, disaster stuck. Ben Kohles made a bogey 6, while Pendrith made a birdie 4, and Pendrith won the event by a stroke.\n\nKohles drove his tee shot into the left rough, but hit a pretty good second shot over water to get into the green side rough. An up and down is a birdie, and even if he doesn't get up-and-down, he should still make par.\n\nInstead, he hit a truly terrible chip, catching it fat and dumping it in the bunker. Still, par is very much in play!\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Pendrith had split the fairway with his tee shot, found the green with his second, and lagged it up close for a routine birdie 4. The pressure was on Kohles.\n\nKohles hit a solid bunker shot and had this five-footer to send the tournament to a playoff.\n\nOh, no. You hate to see that, truly. First place was worth $1,7 million, which would've more-than doubled Kohles' career earnings on the PGA Tour. Granted, second place is just over $1 million, so he's not exactly going home empty-handed.\n\nBut, winning a PGA Tour event comes with a ton of perks. The winner gets a two-year extension on their Tour card, an invite to the next Masters and PGA Championship, entry into all of the Tour's signature events, as well as a trip to Hawaii for The Sentry, which kicks off the new year.\n\nUltimately, it's a tragedy for Ben Kohles.

The spotlight now shines on Canadian golfer Taylor Pendrith, as he seeks his first career victory on the American circuit at the age of 32.\n\nA stunning round of -8 propelled him to the top of the leaderboard with an overall score of -19. Pendrith's performance included back-to-back eagles on the 5th and 6th holes, along with four birdies.\n\nBehind him, American Jake Knapp, yesterday's leader, sits alone in second place at -18 after a solid round of -4 on moving day.\n\nFollowing closely are the duo of Ben Kohles from the USA and England's Matt Wallace, both at -17. Further back at -15 are Sweden's Alex Noren and another American, Kelly Kraft. The group of seventh-placed players, predominantly Americans, including Kevin Tway, Vince Whaley, and Troy Merritt, are at -14 alongside South Korean Byeong Hun An.\n\nIt's worth noting that a victory for Pendrith would significantly boost his chances in the Olympic race.

In 2015, he primarily competed on the PGA Tour Canada, securing three runner-up finishes and a third-place finish in the Order of Merit, which earned him a spot on the Web.com Tour.\n\nAlthough he managed a tied fourth-place finish in the Club Colombia Championship, his sole top-10 finish of the season, he struggled with 14 missed cuts. From 2017 to 2019, Pendrith focused on the Canadian Tour, experiencing limited success in the earlier years.\n\nHowever, in 2019, he emerged as a contender, finishing as the runner-up in the Osprey Valley Open and then securing victories at the 1932byBateman Open and Mackenzie Investments Open. His strong performances placed him second in the Order of Merit and granted him a spot on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nOn the 2020 Korn Ferry Tour, Pendrith continued to impress, securing runner-up finishes in three consecutive tournaments in July and another at the Wichita Open in September. His consistent play earned him a spot at the 2020 U.S.\n\nOpen, where he finished tied for 23rd place. Following his success on the Korn Ferry Tour, Pendrith earned a promotion to the PGA Tour at the conclusion of the 2020-21 season. In July 2022, Pendrith achieved his best finish yet on the PGA Tour, securing a T2 at the 2022 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nLater that year, in September 2022, Pendrith was selected to represent the International team in the 2022 Presidents Cup.

He wowed the crowd on the stadium hole at the par-3 17th with a tee shot to 2 1/2 feet, but followed that birdie with a par knowing he probably needed an eagle on 18. Noren shot 65 and was alone in third at 21 under.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mandatory Credit: Andrew Dieb-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe PGA Tour recently wrapped up another successful event, the CJ Cup at Byron Nelson, where Taylor Pendrith triumphed with a remarkable score of 23 under par. Following this victory, his caddie, Mitchell Theoret, opened up about his relationship with the Canadian professional golfer.\n\nTheoret first shared that he and the golfer are best friends, having known each other since they were 9 years old. Later, with emotional tears, the bagman expressed his joy over the golfer's first PGA Tour victory. He detailed how, despite facing injuries, Pendrith never gave up but continued to persevere and stick to his efforts.\n\nPGA Tour took to X to share the video clip of the caddie's emotional revelation:\n\nThe 32-year-old golfer had an incredible form since day one of the tournament. He had a bogey-free first round that saw him end the day at 7 under par. Meanwhile, his second round made him suffer with two bogeys on the back nine as he secured six birdies to settle at 4 under par.\n\nPendrith delivered an exceptional performance on the third day, highlighted by back-to-back eagles on the 5th and 6th holes, along with four additional birdies. This made him finish the round at 8 under par. The golfer's last round saw him record five birdies against one bogey to conclude at 4 under par. With these impressive scores, he triumphed over Ben Kohles with a single-stroke margin at the TPC Craig Ranch.\n\nPendrith's victory at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson earned him a substantial purse of $1,710,000.00 from the $9,500,000 prize pool, along with 500 FedEx Cup points. Furthermore, this triumph secured him his PGA Tour status through 2026. But the rewards didn't stop there! He also received some remarkable exemptions as a result of this win.\n\nTaylor Pendrith's recent victory was particularly momentous as it marked his maiden PGA Tour win. This achievement became even more special because it also granted him exemptions to participate in the remaining signature events of the 2024 season. This includes the Wells Fargo Championship, the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday, and the Travelers Championship.\n\nMoreover, he will also be competing in the upcoming PGA Championship, scheduled to kick off on May 16. As for the 2025 seasons, Pendrith got an exemption in The Sentry, The Players Championship, and The Masters tournament.\n\nWith these many spots guaranteed to the golfer, it would be interesting to see if Pendrith can perform to his full potential and whether or not he can win any of these significant events.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alisha_kotadia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Alisha Kotadia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/0bfc3795-untitled-design-31.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 2402, "textEnd": 2408}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The Dallas native had yet to yield a bogey during the final round before playing Sunday's easiest hole.\n\nIt started well enough, driving into the left rough before landing the second shot between two front-right greenside bunkers and staying in the long stuff. But needing an up-and-down birdie, it took two tries to get out of the rough. The fourth landed five feet from the hole, but Kohles blew the par putt.\n\nREAD MORE: Andrew Johnston blasts 'mad' PGA Tour over loyalty bonuses going to Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods puts PGA Championship plan into place after confirming schedule plans\n\nBurning the edge allowed Pendrith to retake the lead with a birdie, and instead, it was the Canadian taking his first PGA Tour title in his 74th start. The two-time PGA Tour Canada winner acknowledged the unexpected nature of the ending afterwards.\n\n\"It was wild,\" he said at the press conference. \"I hit a really nice shot in there 35 feet, probably for eagle, and Ben was in a little bit of a tricky spot. He'd been playing so good all day. I expected him to have a putt at birdie, so I was fully prepared to try and make that putt.\n\n\"I didn't hit the best putt. I was a little disappointed that I left it short.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"But then, when he missed his par putt, and I realized I had a putt for the win, it was all a blur, really.\" Pendrith later added: \"But, yeah, I feel for Ben. He played really, really good today, especially down the stretch, birdieing 16 and 17.\n\n\"I've been on the other side of it a couple of times, and it sucks, but it's golf. It's a hard game. Obviously, I'm thrilled to birdie the last and get it done. But feel for him.\"\n\nKohles remained relatively upbeat afterwards despite the disappointment while recalling what went wrong with the third shot. \"It was sitting up a little bit,\" he said, \"but honestly hadn't seen any rough like that all week.\n\n\"Yeah, just didn't hit a great shot. Just needed a little bit more oomph on it. I kind of maybe decelerated a little bit, but you live, and you learn. Did so many good things this week, and I'm just going to keep reminding myself of that.\n\nHe continued: \"After that first chip, I was in a pretty screwed shot this second chip. Felt like I hit a really good shot there. Yeah, feel like I hit a pretty good putt.\n\n\"Lacked probably a little bit of speed, and I probably needed to start it right centre instead of playing it straight. Like I said, I feel like I hit a good putt, so I'm not going to hold my head on that.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_abbott@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Matthew Abbott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnston_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Johnston (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32745196.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2151619413.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The tournament had $9.5 million available for those who made the cut, with the winner landing a payday of $1.71 million.\n\nThat winner ended up being Taylor Pendrith. He staged a furious comeback, shooting two five under par in round four. It was just enough to grab the win from Ben Kohles, who led going into the 18th hole.\n\nIt was a hotly contested final round and early on in round four, 10 different golfers were in play for the lead. Through 10 holes, there was a tie and several others close behind.\n\nWhile many golfers had already finished, Alex Noren, Aaron Rai, SH Kim, Ben Kohles, and Taylor Pendrith were within two strokes of one another, but Pendrith prevailed.\n\nJake Knapp fell short of second PGA Tour win at CJ Cup Byron Nelson\n\nJake Knapp delivered three impressive rounds, positioning himself favorably for a shot at claiming his second PGA Tour victory. His initial triumph occurred earlier this year at the 2024 Mexico Open held at Vidanta.\n\nAlthough Knapp maintained a solid performance in the final round, the competition surged ahead with exceptional play. According to SB Nation, Knapp praised the quality of the greens, describing them as \"pure\". He and his coaching team had previously discussed their success in adapting to the rainy conditions, which seemed to work in his favor on the course.\n\nThe golfer has had some up-and-down performances with the putter of late. Even though he felt as if the swing was the same, the results just weren't:\n\n\"Early on in the year, felt like I was putting well, and for the last month or so, the stroke felt the same, and the ball wasn't going in the hole,\" he said. \"So just put a little bit more of a premium the last couple weeks on green reading. Yeah, nice to see a few more going in.\"\n\nSo even though it did not yield an ultimate victory and the second of his budding PGA Tour career, it was a positive outing for the golfer. Though Knapp technically holds just one win, he showed that he's not just a one-hit wonder and should remain competitive in the future.\n\nConsidering he was working as a bouncer at clubs just a few years ago, a placement of eighth like the one he got this weekend proves that he has a place in the modern sport.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexican Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/344bf-17149477025233-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Kim and Byeong Hun An, and three adrift of Pendrith.\n\nWallace was one over after seven holes on Sunday but a run of four birdies in five holes between nine and 13, including a chip-in from off the green at 12, shot him back up the leaderboard after he began his round on 17 under, two strokes behind 54-hole leader Pendrith.\n\nPendrith and Kohles traded the lead during the final round but it was Kohles who had the advantage heading to the last with successive birdies at 16 and 17 propelling him one stroke clear of his rival at 23 under.\n\nBut Canadian Pendrith went on to birdie 18 and American Kohles suffered a bogey after missing a five-foot par save as the players' scores flipped, with Alex Noren taking third place on 21 under.\n\nThe victory was Pendrith's first on the PGA Tour after two previous successes on the PGA Tour Canada and left Kohles still waiting for his first triumph on the circuit after four on the Korn Ferry Tour, including two last year.\n\nThe headline-maker of the week was 16-year-old English amateur Kris Kim, who became the youngest player to make the cut in a PGA Tour event since 2015 after being given a spot in the tournament courtesy of a sponsor's invite.\n\nKim, who was inches away from a hole-in-one on Saturday, shot under par in each of his first three rounds, peaking with a four-under 67 on day two.\n\nHe carded a two-over 73 on Sunday as a four-bogey back nine dropped him back to six under for the tournament but he can reflect on a stellar week - before his English GCSE exam next Thursday.\n\nKim said: \"I've learnt so much this week and had so much fun, I just realised how big it is and how fun it is to play golf on tour.\n\n\"I think stamina-wise I've got to get better, I just felt so tired on that final 18 holes.

After Kohles made an astounding bogey at the last, though, Pendrith flipped the script, made a 4 and got his first PGA Tour victory. Grade: A+\n\nHere are the grades for the rest of the notables on the leaderboard at the 2024 CJ Cup Byron Nelson\n\nT11. Si Woo Kim (-17): My guy Si Woo stays hot with another solid performance. He has not missed a cut this year, and if you look at the three non-putting strokes gained categories, he's been positive in each category for every event he's played starting with the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March except for his approach play at the Masters. That's the only time he was worse than average in any single category at any individual event. That's crazy! Grade: B+\n\nT30. Nick Dunlap (-14): The American Express winner has struggled mightily since winning nearly four. months ago. He has played just one tournament in which he was positive both off the tee and with his iron play. Coming into this week, he has only one (one!) top 40 finish since winning in Palm Springs in January and turning pro. It has been an eye-opening experience for somebody who I'm still extremely excited about in the long term. Dunlap is barely 20 years old and simply struggling with the ebbs and flows of pro golf. This week must be an encouragement for him as its his second decent finish in his last four starts (he also finished T11 in Houston before the Masters). Grade: C+\n\nMC. Jordan Spieth (-4): I will hit the panic button if you will. After a nice start to the year, here's what Spieth's last eight tournaments look like.\n\nWhew, that's bad. And while players like Spieth can almost always find something faster than it seems like they should be able to, there are so many different holes to plug. Here's an example: On Thursday in the first round at TPC Craig Ranch, Spieth hit it good but finished 113th in putting. On Friday in the second round, he led the field in driving (what?) but finished 154th in approach play (out of 155 golfers). It's not just one thing with him. It's so many different things all the time and all at once. Winning the PGA Championship to complete the grand slam has never looked further away.

The Canadian golfer Ben Kohles in Texas to take his maiden PGA Tour title. While the result was special, the 32-year-old revealed that his injury woes made the victory 'more satisfying.'\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Pendrith suffered calcific tendonitis in his left shoulder back in January 2023 at the Farmers Insurance Open. The golfer underwent three different nonsurgical procedures to address the issue. He opted against surgery and decided to go for the longer recovery route.\n\nNow, the golfer finally seems happy with his shoulder and he voiced the same during The CJ Cup Byron Nelson winner's press conference. Pendrith noted that he got a 'huge' boost since it got resolved. He added that it gave him \"tons of confidence\" to see all aspects of his game get solid.\n\nSpeaking in the presser at TPC Craig Ranch, Taylor Pendrith said (at 9:30):\n\n\"It's huge. I feel like my game has been close the last few weeks starting to feel better physically after a long time... It's been a grind for the last little bit. I got off to a good start in the year with two top 10s and then missed a bunch of cuts, wasn't playing great, mentally wasn't really having fun and then the last couple weeks was a good prep for here I guess and everything kind of clicked this week. I think I did all aspects of my game were very solid. So, it gives me tons of confidence.\"\n\nReplying to a query on whether overcoming the injuries made the win \"a little bit more satisfying,\" Taylor Pendrith said (at 10:39):\n\n\"Totally. I've had three different procedures to try and fix this pain that I've been dealing with. And the last one was the week of the waste management. I feel like the last couple of weeks have really started feeling better. It was super frustrating for a long time... So, it's very much more rewarding dealing with all of that to come out here and feel good. And my game is good enough to win out here.\"\n\nTaylor Pendrith targets the Presidents Cup team\n\nTaylor Pendrith seemed confident about his fitness coming into The CJ Cup Byron Nelson 2024. Earlier on Thursday, the Canadian golfer stated that he had started to feel better in recent weeks. He noted that his results showed the improvement as well. However, his target was bigger than just winning this week.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Pendrith arrived in Dallas with back-to-back T11 finishes at the Corales Puntacana Championship and the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Coming into this week's competition, the PGA Tour star made his ambitions clear to regain his spot on the Presidents Cup team.\n\nTaylor Pendrith, who made his International Team debut in 2022 at Quail Hollow, sat No.26 on the team list.

Canadian Taylor Pendrith claimed his maiden PGA Tour title by a single stroke from Ben Kohles of the US with a final round 67 giving him a winning 23-under total.\n\nJapanese rising star Semikawa, competing on a sponsor's exemption, also impressed with a second 64 of the week which propelled him to a share of ninth place on 18-under. Compatriot Ryo Hisatsune (64) and Si Woo Kim of Korea (67) were a further stroke back in tied 13th place.\n\nAn traded seven birdies against a lone bogey as he put on another impressive finish despite playing with a sore wrist. \"I was short by only a few shots, but I gave it my all. Despite not being at 100 percent, I managed to play consistently, which I'm happy about,\" said An.\n\n\"I'm especially satisfied with my performance in the latter half of the tournament. I created some opportunities. I hope to maintain this momentum next week (Wells Fargo Championship). My wrist is feeling good at the moment. I was struggling at Harbor Town last week, but it's much better now.\"\n\nSH Kim, featuring in his second season on the PGA Tour, was finally able to crack a smile and after achieving his best result of the season so far. The highlight of his day came with an eagle on the par-5 18th hole as he executed a precise second shot that landed 12 feet from the pin.\n\n\"I had a good start on the first hole. There was quite a gap with the leader, so I just wanted to maintain my game. Overall, I'm happy and satisfied,\" said Kim, who made birdies on Hole Nos. 1, 6, 9, 10, 14 and 17, all from within eight feet.\n\n\"I struggled with my iron shots and putting for a while, but I saw improvement in this event. My putting wasn't too bad, although I experienced some ups and downs.\n\n\"This week, I felt confident reading the greens. I'm happy with this result and feel confident now. I know I still have a long way to go, but this week has set the tone for the rest of my season,\" he added.\n\nLike An and Kim, Semikawa also made a late surge up the leaderboard, picking up five strokes in his last five holes, which included a chip-in eagle on the sixth hole after starting his day from the 10th tee. The 23-year-old, who is a four-time Japan Golf Tour winner, earned a spot in the Myrtle Beach with his top-10 finish.\n\n\"A 7-under round with two bogeys, so it's hard to be too disappointed. I was pleased to birdie No. 5, and on the sixth, I focused on getting my second shot close to give myself a birdie opportunity. Luckily, it hit the pin and dropped in (for eagle). No. 7 was challenging, so securing a birdie there felt good,\" said Semikawa, who is a former world No. 1 amateur.\n\nPendrith, 32, made history as the first Canadian to win The CJ Cup Byron Nelson, securing a victory with a composed birdie on the final hole, one ahead of Kohles who had led made a bogey. \"I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in. It managed to slip in the left.

Canadian Taylor Pendrith claimed his maiden PGA Tour title by a single stroke from Ben Kohles of the U.S. with a final-round 67 giving him a winning 23-under total.\n\nJapanese rising star Semikawa, competing on a sponsor's exemption, also impressed with a second 64 of the week which propelled him to shared ninth place on 18-under. Compatriot Ryo Hisatsune (64) and Kim Si-woo of Korea (67) were a further stroke back in tied 13th place.\n\nAn traded seven birdies against a lone bogey as he put on another impressive finish despite playing with a sore wrist. \"I was short by only a few shots, but I gave it my all. Despite not being at 100 percent, I managed to play consistently, which I'm happy about,\" said An. \"I'm especially satisfied with my performance in the latter half of the tournament. I created some opportunities. I hope to maintain this momentum next week (Wells Fargo Championship). My wrist is feeling good at the moment. I was struggling at Harbor Town last week, but it's much better now.\"\n\nKim Seong-hyeon, featuring in his second season on the PGA Tour, was finally able to crack a smile after achieving his best result of the season so far. The highlight of his day came with an eagle on the par-5 18th hole as he executed a precise second shot that landed 12 feet from the pin.\n\n\"I had a good start on the first hole. There was quite a gap with the leader, so I just wanted to maintain my game. Overall, I'm happy and satisfied,\" said Kim, who made birdies on Hole Nos. 1, 6, 9, 10, 14 and 17, all from within eight feet.\n\n\"I struggled with my iron shots and putting for a while, but I saw improvement in this event. My putting wasn't too bad, although I experienced some ups and downs. This week, I felt confident reading the greens. I'm happy with this result and feel confident now. I know I still have a long way to go, but this week has set the tone for the rest of my season,\" he added.\n\nLike An and Kim, Semikawa also made a late surge up the leaderboard, picking up five strokes in his last five holes, which included a chip-in eagle on the sixth hole after starting his day from the 10th tee. The 23-year-old, a four-time Japan Golf Tour winner, earned a spot in the Myrtle Beach with his top-10 finish.\n\n\"A seven-under round with two bogeys, so it's hard to be too disappointed. I was pleased to birdie No. 5, and on the sixth, I focused on getting my second shot close to give myself a birdie opportunity. Luckily, it hit the pin and dropped in (for eagle). No. 7 was challenging, so securing a birdie there felt good,\" said Semikawa, a former world No. 1 amateur.\n\nPendrith, 32, made history as the first Canadian to win The CJ Cup Byron Nelson, securing a victory with a composed birdie on the final hole, one ahead of Kohles who had led made a bogey.\n\n\"I've never had a putt to win a PGA Tour event, so my caddie said this is the straightest putt we've had all year and just knock it in. It managed to slip in the left. I'm pretty happy,\" said Pendrith.\n\nBY CHUAH CHOO CHIANG [kjdsports@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Seong-hyeon_(golfer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kim Seong-hyeon (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Byeong-hun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "An Byeong-hun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Si-woo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Si-woo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Golf_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan Golf Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/05/06/056e19ba-a202-4970-a174-eb4f549acc11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

This is something that is becoming a trend in the signature-event era of the PGA Tour.\n\nOn the other side of the planet in Singapore, Brooks Koepka found the winner's circle over on LIV Golf. Not only does the victory show that he's in form two weeks out from his PGA Championship defense, but it's a reminder that he still very much has the ability to win golf tournaments that aren't major championships.\n\nWinning golf tournaments and Jordan Spieth, on the other hand, do not co-exist at the moment. After another missed cut at what was a home game for him at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, we've got to continue asking the question: what the hell is going on with Spieth?\n\nTaylor Pendrith, the long-hitting Canadian, earned PGA Tour victory numero uno at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson with a birdie on the last. Ben Kohles all but gift-wrapped the win for Pendrith after becoming the only player in the entire field to bogey the 18th hole on Sunday, but Pendrith does deserve credit for making a birdie on the 72nd hole to win by one shot and avoid a playoff.\n\nOn the surface, a player making birdie on the final hole and his counterpart unfortunately suffering a choke session to close things out sounds interesting. But when that scenario unfolds between two players only diehard golf fans have ever heard of on an incredibly forgettable golf course, the nerves and drama simply aren't there.\n\nKohles making bogey was the latest reminder that winning on the PGA Tour is insanely hard and kudos to Pendrith for getting the job done, but those two things don't equate to exciting golf.\n\nThis is what is to be expected, however, when we're in this age of signature events on Tour combined with some of the game's biggest stars playing over on LIV.\n\nJust look at the first page of this week's leaderboard:\n\nEven when signature events and LIV Golf weren't part of the equation, we would get leaderboards like this, but now that we've got an entirely different tour playing all over the world and the PGA Tour itself only incentivizing top players to play in signature events, major championships, and the FedEx Cup playoffs, these 'off' weeks are feeling more off than ever before.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that there is no way to fix it given the current state of professional golf. The path to success for the PGA Tour is praying its biggest stars contend in signature events, major championships continue to do as they've always done and deliver the goods, and then hope golf fans have enough stamina to pretend to care about the playoffs at the end of the year.\n\nSpeaking of the PGA Tour praying, it's safe to say it was hoping to see Jordan Spieth play the weekend at TPC Craig Ranch, but that wasn't in the cards after an underwhelming 70 on Friday en route to an early trunk slam.\n\nSpieth's 2024 campaign has been interesting, but not in a good way. After opening the year with a solo third at The Sentry, a T-6 in Phoenix, and then bizarrely signing for the wrong number at The Genesis to get disqualified, things have gone downhill in a hurry.\n\nSpieth has made 11 starts this season and missed five cuts, with four of them coming over the course of his last six events. His missed cut at the Masters was a bit of a head scratcher, as was his T-39 at the RBC Heritage, but you add a missed cut at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson and the cause for concern has officially hit an all-time high for Spieth.\n\nIt's unbelievable that this is a true statement, but Jordan Spieth has won just two golf tournaments since July 2017 when he hoisted the Claret Jug. Anyone who would have predicted that after his win at The Open would have been laughed at, but here we are.\n\nWhether it be a potentially lingering wrist injury, simple burnout, or needing a change of scenery with caddie Michael Greller, something has got to give here.\n\nHmm, would you look at that? Brooks Koepka is trending in the right direction less than two weeks away from the opening round of the PGA Championship.\n\nAfter essentially no-showing at the Masters and showing very real signs of frustration over the last month, some began questioning whether Koepka was in a good spot heading into the year's second major championship. Well, a two-shot win in Singapore answered those questions as he very clearly found something, especially with his putter, en route to his fourth win on LIV Golf.\n\nFour is a significant number for Koepka as that is the same number of regular PGA Tour victories he won before making the move to the Saudi-backed circuit.\n\nThe chatter about Koepka not being able to flip the switch in regular tournaments has never been more quiet after his win in Singapore.\n\nGoing back to the number four, Koepka will be looking for his fourth PGA Championship win at Valhalla in two weeks. Not only does he appear to have regained some serious confidence, Valhalla fits his game, and he knows a thing or two about winning PGA Championships.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Craig_Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TPC Craig Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/par-talk-may-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539908", "eventUri": "eng-9539908", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 3730, "textEnd": 3739}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

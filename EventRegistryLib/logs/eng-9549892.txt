The district officials said the wire connecting a CCTV camera to the monitor was disconnected disrupting live streaming on April 30. The issue was resolved in two hours.\n\nIn another incident, CCTV cameras in strong room in the Nilgiris parliamentary constituency faced a technical glitch for at least 20 minutes on April 27. The district officials said there was a technical error in CCTV cameras because of overheating and lack of ventilation.

According to the petitioner, on Apr 28 about 173 CCTVs malfunctioned in the strong room at Nilgiris parliamentary constituency for about 26 minutes followed by similar CCTV glitches in Erode on Apr 29.\n\nWhen the plea came up for hearing on Wednesday, a vacation bench of Justice AD Jagadish Chandira and Justice R Kalaimathi wondered what made the petitioner to move the plea while the primary parties that contested the elections were silent.\n\nReferring to the statements of the returning officers of the constituencies concerned that the blackouts were due to overheating and short circuit, the PIL said the reasons could not be accepted.\n\nCCTVs can withstand temperatures of 50 degree Celsius and above indoors and above 90 degrees outdoors. Tangedco has also assured that there will be no power failure in the areas where the strong rooms are located, the petitioner said. While so, the continuous blackout of CCTVs in the strong rooms is unjustifiable and creates a doubt in the transparency and fairness of the election system, he said.\n\nResponding to the plea, the commission submitted that all district election officers have been instructed to provide one additional CCTV per strong room with a new dedicated line and dedicated TV for viewing the visuals by booth agents even if there is failure in other cameras.\n\nRecording the submission, the bench closed the plea.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nilgiris_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nilgiris District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Nilgiris District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erode", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erode"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Erode"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest_litigation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest litigation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returning_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Returning officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short circuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Remodeling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Remodeling", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Security", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Security", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549892", "eventUri": "eng-9549892", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 418, "textEnd": 424, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 580, "textEnd": 586, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

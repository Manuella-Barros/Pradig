{"id": 225082798, "title": "Pope Francis Opens New Catechetical Cycle on Holy Spirt\u2019s Role in Salvation", "text": "Pope Francis on Wednesday opened a new catechetical series during his weekly general audience, focusing on the theme of creation across history and the role of the Holy Spirit in the story of salvation. Titled \u201cThe Spirit and the Bride: The Holy Spirit Guides God\u2019s People Toward Jesus Our Hope,\u201d the new cycle will unfold across three main themes: the Old Testament, the New Testament, and \u201cthe time of the Church.\u201d \u201cThe Spirit of God, who in the beginning transformed chaos into cosmos, is at work to bring about this transformation in every person,\u201d the Pope said during the general audience held May 29 in St. Peter\u2019s Square. The first part of the series will begin with an overview of creation according to the Old Testament, but it will not be \u201cbiblical archaeology.\u201d The Pope explained that it will instead focus on how the promise given in the Old Testament \u201chas been fully realized in Christ.\u201d \u201cIt will be like following the path of the sun from dawn to noon,\u201d he added. Quoting from the first two verses from the Book of Genesis, Francis observed that \u201cthe Spirit of God appears to us here as the mysterious power that moves the world from its initial formless, deserted, and gloomy state to its ordered and harmonious state.\u201d Referencing the division between the \u201cconfused\u201d and the \u201cbeautiful and ordered,\u201d Pope Francis observed that it is God who \u201cmakes the world pass from chaos to the cosmos.\u201d The Pope underscored the Holy Spirit\u2019s role in creation and as a protagonist in the story of salvation by pointing to the Psalms and the New Testament. \u201cThe Apostle Paul introduces a new element into this relationship between the Holy Spirit and creation,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cHe speaks of a universe that \u2018groans and suffers as in labor pains.\u2019\u201d The Pope emphasized that St. Paul understands the \u201ccause of the suffering of creation in the corruption and sin of humanity,\u201d which has alienated man from God and is a theme still present today. \u201cWe see the havoc that humanity has wrought and continues to wreak upon creation, especially that part of it that has greater capacity to exploit its resources,\u201d the Pope said. The Pope built upon this reflection by noting that there is both an internal as well as an external \u201cchaos\u201d inherent in man. \u201cAround us we can say that there is external chaos, social chaos, political chaos,\u201d the pope said. \u201cWe think of wars, we think of many boys and girls who don\u2019t have anything to eat, of many social injustices \u2014 this is external chaos.\u201d At the end of the general audience Pope Francis renewed his regular appeal for peace and spoke for a moment on his emotional encounter with Ukrainian children last Saturday. \u201cThe other day I received boys and girls who suffered burns and lost their legs in the war,\u201d the Pope recalled in a somber tone. \u201cWar is always cruel. These boys and girls must start walking, moving with artificial arms ... they have lost their smile. It\u2019s very bad, very sad when a child loses his smile. We pray for Ukrainian children.\u201d", "summary": "cna", "url": "https://www.ncregister.com/cna/pope-francis-opens-new-catechetical-cycle-on-holy-spirt-s-role-in-salvation", "image": "https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20240529080524_c60a164952c10faa7cfce82b571c684ebadf898bda3e8a3f8b302796bddaab5a.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:08:56", "author": "Matthew Santucci/cna", "authors": ["Matthew Santucci/cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.363}

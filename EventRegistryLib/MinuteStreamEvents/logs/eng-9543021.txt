(Atlanta News First) - On Monday, Emory President Gregory Fenves made his stance clear on any financial ties between the university and Israel.\n\n'I'm not considering and I don't support Emory divesting from Israel,\" Fenves said during a virtual meeting with Emory students.\n\nFenves' response came from a question asked by a student attendee gauging if Fenves had considered any of the demands of student protesters.\n\nAtlanta News First acquired audio recordings from the meeting and verified the statements with participants, who included both students and Emory faculty members.\n\nFenves also said he does not have a position on Atlanta's planned public safety training center, a facility that critics call \"Cop City.\" Protesters had been demanding Fenves renounce support for the controversial facility.\n\n\"Emory does not have a position,\" Fenves said. \"That's the voters electing their city leaders, and making their voices heard.\"\n\nThe meeting, which lasted roughly one hour, came as Fenves is facing multiple votes of no confidence in his leadership from different campus groups, including the faculty of the School of Arts & Sciences, and undergraduate students.\n\nEmory students launched their Vote of No Confidence on Monday; the voting window closes Tuesday afternoon. Also on Monday, Fenves announced Emory was changing the venue of its commencement exercises in the wake of protests that rocked the school and universities nationwide over protests and arrests over the Israeli-Hamas war.\n\nFenves said the university is moving its commencement activities to the Gas South District in Duluth, a complex that includes the Gas South Arena and the Gas South Convention Center.\n\nWhen asked about the votes of no confidence in his leadership, Fenves said he hopes students vote with their conscious.\n\n\"My message to students is you make your decision based on your experience as a student,\" said Fenves.\n\nEmory's Philosophy Chair Noelle McAfee, who was among the 28 people detained during an April 25 protest, was in attendance during Monday's meeting.\n\n\"Even though there is no real juridical power to the vote of no confidence, it's a signal that the people that the president is leading have no, he is not their legitimate leader in their eyes anymore,\" McAfee said.\n\nSeventy-five percent of the faculty of the College of Arts & Sciences voted \"No Confidence' in Fenves\" leadership, in results that were reported on Friday.\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, Fenves was asked by students and campus leaders about his decision to call for outside police to address the on-campus protest on April 25. \"I made the decision to clear the encampment,\" he said, adding he called for for Emory Police Department's (EPD) assistance to clear the encampment. He said EPD then called in Atlanta police for assistance.\n\nFenves said he does not know who called for Georgia State Patrol to assist. \"I want to emphasize again, EPD needed support and that support was provided,\" he said.\n\nIn video acquired by Atlanta News First, a Georgia State Patrol trooper used a taser while trying to detain a protester.\n\nIn an April 25 press release, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed troopers used a taser and deploying pepper balls to control the crowd.\n\nOn April 25, 2024, at 8:30 am, the Emory Police Department and Atlanta Police Department requested the assistance of DPS with an encampment protest at Emory University. Georgia State Troopers and Motor Carrier Officers responded to break up the encampment but were met with protestors who threw bottles and refused to leave. As Troopers and Officers began to take the protestors into custody, one actively resisted arrest. Troopers and Officers were able to place him on the ground and apply one handcuff. The subject continued to resist by shoving his other hand under his body to keep this hand from being secured with the second handcuff. Troopers twice attempted a Taser drive-stun to the subject's right shoulder but were unable to make contact. Troopers then applied a Taser drive-stun to the subject's abdomen for a 5.2 second cycle, but the subject continued to actively resist. Troopers applied a Taser drive-stun to the subject's right thigh for a 5.4 second cycle which allowed the subject to be taken into custody.\n\nDuring the encampment protest response, Troopers deployed pepper balls to control the unruly crowd but did not use tear gas.\n\nMcAfee told Atlanta News First she was disappointed that Fenves could not explain how he'd treat the protest differently in light of the controversial arrests.\n\n\"On the really important questions, I'm not seeing any change of heart,\" McAfee said. \"When I've asked repeatedly would he do anything differently, ultimately, no. I mean ultimately maybe if there was a more peaceful way to bring in the police, but no. So, it's rather shocking.\"\n\nFenves told students and school leaders the incident is still being reviewed, including the school's initial response.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "News First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_South_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gas South Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convention center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duluth, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Duluth, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper-spray_projectile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepper-spray projectile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bologna Process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trooper (police rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resisting_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resisting arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tear gas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://gray-wgcl-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/JBY6KJHPNFGYFCS4OOXD527G5Y.png?auth=4f5ad7e3553128c41240cd6c49b48f8524361e691786a3e6cca7983ee292d821&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543021", "eventUri": "eng-9543021", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2006, "textEnd": 2014, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Graduates from Oxford College as well as graduate and professional programs are invited to view the ceremony via webcast.\n\nAdditionally, each school will host a diploma ceremony where each student is individually recognized. The Emory College diploma ceremony will occur in the same arena immediately following the University Ceremony. All other school diploma ceremonies will take place at the Gas South Convention Center, located next to the Arena at the Gas South District.\n\nOn April 25, students and others calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war set up an encampment on the school's campus.

Ashoka\u2019s Lisbet Portman sat down with Bianca Tylek, founder of Worth Rises, to learn more about how she and her team are working to remove the financial incentives for incarceration via narrative campaigns, policy change, and corporate accountability. Bianca Tylek, founder of Worth Rises Kwame Owusu-Kesse Lisbet Portman: Bianca, when you started Worth Rises in 2017, what were you seeing? Bianca Tylek: We wanted to address an aspect of mass incarceration that for years went largely unaddressed. I\u2019m talking about the $80 billion industry that stands behind mass incarceration\u2014an industry that profits when more people are put away and for longer. So we set out with the very clear goal of dismantling the prison industry. Portman: You and your team mapped out 12 sectors within the industry, then prioritized prison telecom. Why? Tylek: We started with telecom for two reasons. One, the problem is simple, and two, the solution is also simple\u2014we just had to tell the story. Prison telecom is a $1.4 billion industry on its own, dominated by just three corporations that own 90% of the market share. All three are owned by private equity firms that made their billions by charging people who are incarcerated\u2014or more accurately their families\u2014egregious rates for phone and video calls placed from inside prison. One in three families who have an incarcerated loved one goes into debt because of the costs associated with calls and visits. Many families end up having to cut off communication with their loved one entirely over the cost. What does that do? It isolates people from their families, creates tensions and violence inside prison, and hurts people\u2019s ability to plan for release. Portman: In just seven years, your team has passed legislation in numerous cities, five states, and at the federal level to make communication free for incarcerated people. Tell us more. Tylek: In 2018, we passed the first piece of legislation in the country to make phone calls free in a jail system. It saved directly impacted families in New York City close to $10 million a year. We\u2019ve been able to replicate that in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Miami. Then in 2020, the policy was incorporated into the Federal Cares Act. It's one of the only components of the Act that continues today, allowing everybody in the federal prison system, the biggest prison system in the country, access to free communication. In 2021, we passed our very first state bill to make communication entirely free across the prison system of Connecticut. Four more states followed and at this point in 2024, we're running similar bills in over a dozen states.

Tylek: That\u2019s right. To date, we've been able to save families over $400 million in the cost of communication in prisons and jails. In addition to that, we've been able to create two billion additional minutes of call time. That many more people are able to just hop on the phone with their children, their spouses, their parents and grandparents who are serving time and need their support. It\u2019s big, but the even bigger story is that the industry is on the verge of collapse, literally. Not only have we disrupted its business model but we went after the corporate profiteers and their executives directly. We urged pensions to divest, blocked merger deals, and removed executives from major museum boards. We sent a clear message that our communities were not profit centers for their exploitation. Today, the largest prison telecom is likely months away from bankruptcy. Portman: Wow. How do you go about doing this? Tylek: We have a very small team with a secret sauce: a three pronged strategy of narrative change, policy change, and corporate accountability. On the narrative change side, we need to be telling stories in powerful new ways. For example, for our work challenging prison labor, we used AI to create the \u201cMost Famous Speech Never Given\u201d by President Lincoln, released earlier this year. It \u201cresurrects\u201d the former president to reflect on and urge a remedy to the exception in the 13th amendment that allows slavery as criminal punishment. On the policy side, we\u2019re introducing legislation and demanding that we can do better, with legislation like the Abolition Amendment that would end this exception. And on the corporate accountability side, we\u2019re targeting companies\u2014such as those that exploit prison labor\u2014very directly, aggressively, and sharply. We can deploy this same three part strategy in every sector of the prison industry beyond telecom and labor. Portman: A big piece of this is bringing these companies out of the shadows, including via a public database that you started as a series of reports. It has become a powerful tool for anyone trying to access data about corporations that are benefiting from incarceration. Tylek: That\u2019s right. We maintain the largest database of corporations engaged in the prison industry, now a searchable digital tool that anyone can access at data.worthrises.org. It shows over 4,000 corporations that are engaged in and profiting from some aspect of the prison industry. Today, we license that data to investment shops working with retail investors and their financial advisors to help them screen investment portfolios from the most toxic of these companies. We rate every publicly traded company with a harm score, and based on that score, they either get marked as a divestment target or not. Portman: Where is your attention going now and why? Tylek: Our plan was always to start with telecom and then move to other sectors in the industry. Now we are putting a lot of our attention on labor, as mentioned. In seven states, the majority of people who are working in prison still do not earn a cent. In most states, the average wage for people who are incarcerated is 14 cents an hour. We\u2019re also delving into healthcare, where there\u2019s a lot of attention because one of major prison healthcare corporations recently filed for bankruptcy. And the last area we\u2019re looking at is electronic monitoring, which is being pushed by the same profiteers and should be considered mass incarceration 2.0. Portman: Last question, Bianca. Have you faced coordinated resistance, and how have you overcome it? Tylek: We've definitely gotten resistance. I think that the industry at the beginning didn't think we could be successful. But what we\u2019re good at is being strategic, tactical, surgical. My background is in the corporate world. I spent the first part of my career on Wall Street as an investment banker, and our team has a deep understanding of exactly how this industry works. That\u2019s how we know what levers to pull and buttons to push to create impact. Yes, there have been efforts to pay us off, hack our systems, etc. But when you expose something, as we\u2019re doing, you bring people to your side. So just as wealthy people are organizing on the other side to protect their business, we have both people with wealth and the masses organizing on ours. Bianca Tylek is an Ashoka Fellow.

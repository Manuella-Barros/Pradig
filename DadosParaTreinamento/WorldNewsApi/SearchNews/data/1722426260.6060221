{"id": 243327098, "title": "European Championship game decided by coin toss after sides couldn't be separated", "text": "Italy's progression to the European Championship final in 1968 was decided by a mere coin toss. The current Euro 2020 champions have a rich history in the sport that was sparked by back-to-back World Cup triumphs in 1934 and 1938. After three decades without silverware, the Azzurri were one of four teams that entered Euro 1968 and were immediately matched against the Soviet Union in the semi-finals. The two nations couldn't be separated after 90 minutes with the scoreline at 0-0, while an additional 30 minutes of extra-time meant saw teams still locked in a scoreless draw. With penalty shoot-outs not used in that era to break ties, a simple coin toss from a referee was implemented when teams couldn't be separated. While the winner of the coin toss would go on to face Yugoslavia in the final, the dreaded loser would compete against England in a third-place play-off. Italy captain Giacinto Facchetti's call of tails would become a legendary one as the Inter Milan icon went on to lead his country to the final, and the Soviet Union had to settle for third place after defeating England 2-0. The late Facchetti previously discussed the surreal moment he made the anxious call as he explained: \"I went up with the Russian captain. We went down to the dressing rooms together, accompanied by two administrators from the two teams. \"The referee pulled out an old coin and I called tails. It was the right call and Italy were through to the final. I went racing upstairs as the stadium was still full and about 70,000 fans were waiting to hear the result. My celebrations told them that they could celebrate an Italian victory.\" The final saw Italy draw again 1-1 with the Soviet Union and as extra-time brought no change to the scoreline, this time a replay was played two days later. They triumphed 2-0 in that match at the Stadio Olimpico to secure their first European Championship title. The two-time Euros champions are headed to the knockout stages of Euro 2024 where they'll take on Switzerland after finishing second in Group B, having won, lost, and drawn each of their three group games against Albania, Spain and Croatia.

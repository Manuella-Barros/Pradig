{"id": 231222502, "title": "The best hotels for art lovers in Ireland and across Europe", "text": "With the Venice Biennale now in full swing, thousands of hot sweaty art lovers are shuffling their way through queues. Exhibitions and installations spread across palazzos, churches, national pavilions and the vast Arsenale, while superyachts spoil the lagoon views. On show is the work of artists representing almost 100 countries, including Ireland\u2019s Eimear Walshe with their film and installation Romantic Ireland. Stays in Venice range from the ultra luxurious and costly Ca\u2019Sagredo, which is rather like sleeping in a glorious movie set. Prices are \u20ac400-\u20ac3,000 and up, but the rooms themselves would have you weeping with joy, and you might find it rather hard to make it to the Biennale itself \u2013 if you like loads of spindly gilt-edged furniture, chandeliers and frescoes, that is. Or find apartments and B&Bs popping up all over town for Biennale stays, with prices from \u20ac120 per night for two at Airbnb. Venice gets less costly, and quieter as soon as you pull back from the main tourist areas of the Grand Canal, San Marco and Rialto. As the whole city is very walkable and is such a perfect spot to get lost in wandering around, there is no need to splash out on a prime location, unless you\u2019re feeling like you want to spend to be on show yourself. The Biennale, dubbed the Olympics of the art world, ends in November, so there\u2019s plenty of time to go, but you can also sate your arty appetite in a more relaxed fashion by checking into one of the growing number of hotels where you can sleep with contemporary art, and imagine, for the duration of your stay at least, that you are living (or lunching) in your own private gallery. Some collectors display their works in hotels, or even establish hotels for the purpose to get the relevant tax breaks, but whatever the reason it\u2019s a tasty fringe benefit to your mini break. But be warned, art and beauty are always in the eye of the beholder: one person\u2019s dream art hotel may be a recipe for another one\u2019s nightmares. Travel enough to these types of places, and you can start to play a kind of Art Bingo, as there are some artists that seem more hotel friendly than others. Andy Warhol, check. Sean Scully, check. Louise Bourgeois, full house! AROUND EUROPE Italy Byblos Art Hotel Villa Amist\u00e1 This restored palazzo, a 20-minute drive from Verona, houses an incredible collection of contemporary art works.

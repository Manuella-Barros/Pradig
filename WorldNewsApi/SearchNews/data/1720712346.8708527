The group described the Governor's comments as unfortunate and one that could lead to dissatisfaction in the ancient city. DAILY POST reports that Makinde on Saturday, said that Olakulehin would be installed as the 43rd Olubadan when he is strong enough to complete the installation processes. But, Ibile G-7 in its reaction, said the governor is not a medical doctor, so, he cannot determine if the Olubadan-designate is fit to ascend the throne or not. The group, in a statement signed by its President who is a former President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ, Lanre Ogundipe and Secretary, Jide Olaniyonu, explained that the governor's statement was a big surprise to indigenes of Ibadanland. The group said its members and other prominent sons and daughters of Ibadanland are not happy with the governor's statement. \"It is regrettable that the statement of the Governor of Oyo State Engineer Seyi Makinde on when the new Olubadan of IbadanLand Oba Owolabi Akinloye Olakulehin would be installed, has ignited and as well caused fresh controversies at a period when the indigenes of Ibadanland have gone to sleep and have forgotten that the issue was over and expecting good news about having a new person on the throne of their fatherland. \"The statement by Mr Governor claiming that Oba Olakulehin would be crowned the new Olubadan as soon as he is medically fit was a big surprise to numerous Ibadan Indigenes. Since the governor made that statement at the final burial of the immediate late Olubadan, His Royal Majesty, Oba Lekan Balogun at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium in Oke Ado Ibadan Ibadan people are now beginning to worry, as to the reason behind this statement, when it was expected that the governor would have on that day confirmed the date of the coronation of Oba Olakulehin as Olubadan. \"We in the Ibile G7 which has prominent Ibadan Indigenes as members are not comfortable with this statement and have started wondering what could have informed Governor Makinde's statement. ''We are therefore asking Governor Makinde these pertinent questions, which require and deserve urgent answers. \"In the first place, who informed the governor that Oba Olakulehin is not medically fit.? Which hospital issued a report that the new Olubadan elect is not fit and where was the Oba hospitalized to warrant that statement.? When has the issue of the installation of the Olubadan condescended to political debate or issues, at the expense of the millions of Ibadan indigenes? \"Does this mean that the silence of Governor Makinde over the recommendation of Oba Olakulehin as the new Olubadan forwarded to him since and which he too said he has accepted was a mean attempt to delay the installation process? The people of Ibadan would be happy if Governor Makinde could tell them the motive behind this statement, which is debasing and derogatory to the age-long tradition of the ascendancy into the Olubadan stool. \"We in the Ibile G7 group are sad that it is rather unfortunate that the much applauded Ibadan royal ascendancy has slipped into a controversial contest, with governor Makinde at the centre\".", "summary": "<img width=\"1080\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Makinde-.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Makinde-.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Makinde--300x184.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Makinde--1024x629.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /><p>A socio-cultural organisation consisting of Ibadan indigenes, Ibile G-7 has condemned a statement credited to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on the enthronement of the current Balogun of Ibadanland, Owolabi Akinloye Olakulehin.

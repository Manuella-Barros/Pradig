Superville, The Seattle Times The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMay 8-Seattle Public Schools is expected to take up a proposal Wednesday that could eventually close more than a quarter of the district's nearly 70 elementary schools.\n\nThe move, which could force thousands of students to switch schools in the 2025-26 school year, is aimed at curbing the district's more than $100 million annual budget gap.\n\nThe district is hoping to dig itself out of a deficit caused by years of spending more money than it took in: Federal COVID relief dollars have dried up, the district has lost more than 4,000 students since pre-pandemic years, and a three-year teachers' union contract inked in 2022 was projected to cost the district about $231 million over its term and add $94 million to the deficit.\n\nThe district's superintendent, Brent Jones, has said he plans to ask the board on Wednesday for permission to start drafting a school closure plan. If the board gives the go-ahead at its meeting today, Jones and his staff are expected to draw up a preliminary list of about 20 schools that could be shuttered or consolidated.\n\nSuch school closures would be by far the largest in Seattle in recent history.\n\nClosing school buildings could result in a range of savings.\n\nFewer schools could translate into a need for fewer staff positions: District officials say they plan to discuss possible job cuts with union-represented employees. And some staff could transfer to schools that remain open, while others could replace workers who are retiring or leaving the district. The district would also save money on building and other maintenance costs.\n\nThe board could consider that preliminary plan and an analysis of its effects next month. It would hold a vote on a final list of affected schools in the fall, after the public has had a chance to weigh in.\n\nAs it decides which schools to close or consolidate, the district anticipates looking at each school's current and 10-year enrollment projection, the age and condition of the buildings, academic offerings, and equity, district officials said. Officials say they will also examine the distances between schools and safety issues, such as traffic near schools, Jones said.\n\nThe district is using about 65% of the space at its elementary school sites to educate about 23,000 K-5 students, Jones said. At some schools, seats sit empty. Twenty-nine of the district's elementary schools have fewer than 300 students.\n\n\"That's where we are seeing the most challenge in terms of enrollment,\" Jones said. \"That's where we're also not utilizing our space and our services in the most efficient manner.\"\n\nCutting costs\n\nThe school closure proposal is part of a larger multiyear effort to put the district on firmer financial and academic footing.\n\nSeattle is among many districts contemplating closing schools as education systems across the country confront the end of COVID federal aid and declining enrollment, which is the largest determining factor in the amount of taxpayer funds school districts receive from their state governments.\n\nEnrollment had been declining in some cities before the pandemic, but the federal funds gave districts room to delay difficult budget decisions.\n\n\"It would have been really hard for districts to close schools while they were trying to get people to come back,\" said Marguerite Roza, a Seattle-based researcher and the director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University, which focuses on school finance.\n\n\"They just could not have done it all at the same time. That delay probably had some important utility in the sense that [districts] could do the reopening separately from this other discussion. Now, the problem is, it's happening all at once.\"\n\nAlthough the school closures aren't expected to take effect until fall 2025, the district is also wrestling with how to shed $105 million from next school year's estimated $1.1 billion budget.\n\nTo close its budget gap, the district is cutting staff in the central administrative office and reducing school budgets by about $5.7 million. Student-to-teacher ratios will also increase in its secondary schools from 30:1 to 31:1.\n\nSPS is also planning to borrow $32 million from its reserves and about $35 million from its capital fund, which is primarily used to pay for building construction, maintenance and other infrastructure. The district must repay the loan with interest by June 2026.\n\nThe board is expected to vote on approving the loan today. Officials say they're hoping lawmakers offer more money next legislative session to help with these loan repayments. Without legislative help, \"repayment of the loan will require further reductions in expenditures at SPS,\" district officials said Wednesday.\n\nIn December, the district projected that the 2025-26 budget hole would be even bigger than in the upcoming school year: about $129 million. Closing schools - which could save the district an estimated $50 million to $75 million - is one of the proposals to close that gap.\n\nIf the School Board says no to closures and consolidations, district officials say, the district will have to make additional changes to how it operates, including increasing student-teacher ratios, reducing staff and eliminating preschool. Even then, some closures may be necessary, Jones' proposal suggests.\n\nJones said the proposal is in line with a plan to create \"a system of well-resourced schools\" - the term the district uses to describe schools that have what students need to succeed. The idea was developed from a districtwide survey and a series of meetings last year with staff, parents, students and community members. Well-resourced schools are envisioned to include social-emotional support for students, safe buildings, inclusive learning spaces, predictable budgets, multiple teachers in each grade and staff for art, music and physical education.\n\nFewer schools would allow the district to offer \"more equitable and consistent\" services to students across the district, Jones said.\n\nMiddle and high schools are not part of the current consolidation discussions.\n\nFears about the district's budget woes have for months led to confusion and speculation about what might be on the chopping block.\n\nIn February, students and parents at Interagency Queen Anne, a small recovery high school that serves about 27 to 39 students, worried that the school was among those the district planned to close.\n\nThey mounted an online petition to keep the school open, prompting the district to clarify that it had no plans to close the school.\n\nIf the board gives Jones the green light to pursue the plan, the district has said it will hold meetings with the school communities that could be affected and use the feedback to decide which schools it will recommend closing. After the board receives the recommendations, the public will have 30 days to provide input.\n\nA final recommendation is expected in the fall, followed by a public review period, before the board makes a final decision in the fall.\n\nState law requires that districts hold public hearings during the 90-day period before a final decision is made to close a school. The law also requires a separate hearing for each affected school site.\n\nSchool Board President Liza Rankin said that families can weigh in throughout the process, not just during the legally required public comment period.\n\nRankin urged participation and said it would be premature for parents to assume their child's school will close just because it has fewer than 300 students.\n\n\"We really have to look at it as a whole system, not on a school-by-school basis, because it's really about right-sizing our operations to the number of students that we have,\" Rankin said.\n\n\"It's not a judgment or assessment of any individual school or performance or the students that go there. It's a matter of our students being spread across too many buildings for the number of students we have, which means that resources are spread very thin.\"\n\nErin MacDougall, one of the leaders of All Together for Seattle Schools, a local advocacy group with about 150 people on its distribution list, is asking the district to detail the alternatives it explored before settling on closing schools.\n\n\"Show us the thought process that went into why they chose those schools,\" MacDougall said. \"What are the criteria for selection and what are the other nuanced and more direct elements of their decision-making.\"\n\nMacDougall is also concerned that the preliminary list of affected schools will be released near the end of the school year when parents are getting ready for end-of-year rituals and summer vacations or may not be physically in the city to attend the meetings and engage in the process.\n\nThe district also hasn't provided enough information to show that it can pay back the capital fund loan it's taking out this year to cut the deficit or demonstrate it won't be in the same financial predicament in a few years, she said.\n\nRoza said districts that are contemplating closing schools should be transparent with their communities about their finances. The district's plan to borrow from its capital fund is an \"alarm bell,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't think there's a way that avoids anybody feeling upset, because no one likes to have their school close,\" Roza said. \"But you do have to bring people along. You have to have a lot of opportunities for people to go through the motions of closing a school. They have to feel heard in the process. In some ways we would say that districts need to be completely forthcoming on their financials.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brent Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tribune_(Chandigarh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tribune (Chandigarh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Switzerland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\u2013teacher_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student\u2013teacher ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Queen of Great Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Chung_Moo_Doe", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Chung Moo Doe", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.theolympian.com/wps/build/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551552", "eventUri": "eng-9551552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 71, "textEnd": 76}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Of course, school districts all over California are also running deficits right now. But the state of California feels that SFUSD's financial problems are so severe that the district could run out of cash, and the Chronicle reports that the state has now appointed monitors who have veto power over the district's spending.\n\n\"While the structural deficit has been years in the making, this is the call to action to do the hard work to disrupt what isn't working and build the school district that S.F. deserves,\" school board President Lainie Motamedi told the Chronicle. \"We expect our students to learn from their setbacks and improve their work, and the community should expect the same of us.\"\n\nThe state monitors were appointed in 2021 to give guidance to the district, but were not given explicit veto power. Now they have the ability to suspend the board or district's financial decisions, or reverse these decisions outright.\n\nThis is not the same thing as a full state takeover of the district, but it's certainly advanced oversight, and the state Department of Education says that SFUSD runs \"high\" risk of eventual insolvency. They're insisting on a hiring freeze, which the district has agreed to, and $52 million in budget cuts, which have not yet been detailed or specified.\n\nSF Superintendent Matt Wayne has argued SFUSD has too many teachers and staff, and effectively, too many schools. But teachers point out that the district spends lavishly on consultants, and wasted a ton of money on that payroll fiasco, so they feel district bloat is part of the problem.\n\nBoth arguments seem to some degree true. But the biggest issue is that SFUSD is facing declining enrollment, which means less funding from the state (a state which is now itself in a deficit, too). There is generally declining enrollment at schools across California, given factors like lower birth rates and out-of-state migration. But SFUSD has lost 10,000 students over a ten-year period, which stands out among large districts -- and highlights the fact that SF's perennial childlessness situation is getting worse, or better, depending on your perspective.\n\nAnd this whole financial disaster is likely to set up a debate over which SF schools need to close, a very divisive argument that's likely to begin this fall.", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Unified_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Unified School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wayne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wayne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.sfist.com/2024/05/sfusd-oversight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551552", "eventUri": "eng-9551552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Thousands of students have left as the city's population has dwindled. In 2015, the SFUSD boasted 53,000 students. This year it is around 49,500, with enrollment in 2032 projected to be at about 44,000. Not helping matters has been the rise of teacher pay and pension costs, which shot up dramatically in October after a near strike by teachers. Unexpected costs also struck the SFUSD too, as $34 million was spent on a payroll system that didn't work, and millions more spent on abuse claims.\n\nThis all caused the SFUSD's deficit to grow dramatically from $169 million in 2020 to a projected $421 million deficit in 2025. The SFUSD slashed 927 vacant positions in an attempt to lessen the deficit amount by $103 million, but those cuts are being challenged. The city, usually having the money to fix department finances, also can't help because of their own $780 million budget deficit. At a district planning summit in March, the SFUSD, trying to prevent a takeover of the district, said that multiple school closures would be likely by 2025.\n\nHowever, things reached a crisis point earlier this week when the California Department of Education announced that they would be sending fiscal advisors to look over some financial decisions by the district, essentially taking control of district spending. The state Superintendent also noted that the District may not be able to meet all financial obligations this year and had until June 30th to submit a corrective action plan.\n\nNeeding to quickly confront the $421 million deficit issue, the SFUSD held a special meeting on Tuesday to go over a state audit of their finances. SFUSD Superintendent Matt Wayne started off the meeting by highlighting the California DOE report and went over what state advisors said that the district should do next to avoid running out of funds next year.\n\n\"It exemplifies what you're saying is both the progress that we've made, but how far we need to go,\" said Wayne on Tuesday. \"The district is committed to accelerating our efforts to address the remaining concerns to ensure that San Francisco public schools are places where students can learn, grow, and thrive.\"\n\nHowever, state officials and watchdog groups were adamant that the state would not be bailing them out, and that the SFUSD would have to do everything they could to solve the deficit.\n\n\"So your solutions are yours,\" explained Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistant Team (FCMAT) CEO Mike Fine on Tuesday. \"The state's not going to be bailing you out of anything. Okay? You need to put your arms around this and acknowledge that there's a problem.\"\n\nDire situation for the SFUSD\n\nFollowing this, angry parents of students proceeded to grill the SFUSD board. Many were concerned about what would happen to special education, if class sizes would grow, and what exactly the board had in mind to solve the crisis outside of budget cuts, school closures, hiring freezes and a proposed $790 million dollar bond that voters may decide on in November. Many parents were also vocally distressed about a state auditor saying that the district barely has enough funds to meet the minimum financial reserve levels. San Francisco School Board President Lainie Motamedi attempted to quell concerns by answering the parents at the meeting.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done and the audit was a necessary preliminary step,\" said Motamedi. \"Right now we're in a position where we can at least see the dots that need to connect. That is the first step in the repair. I am grateful to the state's support and assistance as we work to do right by our kids, by our educators, and make sure our schools are functioning the way they should.\"\n\n\"The state report is a wakeup call. Right now we're in a position where we could at least see the dots that need to connect. It may feel worse, but having the conversation is the first step to the repair.\"\n\nWhile the next meeting on the budget crisis is scheduled for May 15th, educational financial experts have said that the SFUSD needs something short of a miracle to not enter financial distress next year.\n\n\"Everyone is bracing for what's coming soon,\" Belle Green, an accountant and advisor to many school districts in Great Lakes states, told the Globe Wednesday. \"Everyone knows that a bunch of schools will be closed as a result of this. Everyone knows that budgets are going to be slashed. No one is talking layoffs, especially after those strikes last year, but those might be coming too through budget cuts. And then there is that bond, which only goes to repairing older buildings.\"\n\n\"They keep saying that they will have a balanced budget by 2026. Every passing day that becomes more and more farfetched. The SFUSD needs to make those hard decisions now. Students are down drastically yet they have the same number of schools open. Private school popularity is at an all-time high. They need to seriously readjust. And look where their stubbornness has gotten them. $421 million in the hole. They waited until this was too big a problem. And that's why the solutions are not going to be pretty. The state was pretty clear about that.\"\n\nA School Board sub-committee hearing on the budget crisis is due to be held on May 15th.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

The strategy aims to raise capacity to 85 percent in schools that will remain open.\n\nAs more families reject public schooling, some states have started cracking down on homeschooling. In Missouri, a new bill expanding school choice initiatives could reportedly make it a \"felony\" for gun owners to have firearms in their homes if they choose to homeschool their children.\n\nIf passed, Senate Bill 727 would redefine \"home school\" as a \"school\" \"for purposes of state law.\" According to Missouri First, the previous definition of \"home school\" in Missouri only applied to a limited number of statutes; however, it claimed that the new definition would apply to all state statutes, which could potentially put gun owners at risk of violating laws that prohibit the possession of guns at schools.\n\n\"If you know anybody that lives in the state of Missouri or you currently live in the state of Missouri [and] are liberty minded, you need to be contacting your senators right now and burning up their phone lines,\" one social media user warned in a viral video.\n\n\"Some far left-wing group has spent a lot of money in Jefferson City.

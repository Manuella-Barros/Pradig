According to German publication Bild, as cited by the Mail, Tuchel had discussions with Ratcliffe in Monte Carlo on Tuesday. United are yet to communicate a decision on manager Erik ten Hag's future. Ten Hag led United to a 13th FA Cup crown last month, strengthening his chances of remaining in charge. United have not dismissed the prospect of retaining him and the Dutchman wants clarity on his position as soon as possible.

Despite all the noise concerning Ten Hag's future, not a single candidate has established themselves as a clear favourite. Tuchel, 50, is arguably one of the most polished options currently available. He won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup with Chelsea, scooped two league titles with Paris Saint-Germain and guided Bayern to the Bundesliga crown in 2022/23. Having written several success stories at some of Europe's biggest clubs, Tuchel would be within his rights to argue he would be capable of managing a club of United's stature. He has cemented himself as an elite-level coach and has often been linked with some of Europe's biggest jobs. Despite recently stopping short of confirming whether or not he would be keen on a return to England, he has previously addressed the level of responsibility that comes with managing United. He pointed out the expectation levels that come from the outside and how small situations can soon balloon because of a club of United's size. Speaking during the 2023/24 campaign ahead of Bayern facing United in the Champions League group stage, Tuchel said: \"There is always a lot of noise around Manchester United. A lot of pundits in the UK are from Manchester United. \"You have a legacy from Sir Alex Ferguson which creates expectations around the club. All of us, me in Bayern and my colleague [Ten Hag] at Man United, want to achieve the same things. \"It is pretty common at Man United that little things become a bit bigger or the talking is a bit noisier.\" Tuchel's comments highlight the fact he is aware of the challenges that come with managing United. Ten Hag, throughout his Old Trafford tenure, has had to handle a series of challenging situations, such as Cristiano Ronaldo's outburst in the latter stages of 2022 and the whole Jadon Sancho saga in September last year. As for matters on the pitch, Tuchel addressed concerns about United's lack of depth after leading Bayern to a 1-0 win at Old Trafford last December. The Reds lost Harry Maguire to injury that night, adding yet another name to what was a lengthy injury list. Speaking after the game, the German said: \"Now, you can see then they lack this kind of personality and also the quality and maybe the depth to change games from the bench. I think you could see that. \"It's not an easy time but I'm pretty sure he [Ten Hag] knows what to do next, he knows how to influence his team, he does not need my advice. He does not need my clapping on the shoulders. He's experienced enough to go through it.\"", "summary": "Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly met Thomas Tuchel amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding Erik ten Hag's future at the club.", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/thomas-tuchel-said-right-things-29322090", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29322180.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1843516466.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:55:33", "author": "George Smith", "authors": ["George Smith"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.029}

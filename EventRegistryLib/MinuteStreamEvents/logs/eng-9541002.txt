We can't eat and we can't sleep,' he told the Guardian.\n\n'What matters to asylum seekers is to be safe. I will not be safe in Rwanda. If they manage to send me there I will kill myself on arrival in that country.'\n\nThe man arrived in Britain in June 2022 and is currently being held at the Colnbrook immigration removal centre in West Drayton\n\nMigrants cross the Channel in an overcrowded dinghy on Saturday\n\nThe Syrian, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he became 'very scared' after finding out about the Rwanda scheme in February 2023.\n\nA second asylum seeker, from Sudan, said he was detained in Libya before paying his captors to free him and arriving in the UK in June 2022.\n\nREAD MORE - Migrants pitch dozens of tents along the banks of Dublin's Grand Canal just days after hundreds were evicted from 'shanty town' amid row over asylum seekers crossing the border to avoid Rwanda\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: 'I was arrested last week when I went to report in Newcastle. They didn't mention Rwanda until I reached the detention centre and at first just said ''We are deporting you to a safe third country''.'\n\nMore than 100 people are believed to have been detained so far pending deportation to Rwanda.\n\nAt least one of the men has begun a hunger strike, according to the charity Detention Action.\n\nMeanwhile, Asylum Aid is planning to bring legal action against the Home Office over the scheme.\n\nLawyers on their behalf have sent a pre-action letter to the department over the Safety of Rwanda policy, published late last month, saying it is inconsistent with the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act which became law last week.\n\nAsylum Aid says it is concerned the policy could lead to the Home Office unlawfully denying people seeking asylum from entering the UK asylum system, and that the alleged inconsistency could lead to the Home Office refusing to consider evidence of individual risk.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to see flights to Rwanda off the ground by July after the act became law, though officials are primed for legal challenges made in the wake of the detentions as they accepted some of those being held could end up being released on bail.\n\nHope Hostel in Kigali, which has been waiting to receive asylum seekers for nearly two years\n\nThe FDA trade union, which represents senior civil servants, has also threatened legal action.\n\nREAD MORE - Rishi Sunak axes plan for a summer general election in belief that Rwanda flights take-off and improving economic picture can enhance Tories' re-election bid\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe union said its move related to the relationship of the Civil Service Code with the Safety of Rwanda Act, and the power for a minister to determine whether to comply with an order made by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nA direction to ignore such an order would breach international law, which conflicts with the duty of civil servants under the Civil Service Code to act in compliance with the law, which includes international law, said the FDA.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said in response to the claims from detainees at Colnbrook: 'We take the welfare of people in our care extremely seriously. There are robust safeguarding measures in place to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and has the support they need.\n\n'All detained individuals have access to a mobile phone, internet and landline telephones so they can keep in contact with friends, family and other support.'\n\nConcerning the FDA's threat of legal action, they said: 'The Home Office already sought advice from the director general of proprietary and ethics in the Cabinet Office on the issue of the Civil Service Code and claims over the legality of implementing the Rwanda deportation scheme under the new legislation.'\n\nFor confidential support, call Samaritans on 116 123, visit samaritans.org or visit https://www.thecalmzone.net/get-support\n\nRwanda refuses to guarantee how many UK migrants it will take under \u00a3290million deal as government says living in the 'beautiful' East African state 'is not a punishment'\n\nThe Rwandan government cannot guarantee how many migrants it will take from Britain under Rishi Sunak's flagship deportation scheme.\n\nYolande Makolo, a spokesman for the east African state, said it was a 'misconception' the country is only ready to take an initial 200 migrants.\n\nBut she said she could not say 'how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year'.\n\nThe Prime Minister's plan to deal with asylum seekers arriving in the UK via irregular routes including the English Channel crossing is to place them on a one-way flight to Kigali.\n\nHe hopes this will deter other small boats attempting the journey from France.\n\nYolande Makolo, a spokeswoman for the Rwandan government, said she could not say 'how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year'\n\nRwanda has entered into a five-year deal to take in migrants from the UK.\n\nAround 52,000 migrants have come to the UK without permission since the law was changed in 2023 and could therefore be line for deportation.\n\nAsked by the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg if Rwanda would be able to process tens of thousands of migrants as part of the deal, Ms Makolo said: 'We will be able to welcome the migrants that the UK sends over the lifetime of this partnership.\n\n'What I cannot tell you is how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year. This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out right now.'\n\nShe had earlier claimed there was a 'misconception' that Rwanda was only prepared to take 200 initial migrants, telling the BBC: 'Journalists have been visiting the initial accommodation that we have secured since the beginning of the partnership. This is Hope Hostel.\n\n'That particular facility is able to take up to 200 people.\n\n'However, we have already started initial discussions with other facilities around Kigali and further afield and these will be firmed up and signed once we know how many migrants are coming and when they are coming.\n\n'So it has never been the case that we can only take 200 initially, that has been a misconception.'\n\nSir Keir Starmer has said Labour will not keep the Rwanda policy if it wins the next election, but this has prompted questions about what the party would do instead.\n\nMs Makolo urged critics of the plan not to attack Rwanda 'unjustly', and to present a solution to the migrant crisis which was 'not just deterrence and enforcement'.\n\n'People are suffering here so we need good solutions and we need to rethink the migration crisis,' she said.\n\nThe spokesman later added: 'Living in Rwanda is not a punishment. It is a beautiful country, including the weather.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These young men left a region at war, where acts of genocide were occurring and male family members had already disappeared. They claimed asylum almost two years ago. Since then, they have learned English, volunteered in our community and become integrated here.\n\nThe UK used to be a place of refuge for people fleeing from war and persecution.

What I cannot tell you is how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year. This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out right now.\n\n\"Journalists have been visiting the initial accommodation that we have secured since the beginning of the partnership. This is Hope Hostel. That particular facility is able to take up to 200 people.\n\n\"However, we have already started initial discussions with other facilities around Kigali and further afield and these will be firmed up and signed once we know how many migrants are coming and when they are coming,\" she added. \"So it has never been the case that we can only take 200 initially, that has been a misconception.\"\n\nThe Rwanda scheme involves sending some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via irregular routes, including small boat crossings via the Channel, to the east African country.\n\nPeople sent to Rwanda will have their asylum claims processed there and, if successful, granted refugee status in the country. If unsuccessful, they could seek asylum in another \"safe third country\" or apply to settle in Rwanda on other grounds.\n\nThe controversial five-year deal was initially introduced under the former home secretary, Priti Patel, in 2022 to tackle the growing numbers of people crossing the Channel in small boats. However, it has faced several legal challenges, which have prevented flights from taking off to Kigali.\n\nIt is estimated the Rwanda scheme has cost at least \u00a3300m already.\n\nMakolo told critics of the scheme to not attack Rwanda \"unjustly\" adding: \"Living in Rwanda is not a punishment. It is a beautiful country, including the weather.\"\n\nKeir Starmer said Labour would not keep the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. Instead, its national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, said the party would spend the money set aside for the Rwanda scheme on a \"proper operation to crack down on the criminal gangs\".\n\nResponding to Makolo's comments, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: \"This interview shows that more people have arrived in the last week than are likely to be sent to Rwanda over the next few years, and the Conservatives are just trying to con people with their failing plans.\n\n\"Today, we heard a stark admission that Rwanda can only take a tiny proportion of people who are arriving in the UK, yet the Government is spending half a billion pounds of taxpayers' money on this scheme.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neha_gohil@theguardian.com", "name": "Neha Gohil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McFadden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McFadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shadow Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priti Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749d4754605149e91324ce577c09c4f68fd1cb55/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=dcd7e390505dca2faf9f8f48c54b3dd6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541002", "eventUri": "eng-9541002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Hearrived here in June 2022, and has a history of suffering torture and imprisonment. He said that he and the other asylum seekers \"of many nationalities\" he is detained with are not coping with being locked up because of the imprisonment and persecution many have previously experienced.\n\n\"Everyone is so stressed in here because of Rwanda. We can't eat and we can't sleep. I was displaced in Syria for nine years and was imprisoned there and I was also detained and tortured in Libya. Being in detention is very triggering for me. What matters to asylum seekers is to be safe. I will not be safe in Rwanda. If they manage to send me there I will kill myself on arrival in that country.\"\n\nHe said when he found out about Rwanda in February 2023 he became \"very scared\".\n\n\"I went to report last week in Birmingham. They arrested me and put me in handcuffs in a police cell. The same thing happened to two other people who were reporting - Iraqi Kurds. After we were taken out of the cell we were handcuffed again and taken in a van to the detention centre. I have been trying to see a doctor in the detention centre because of an infection in my leg I need antibiotics for but so far I haven't managed to get an appointment.\"\n\nA second asylum seeker from Sudan, who was fearful to give his real name, also spent time detained in Libya. He fled Darfur, a longstanding conflict zone in the country.\n\nHe arrived in the UK in June 2022 after managing to raise the money to pay his captors in Libya to free him, travelled in a boat which almost sank across the Mediterranean and reached Italy.\n\n\"I would have been happy to claim asylum in Italy but Italian officials did not fingerprint me and told me to move on to France. There I was told it would be four years before they could consider my asylum claim so I waited in the jungle in Calais to cross to the UK. Crossing the Channel in an overcrowded boat was even more terrifying than crossing the Mediterranean.\n\n\"When I heard about the government's plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda at the beginning of 2023 I was very frightened. I escaped from an African country because it was not safe and I am very scared to be deported to another African country because I know it will not be safe for me.\"\n\n\"I was arrested last week when I went to report in Newcastle. They didn't mention Rwanda until I reached the detention centre and at first just said 'We are deporting you to a safe third country'.\"\n\nBoth men said there are long queues to access fax machines and computers to contact legal representatives and to try to meet the seven-day deadline the Home Office has given asylum seekers to oppose notices of intent for Rwanda.\n\nA letter seen by the Guardian given to people detained for Rwanda by the Home Office states that if agreement to send asylum seekers to a safe third country cannot be reached \"within a reasonable time your protection claim will be considered by the Home Office\" suggesting that not everyone detained for Rwanda will actually be sent there to have their asylum claims processed.\n\nRelated: The tortuous journey of the UK government's Rwanda plan\n\nMore than 100 people are understood to have been detained so far. The charity Care4Calais circulated data about the nationalities of those detained with the majority coming from conflict zones.\n\nHannah Marwood, the head of legal access at Care4Calais, said: \"The people detained have not had their asylum claims processed, and it's clear from the first cohort we are in contact with that if their claims were processed they would probably be granted refugee status in the UK. It reaffirms how shameful the Rwanda plan is and why it must be stopped.\"\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's national campaign coordinator, said he doubted that if they are elected, Labour would bring asylum seekers sent to Rwanda back to the UK.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said:\"We take the welfare of people in our care extremely seriously. There are robust safeguarding measures in place to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and has the support they need.\n\n\"All detained individuals have access to a mobile phone, internet and landline telephones so they can keep in contact with friends, family and other support.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The British government says it hopes to send some 52,000.\n\n\"We will be able to welcome the migrants that the UK sends over the lifetime of this partnership,\" Makolo said. \"What I cannot tell you is how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year. This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out right now.\"\n\nThis latest announcement comes just two weeks after the British government passed its Safety of Rwanda act in Parliament and a week after UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared flights would begin to take off to Kigali in as few as nine to 11 weeks.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Makolo said the only initial facility built to house the UK's asylum seekers, the Hope Hostel -- which journalists have been allowed to tour -- has a capacity of just 200 people.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, it was reported that some of the other homes built in Rwanda -- potentially to house asylum seekers -- had been sold off to Rwandan residents.\n\nMakolo assured the BBC that her government had \"already started initial discussions with other facilities around Kigali and further afield and these will be firmed up and signed once we know how many migrants are coming and when they are coming.\"\n\nMakolo said reports that Rwanda was only intending to take 200 asylum seekers initially were a \"misconception.\"\n\nDetails 'being worked on by the Home Office'\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper also made an appearance on the same BBC program on Sunday. He declined to answer directly when asked whether or not the government had a backup plan if they were not initially able to send more than 200 people to Rwanda, reported the BBC.\n\nInstead, he repeated that the plan was to begin flights in \"10 to 12 weeks,\" and that details were \"being worked on by the Home Office.\"\n\nHarper added that the government hoped for a \"steady rhythm of flights going to Rwanda throughout the year.\"\n\nThe British government last week was keen to underline that it had already begun rounding up some of those who might be on a list to be sent to Rwanda.\n\nHowever, while the Home Office released a video on the social media platform X depicting at least two of these detention operations, it was reported that the Home Office might have \"lost track\" of more than half of the 5,700 asylum seekers it said it hoped to fly to Rwanda on the first flights.\n\nDetails of numbers from the Home Office have not yet been made public, and the Home Office has repeatedly declined InfoMigrants' requests for detailed comment on the policy.\n\n'More arrivals last week than likely to be sent to Rwanda over next few years'\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is already estimated to have cost at least 300 million pounds (around 350 million euros) with further payments due when the first asylum seekers land.\n\nThe opposition Labour party, currently leading in the polls, has already declared it will not continue the scheme if it wins an expected general election later this year.\n\nOn Thursday (May 2) last week, a number of local and mayoral elections were held across the UK, in which the ruling Conservatives suffered heavy losses in several significant constituencies.\n\nLabour's Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told The Guardian that Makolo's interview \"shows that more people have arrived in the last week than are likely to be sent to Rwanda over the next few years, and the Conservatives are just trying to con people with their failing plans.\"\n\nCooper continued: \"Today we heard a stark admission that Rwanda can only take a tiny proportion of people who are arriving in the UK, yet the government is spending half a billion pounds of taxpayers' money on this scheme.\"\n\nLast week, it was reported that 711 migrants made it across the Channel in small boats in a single day. On Saturday (May 4), the news agency Reuters reported that \"dozens\" of people in two rubber dinghies had also made it to Dover. The news agency added that more than 8,000 migrants had now crossed this year.\n\nUK government continues to work to get flights off the ground\n\nBritish government data shows that 255 migrants crossed the Channel on May 4 in five separate boats. 104 migrants were prevented from crossing. The number of migrants prevented is a relatively new piece of information that the British government is releasing along with its daily tally of arrivals.\n\nIn the last seven days, generally the number of those prevented has been around half of those who actually crossed. However, on April 30, the data shows that 268 people crossed to the UK and 264 people were prevented from doing so. On May 5, some 54 people crossed the Channel and 218 people were reportedly prevented from doing so.\n\nA spokesperson at the British Home Office told Reuters: \"The unacceptable number of people who continue to cross the Channel demonstrates exactly why we must get flights to Rwanda off the ground as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe British government underlined that they \"continue to work closely with French police who are facing increasing violence and disruption on their beaches as they work tirelessly to prevent these dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys.\"", "source": {"uri": "infomigrants.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "InfoMigrants"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_wallis@infomigrants.net", "name": "Emma Wallis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shadow Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/021fca92f9f794275201f69902e9c10cb56d5286.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541002", "eventUri": "eng-9541002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 325, "textEnd": 330, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 3285, "textEnd": 3290}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 4089, "textEnd": 4094, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 4775, "textEnd": 4783}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The relocation policy faced major legal and political challenges, with the Supreme Court declaring it unlawful and deeming Rwanda an unsafe country for asylum seekers.\n\nIn response, the Conservative government finalised a new agreement with Rwanda to ensure additional safeguards and introduced a new Bill to declare Rwanda a \"safe third country\" for asylum seekers. A flagship scheme of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the legislation allows the British authorities to remove asylum seekers who have made \"unauthorised journeys\" since January 1, 2022, to 6,500 km away to Rwanda for processing of asylum claims.\n\nRwanda is one of the most densely populated African countries, with a poor human rights record and an inadequate asylum system. In this context, critics have voiced concerns about the risks associated with transferring asylum seekers without adequate safeguards, cautioning that the policy may not effectively address issues of human trafficking and dangerous boat crossings. The impoverished African nation, however, maintains that it can accommodate the influx of as many migrants as Britain sends its way.\n\nBritain's Priti Patel and Rwanda's Vincent Beirut after signing an agreement on asylum-seekers, at Kigali Convention Center, Kigali, Rwanda on April 14, 2022. | Photo Credit: SIMON WOHLFAHRT\n\nAlso Read | What is the new U.K. policy on refugees?\n\nHow did the U.K. facilitate the deportation of a failed asylum seeker to Rwanda?\n\nThe Voluntary Returns Scheme, under which a migrant was sent to Rwanda by the U.K. government on April 30 after his asylum application was rejected, is not an entirely new programme.\n\nThe plan was introduced by the Home Office in 1999 and co-funded by the European Refugee Fund. In 2002, a reintegration assistance programme was added to the scheme to help repatriated migrants meet their basic needs after arrival, such as finding a place to live, finding a job, supporting education, or starting a business in the destination country. The programme was initially valued at \u00a3500 and gradually increased to \u00a33,000 ($3,800) by 2006.\n\nThe current plan is an extension of the existing voluntary returns scheme. Under the new programme, the British government offers financial assistance to migrants and failed asylum seekers who opt to depart to a \"safe third country,\" or a country they are \"admissible to.\"\n\nA person is eligible to apply for the service if they have been in the U.K. illegally or have overstayed their visa or permission to stay; withdrawn, or want to withdraw their application to stay in the country; claimed asylum; or have an official letter confirming that they are a victim of modern slavery.\n\nFile photo of Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak speaking during a press conference at the Downing Street. | Photo Credit: TOBY MELVILLE\n\nAs for reintegration support, a one-off payment is available to those departing to a country recognised as developing by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). \"You will not qualify for reintegration support if you are a non-permanent resident national of a developing country who is departing to a country that is not on the list,\" a Home Office document, dated March 18, 2024, specifies.\n\nThe OECD categorises Rwanda as a low-income developing country. Over the years, several individuals have been sent to Rwanda from the U.K. under the VRS. As per the latest official data, 19,253 individuals voluntarily returned from Britain under the returns scheme last year. In fact, 24 of these returned to Rwanda, which data shows was their home country.\n\nWith a new treaty in place, the U.K. authorities can pay failed asylum seekers to leave for Rwanda even if it is not their home country.\n\nU.K. to deport 5,700 migrants to Rwanda this year Is Rwanda safe for refugees?\n\nLocated in the Great Lakes region of Africa, the landlocked country of Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in the world with a population of over 13 million people. The country has recorded significant progress in recent years in rebuilding infrastructure and developing its economy after a 1994 genocide, but continues to feature among the least developed nations in the world. Poverty has been a major concern as well.\n\nThe government in Rwanda has been further accused of stifling dissent, keeping tight control on media, opposition and civil society, and supporting rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"Arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities were commonplace, and fair trial standards were routinely flouted in cases deemed sensitive. There were credible reports of arbitrary detention and mistreatment of people accused of \"deviant behaviours,\" including street children, sex workers and petty vendors,\" Human Rights Watch noted..\n\nThe agency has also highlighted how Rwanda's government has continued to exert pressure on the refugees. \"Refugees who are known critics of the government have been threatened and harassed. In Africa, Human Rights Watch has documented and received credible reports of Rwandan refugees and asylum seekers being forcibly disappeared and returned to Rwanda, or killed,\" it added. The U.K. Supreme Court's ruling on the asylum policy also mentioned Rwanda's poor human rights record and highlighted the risk of ill-treatment of refugees.\n\nAround 1.35 lakh refugees and asylum seekers were registered in the country, as of September 2023, with most moving to Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. Around 90% of these refugees live in five camps across the country, while around 80% of the refugee population is highly vulnerable and fully relies on humanitarian assistance, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nInstead of dealing with numerous internal challenges and addressing concerns of human rights groups, Rwanda has now agreed to open its borders to over 50,000 more refugees in the next few years.\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame's government, however, remains unfazed. \"No matter what number is announced to arrive here tomorrow or after tomorrow ... we are capable of receiving them,\" Deputy government spokesperson Alain Mukuralinda told Reuters.\n\nEditorial | Stopping the boats: On the U.K.'s new 'Illegal Migration Law'\n\nSo, what's in it for Rwanda?\n\nAs part of the asylum plan, dubbed by some commentators as a \"cash cow\" for Rwanda, the U.K. government will give development funding to the country and has promised to meet processing and integration costs for each relocated person. Britain has already paid Rwanda 220 million pounds ($250 million), and the total cost is estimated to go up to 600 million pounds for 300 refugees.\n\nDespite criticism from several quarters, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame maintains that its decision to be part of the U.K.'s asylum plan is not economically driven or about \"trading people,\" but to offer them a better chance at life. The nation has reiterated its commitment to \"international obligations\" for \"innovative action to solve one of the world's biggest crises,\" positioning itself as a suitable place for refugees from the African region, and elsewhere.\n\n\"Rwanda has a deep, historical connection with the plight of refugees worldwide. As such, we feel a moral obligation to support the world's most vulnerable. The funds provided by the UK will be invested in Rwandan society, helping us to create jobs, improve public services and upgrade our infrastructure for the benefit of both migrants and Rwandan nationals,\" government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told news Anadolu news Agency.\n\nExperts believe that Rwanda's agreement to partner with the U.K. is an extension of these efforts to emerge as an ally of the West which is grappling with a migrant problem. \"I have heard some people claim that the U.K. gave us money, wanting to dump people here. No, we don't do that kind of thing. We are not involved in the buying and selling of people. We can't do that because of our core values,\" Rwandan President Paul Kagame said at an event.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"},

Previously, the government said it aimed to start the flights in spring.\n\nSunak said there would be \"multiple flights a month through the summer and beyond\".\n\nWhen Parliament approved the legislation, according to Home Office there were 52,000 asylum seekers who could potentially be sent to Rwanda.\n\nThe PM said there is a \"loud minority\" who will try to stop government plans to send those seeking migrants to Rwanda.\n\nBut, speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg program, Rwanda's government spokesperson Yolande Maloko said: \"I cannot tell you is how many thousands we're taking in the first year or in the second year.\"\n\nBut, when asked if Rwanda could accommodate all of the people in the current backlog.\n\n\"This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out now,\" Maloko said.\n\nPressed to give a commitment on the number that could be given homes in Rwanda Makolo said \"we are ready\".\n\nBut, she would not give an assurance it would be able to take the 52,000 people the UK would like to send, merely saying it would be \"thousands\".\n\nMinisters have said repeatedly they want the notion of being sent to Rwanda to be a deterrent for those trying to come to the UK.\n\nBut, Makolo said Rwanda had been \"attacked unjustly\".\n\n\"Living in Rwanda is not a punishment. It is a beautiful country, including the weather,\" she added.\n\nTransport Secretary Mark Harper also appeared on the show and was asked whether the UK government has a back-up plan.\n\nAlthough he didn't answer directly, Harper said the government has a \"plan to start flights going in 10 to 12 weeks that is being worked on by the Home Office\".\n\nHarper added: \"We want a steady rhythm of flights going to Rwanda through this year.\n\n\"We will continue working closely with Rwanda on the partnership agreement we have got that has got all of the safeguards in place that people want to see.\n\n\"I think if you can set up a system of deterrent through those flights you will break the business model of the organized crime groups who traffic people across the very dangerous waterway of the English Channel.\"\n\nLabour's Pat McFadden told the program he thinks the government will succeed in getting flights running to Rwanda but believes it won't fix the migration problem or be value for money.\n\nHe declined to scrap the scheme on the the first day of a Labour government, should it win the next general election, but reiterated the party does not want to continue with Sunak's policy.\n\nMcFadden also said he doubted Labour would work to return any asylum seekers back to the UK.\n\nSeparately, Makolo denied Rwandan involvement in the bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAt least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.\n\nThe US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group.\n\nMakolo said the US government had been \"very hasty to blame us without looking, without investigating this incident and without talking to the people who are effected.\n\n\"It's something that we outright reject and it's unfair,\" she added. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [],

We can't eat and we can't sleep. I was displaced in Syria for nine years and was imprisoned there and I was also detained and tortured in Libya,\" he told The Guardian.\n\n\"They arrested me and put me in handcuffs in a police cell. The same thing happened to two other people who were reporting - Iraqi Kurds. After we were taken out of the cell we were handcuffed again and taken in a van to the detention centre,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been trying to see a doctor in the detention centre because of an infection in my leg I need antibiotics for but so far I haven't managed to get an appointment,\" he added.\n\nAnother asylum-seeker who did not give his name, and who arrived in the UK from Sudan in 2022, told The Guardian that he had travelled via the Mediterranean and the boat he had been on almost sank.\n\n\"I would have been happy to claim asylum in Italy but Italian officials did not fingerprint me and told me to move on to France,\" he told the newspaper.\n\n\"There I was told it would be four years before they could consider my asylum claim so I waited in the jungle in Calais to cross to the UK. Crossing the Channel in an overcrowded boat was even more terrifying than crossing the Mediterranean.\n\n\"When I heard about the government's plans to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda at the beginning of 2023 I was very frightened.\n\n\"I escaped from an African country because it was not safe and I am very scared to be deported to another African country because I know it will not be safe for me.\n\n\"I was arrested last week when I went to report in Newcastle. They didn't mention Rwanda until I reached the detention centre and at first just said: 'We are deporting you to a safe third country'.\"\n\nThe two men told The Guardian that they faced difficulties reaching lawyers during their detention, especially with the Home Office setting a seven-day deadline for appeals against their deportation to Rwanda.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK government told the High Court in London that it expects the first deportation flights to Rwanda to take off between July 1 and July 15.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said on April 22 that he expected the first flights to leave in \"10 to 12 weeks\".\n\nThe proposed dates for the first flights coincide with the run-up to presidential and parliamentary elections in Rwanda on July 15.\n\nThe charity Care4Calais published data suggesting that of the more than 100 people detained in preparation for deportation to Rwanda, most come from war zones.\n\nThe FDA trade union, which represents civil servants and public officials, wants a judicial review of a newly passed law that declares the East African country safe, despite a UK Supreme Court ruling that said removals were illegal.\n\nThe union wants clarity about whether the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act complies with the Civil Service Code.\n\nUnder the code, the UK's politically neutral civil servants are legally obliged to \"uphold the rule of law and administration of justice\".\n\nThe new law allows ministers to ignore parts of domestic and international human rights law when deciding on deportations, as well as any \"Rule 39\" injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThat would create a potential conflict, the FDA argues.\n\nThe UK Conservative government says its Rwanda policy is designed to deter huge numbers of migrants trying to get across the Channel to the UK from northern France on small boats.\n\nIt said this week it had begun detaining failed asylum seekers with a view to deporting them to Rwanda, sparking protests.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A country intent on sending asylum seekers to one whose residents have actually applied for asylum and sanctuary in other states. But the UK-Rwanda deal, having stalled and stuttered before various courts and found wanting for reasons of human rights, has become law with the passage of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill.\n\nThe story of this deal has been a long one. On April 14, 2022, the government of Boris Johnson announced the Asylum Partnership Arrangement with Rwanda, which was intended \"to contribute to the prevention and combating of illegally facilitated and unlawful cross border migration by establishing a bilateral asylum partnership\". Rwanda, for a princely sum, would receive those whose asylum claims would be otherwise processed in the UK through the \"Rwanda domestic asylum system\" and have the responsibility for settling and protecting applicants.\n\nThis cynical effort of deferring human rights obligations and not guarding asylum seekers and refugees from harm has been made all the more hideous by Kigali's less than savoury reputation in the field. Refugees have been shot for protesting over reduced food rations (twelve from the Democratic Republic of Congo died in February 2018). Refugees have also been arrested for allegedly spreading misinformation about Rwanda's less than spotless human rights record. And that's just a smidgen of a significantly blotted copybook.\n\nNotwithstanding this, UK home secretaries have gushed over Kigali's seemingly falsified credentials. Suella Braverman, who formerly occupied the post, was jaw dropping in her claim that \"Rwanda has a track record of successfully resettling and integrating people who are refugees or asylum seekers\". This is markedly ironic given that the Rwandan government has been accused of creating its own complement of refugees running into the tens of thousands.\n\nThe UK government has a patchy legal record in trying to defend the legitimacy of the exchange with Rwanda. The Court of Appeal in June 2023 reversed a lower court decision on the grounds that those asylum seekers sent to Rwanda faced real risks of mistreatment prohibited by Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Rwanda, it was noted, was \"intolerant of dissent; that there are restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly, freedom of the press and freedom of speech; and that political opponents have been detained in unofficial detention centres and have been subjected to torture and Article 3 ill-treatment short of torture.\"\n\nThe government also failed to convince the UK Supreme Court, which similarly found in November 2023 that people removed to Rwanda faced a real risk of being returned to their countries of origin in violation of the principle of non-refoulement. That principle, by which persons are not to be sent to their countries of origin or third countries if they would be placed at risk of harm, is a cardinal rule in several instruments of international law and enshrined in British law.\n\nIn what can only be regarded as a legal absurdity, the Safety of Rwanda bill essentially directs the home secretary, immigration officials, courts and tribunals to deem Rwanda a safe country in accordance with UK law and UK obligations to protect asylum seekers. It also bars decision makers from considering the risk of refugees being sent by Rwanda to other countries and disallows UK courts from drawing upon interpretations of international law, including the European Convention of Human Rights. Effectively, a sizeable portion of the UK's own Human Rights Act 1998 has been rendered inconsequential in these determinations.\n\nA final, nasty feature of the legislation is the grant of power to a Minister of the Crown to decide whether to abide by interim measures made by the European Court of Human Rights regarding any removal to Rwanda. This is astonishing on several levels, not least because it repudiates the binding nature of such interim measures.\n\nMichael O'Flaherty, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, could barely believe the passage of such an obnoxious bit of legislation. Not only did it fly in the face of obligations to protect refugees, it constituted a direct interference in the judicial process. \"The United Kingdom government should refrain from removing people under the Rwanda policy and reverse the Bill's effective infringement of judicial independence.\"\n\nShadowing these proceedings is an unmistakable, ghoulish legacy of Australian origin. The former Home Secretary Priti Patel openly acknowledged that elements of the \"Australian model\" of processing asylum claims in third countries were appealing and something to emulate. The particularly attractive element of the plan was the refusal by Canberra to ever permit those found to be refugees to ever settle on Australian soil. Other countries, including such European states as Denmark, have also chosen Rwanda as an appropriate destination for unwanted asylum seekers.\n\nThe entire affair is a stunning example of political entropy, a howl from an administration marching before the firing squad. With each failure, the Tories have tried to claw back respectability in the hope of appearing muscular in the face of irregular migration. They have accordingly cooked up a scheme that is not merely cruel, but one of staggering cost (each asylum seeker of the current cohort promises to cost the British taxpayer \u00a31.8 million) and ineffectualness. Sunak, a laughably weak and unpopular prime minister, is, politically speaking, at death's door. Despite getting the legislation through, legal struggles from potential deportees are bound to tear into the arrangements. What Britain's judges do will prove a true test of character.", "source": {"uri": "onlineopinion.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "On Line Opinion"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It further said it intends to proceed with a judicial review if the government refuses to make amendments to its policy.\n\nThe charity initially challenged the Rwanda plan at the UK High Court in October 2022, where they argued the plan was \"unfair\" because it limits the time for those seeking asylum to make their case and get to court. Moreover, they argued the policy does not give applicants the right to make representations on the general safety of Rwanda. The court eventually ruled the timescale was not unfair and that people have no right to argue that Rwanda is generally unsafe. It further found applicants don't need to have a lawyer to make their case.\n\nThe Rwanda deal has been a topic of intense debate in the UK since its introduction in 2022. After the Supreme Court ruled that the plan was unlawful in December, the government introduced its Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024 which recently received royal assent. The Act received widespread criticism, notably from the UN, urging its withdrawal.\n\nUK authorities began last week detaining migrants it plans to deport.

Hearrived here in June 2022, and has a history of suffering torture and imprisonment. He said that he and the other asylum seekers \"of many nationalities\" he is detained with are not coping with being locked up because of the imprisonment and persecution many have previously experienced.\n\n\"Everyone is so stressed in here because of Rwanda. We can't eat and we can't sleep. I was displaced in Syria for nine years and was imprisoned there and I was also detained and tortured in Libya. Being in detention is very triggering for me. What matters to asylum seekers is to be safe. I will not be safe in Rwanda. If they manage to send me there I will kill myself on arrival in that country.\"\n\nHe said when he found out about Rwanda in February 2023 he became \"very scared\".\n\n\"I went to report last week in Birmingham. They arrested me and put me in handcuffs in a police cell. The same thing happened to two other people who were reporting - Iraqi Kurds. After we were taken out of the cell we were handcuffed again and taken in a van to the detention centre. I have been trying to see a doctor in the detention centre because of an infection in my leg I need antibiotics for but so far I haven't managed to get an appointment.\"\n\nA second asylum seeker from Sudan, who was fearful to give his real name, also spent time detained in Libya. He fled Darfur, a longstanding conflict zone in the country.\n\nHe arrived in the UK in June 2022 after managing to raise the money to pay his captors in Libya to free him, travelled in a boat which almost sank across the Mediterranean and reached Italy.\n\n\"I would have been happy to claim asylum in Italy but Italian officials did not fingerprint me and told me to move on to France. There I was told it would be four years before they could consider my asylum claim so I waited in the jungle in Calais to cross to the UK. Crossing the Channel in an overcrowded boat was even more terrifying than crossing the Mediterranean.\n\n\"When I heard about the government's plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda at the beginning of 2023 I was very frightened. I escaped from an African country because it was not safe and I am very scared to be deported to another African country because I know it will not be safe for me.\"\n\n\"I was arrested last week when I went to report in Newcastle. They didn't mention Rwanda until I reached the detention centre and at first just said 'We are deporting you to a safe third country'.\"\n\nBoth men said there are long queues to access fax machines and computers to contact legal representatives and to try to meet the seven-day deadline the Home Office has given asylum seekers to oppose notices of intent for Rwanda.\n\nA letter seen by the Guardian given to people detained for Rwanda by the Home Office states that if agreement to send asylum seekers to a safe third country cannot be reached \"within a reasonable time your protection claim will be considered by the Home Office\" suggesting that not everyone detained for Rwanda will actually be sent there to have their asylum claims processed.\n\nMore than 100 people are understood to have been detained so far. The charity Care4Calais circulated data about the nationalities of those detained with the majority coming from conflict zones.\n\nHannah Marwood, the head of legal access at Care4Calais, said: \"The people detained have not had their asylum claims processed, and it's clear from the first cohort we are in contact with that if their claims were processed they would probably be granted refugee status in the UK. It reaffirms how shameful the Rwanda plan is and why it must be stopped.\"\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's national campaign coordinator, said he doubted that if they are elected, Labour would bring asylum seekers sent to Rwanda back to the UK.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said:\"We take the welfare of people in our care extremely seriously. There are robust safeguarding measures in place to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and has the support they need.\n\n\"All detained individuals have access to a mobile phone, internet and landline telephones so they can keep in contact with friends, family and other support.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Home Office did not dispute the charity's findings.\n\nMost of the people known to have been detained come from countries from which nearly all asylum seekers have previously been granted safety in the UK.\n\nCrossbench, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers told that they were \"alarmed\" that people who are likely to have well-founded asylum claims for protection in the UK were being denied the opportunity to be processed in Britain.\n\nThey also fear Afghans who worked with the British could be among those sent to Rwanda.\n\nThe Government rejected an amendment to its Safety of Rwanda bill which would have stopped Afghans who supported British troops being subjected to the scheme, instead giving an assurance that the department would not send anyone who had been accepted under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) to Rwanda.\n\nLiberal Democrat peer Lord German said he feared some Afghans may fall through the cracks, in part because the Rwanda plan means that the Home Office does not consider people's case for fleeing their homes prior to deportation.\n\n\"If they're not hearing their cases first... how do they know? There are undoubtedly people falling through the hoop,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a fundamental human right, it seems to me, that people have should have a chance to put their case forward, and what they're doing is denying that opportunity not just for the most vulnerable groups of people in the world, but also for those who may have helped the UK Armed Forces. It is shameful.\"\n\nPeople who have arrived in the UK illegally, such as by small boat, are eligible to be sent to Rwanda - regardless of where they come from.\n\nOne in five of those known to have been detained are from Syria, 18 per cent are Afghans, 15 per cent are Sudanese, and 14 per cent are from Eritrea, data from Care4Calais shows.\n\nNearly all asylum seekers from these countries have previously been accepted in the UK, meaning their claims are found to be legitimate after Home Office investigation.\n\nIn the year ending December 2023, 99 per cent of people from Afghanistan, Syria and Eritrea were granted asylum, Government data shows, along with 98 per cent of Sudanese people.\n\nA further 14 per cent of people being supported by Care4Calais after being detained are from Iran. 85 per cent of asylum seekers from Iran are granted protection in the UK.\n\nHowever, under the Rwanda scheme, their claims for asylum won't be heard in the UK first. Instead, they will be sent to Rwanda to have their claims processed, and if accepted they will be able to build new lives in Rwanda with no option to return to the UK.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to get flights off the ground by July.\n\nLord German said he feared that some Afghans who worked with the British could be missed because many were not employed directly by the Armed Forces but by contractors, making the trail of work more difficult to trace.\n\nHe also said that the assurance given by the Home Office not to deport collaboraters only applies to those already in the UK, meaning it would not cover anyone who arrives in the future.\n\nThe ARAP scheme has been criticised for being too narrow and too slow to process and resettle Afghans.\n\n\"It is absolutely disgraceful that people are not giving given an opportunity to put their case forward,\" Lord German added.\n\n\"I have no qualms at all about returning people... who are just looking for a better life, but these are people who have suffered so much and been put in this position. And if they were given the chance, most of them would have been given a place in the United Kingdom. It is so perversely opposed to what I would call human dignity. We on our benches have found it incredibly difficult to comprehend how somebody could kick people when they're down, because that's what it is.\"\n\nLord Alf Dubs, a Labour peer and former child refugee, said it was \"shocking\" that people from high grant rates were among those being deported but that it was an \"inevitable\" consequence of Government policy under the Illegal Migration Act.\n\n\"The Government said that people who have crossed the channel [are] illegal and therefore they won't be able to claim asylum, so they set this in motion some time ago. So I find it shocking, but I'm not totally surprised. I think it's a miserable situation, because it means we're denying people who have a well founded fear of persecution any chance of claiming asylum at all,\" he said.\n\nLord Dubs also questioned whether asylum seekers being deported may have family in the UK, and highlighted the risks of inadvertantly sending children to Rwanda due to age disputes - where the Home Office categorises someone as an adult but they maintain that they are under 18.\n\nBut the Labour peer said he was hopeful that the Home Office would stick to their assurance not to deport ARAP Afghans, saying: \"What can we do but accept the assurance? I think we just have to believe them on this one. I don't believe them on most things, but possibly on that one I do.\"\n\nCross bench peer Lord Carlile said he feared that Afghans who worked with the British could be missed in the Rwanda scheme's processes.\n\n\"We got assurances that no one who had been of assistance to the British forces in Afghanistan would be deported under this scheme involuntarily. My concern is [whether] they're doing the checks properly, because there was no evidence during the House of Lords debates that they had made these checks in any clear or accountable way,\" he said.\n\n\"[It] Really doesn't matter where anyone comes from - the fact is that Rwanda is not yet demonstrably safe because Rwanda has not yet complied with the obligations under the treaty.\"\n\nLord Carlile said it was \"alarming\" that these nationalities were being deported and denied their attempt claim asylum in the UK.\n\n\"At least some of them would almost certainly be granted asylum if they were able to apply for it, so there's been a fundamental denial of legal rights,\" he said.\n\nLast week, met Afghan asylum seekers outside Lunar House, Croydon. Some of them said they were afraid to go inside to attend their appointments in case they were detained.\n\nOne man from Afghanistan arrived with two friends - also Afghans but with British citizenship - because he was scared to go to the appointment alone.\n\n\"Our friend worked with the British in Afghanistan, but now he's terrified of being sent to Rwanda,\" his friend, a 31-year-old delivery driver, said.\n\n\"He worked in the courts where they prosecuted terrorists, and his family have been threatened because he refused to hand over documents to them. But the translator misinterpreted his job and described him as a postman. The Home Office rejected his claim and now he's appealing.\n\n\"I've come with him to support him. I have British citizenship, and we've taken the time off work to come with him from Kent. He thinks he will be taken to Rwanda. People are feeling very scared. We drove an hour to get here, and I kept saying, don't stress, don't worry.\"\n\nThe Government introduced the Rwanda bill during a surge in the number of people making unsafe journeys across the Channel in overcrowded dinghies, arguing that the scheme will deter people from making the crossing.\n\nThe scheme has been the subject of several legal battles, with the Supreme Court ruling in November that it was unlawful due to the risks of asylum seekers being wrongly sent from Rwanda to countries where they are at risk.\n\nSince then, the Government has bolstered its support to the Rwandan Government to help process the asylum seekers properly, with revealing last month that Home Office staff have been asked to apply for jobs in Rwanda to help process the asylum claims of migrants sent there from the UK.\n\nThe Government also passed the Safety of Rwanda bill, which overrode the Supreme Court's judgement to declare Rwanda a safe country.\n\nIt comes as the number of Channel crossings surges, with 711 people making the journey in a single day last week - a record for this year.\n\nSo far this year, 7567 people have made the journey, according to Home Office figures up to 30 April. This is a jump of 27 per cent on the same time last year, when 5946 people had made the crossing.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"The first illegal migrants set to be removed to Rwanda have now been detained by highly trained operational teams, following a series of nationwide operations this week.\n\n\"We will get flights off the ground to Rwanda in the next nine to eleven weeks, creating the deterrent effect to help break up the people smuggling business model and stop the boats.\"\n\nIt is Government policy not to comment on individual cases.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk",

It cited the Home Office as saying the move is a \"safety and security\" measure.\n\nThe detentions follow the passage of the Safety of Rwanda Bill by the UK Parliament last month, paving the way for the start of deportation flights.\n\nThe legislation aims to block court challenges that have stalled the enforcement of an initial agreement between London and Kigali to send asylum seekers who entered the UK illegally to the East African nation for claim processing. The five-year agreement reached in April 2022 was stymied by an intervention from the European Court of Human Rights, which halted the first deportation flight two months later. Last November, the UK Supreme Court also ruled the scheme illegal, declaring Rwanda an unsafe third country for refugee relocation.\n\nSunak's Conservative government, which has committed to \"stopping the boats\" since taking office in 2022, has insisted the Rwandan scheme will address the influx of illegal immigrants entering the English Channel. According to recent government figures, more than 7,000 people arrived on 'small boats' in the first four months of this year, an increase of more than 1,400 since the same January-April period last year.\n\nMore than 120 potential deportees have so far reportedly contacted some of the several charity organizations in the UK that are against their detention and removal to assist them with immigration lawyers to oppose the scheme.\n\nAsylum Aid, which works with some of the most vulnerable refugees in the UK, has warned the Home Office that it will take legal action to challenge the policy, which it claims is causing widespread fear and distress among migrants.\n\nAn estimated 52,000 asylum seekers in the UK are reportedly eligible to be sent to Rwanda under the deportation scheme. However, Kigali's spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, said on Sunday that the country cannot guarantee how many people it can host.\n\n\"We will be able to welcome the migrants that the UK sends over the lifetime of this partnership.

Last week protesters prevented a coach taking asylum seekers from a hotel in Peckham, south London, to the Bibby barge in Dorset.\n\nDespite the ban, more than 120 migrants have so far contacted charities opposed to the Rwanda scheme who are putting them in contact with immigration lawyers.\n\nCharities such as Care4Calais have been distributing information leaflets to asylum seekers which include their emergency number to get around the restrictions.\n\nMany are expected to seek bail from the removal centres, raising the risk of absconding, and challenge their deportations on the basis that Rwanda is unsafe for them individually or could cause them \"serious and irreversible harm\".\n\nSteve Smith, chief executive of Care4Calais, said: \"Removing smartphones degrades the ability of those detained to communicate and to access information. They immediately lose access to their contacts list.\n\n\"They cannot perform a search function to track down those who might help them, such as charities like ourselves, or law firms.\n\n\"They become isolated from the latest news. For example, they won't hear about protests in their support.\n\n\"Additionally, brick phones are only set up to communicate in English. For example, you can't send a text in Arabic. They have no translation function such as Google translate. This further isolates the detainee.\n\n\"Their level of distress cannot be overemphasised. The removal of their smartphones is simply adding to the sense of shock and trauma.\"\n\nThe Home Office said migrants detained for deportation were provided with \"basic\" mobile phones due to \"safety and security.\" They could have their own phone \"without internet\" or a phone that had \"limited internet facilities\" on a secure wireless network approved by the Home Office.\n\nIt came as Rwanda's official spokesman Yolande Makolo said her government could not guarantee to take the tens of thousands of migrants who are currently banned from seeking asylum in the UK after arriving illegally across the Channel.\n\nAsked by the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg if Rwanda would be able to process tens of thousands of migrants as part of the deal, Ms Makolo said: \"We will be able to welcome the migrants that the UK sends over the lifetime of this partnership.\n\n\"What I cannot tell you is how many thousands we are taking in the first year or the second year. This will depend on very many factors that are being worked out right now.\"\n\nThere are more than 50,000 migrants currently \"in limbo\" because they arrived after the illegal migration act became law, banning them from claiming asylum, but unable, as yet, to be deported to Rwanda.\n\nMs Makolo also demanded that Foreign Office should review its advice to LGBT+ travellers that they could face abuse and discrimination if they travelled to Rwanda.\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, on Sunday confirmed a Labour government would not bring back migrants who had already been sent to Rwanda but is expected to allow those \"in limbo\" to claim asylum.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If they manage to send me there, I will kill myself on arrival'\n\nLONDON: A Syrian asylum-seeker in the UK set to be deported to Rwanda has said he will kill himself if sent to the East African country.\n\nThe man, identified as Khaled, is being held at Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre with a number of other people due to be sent to Rwanda.\n\nHe told The Guardian: \"Everyone is so stressed in here because of Rwanda. We can't eat and we can't sleep. I was displaced in Syria for nine years and was imprisoned there and I was also detained and tortured in Libya.\n\n\"Being in detention is very triggering for me. What matters to asylum-seekers is to be safe. I will not be safe in Rwanda. If they manage to send me there, I will kill myself on arrival in that country.\"\n\nKhaled has been in the UK since 2022, and discovered he could be sent to Kigali for the first time in February 2023. He was detained with a view to removal last week.\n\n\"They arrested me and put me in handcuffs in a police cell. The same thing happened to two other people who were reporting -- Iraqi Kurds. After we were taken out of the cell we were handcuffed again and taken in a van to the detention centre,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been trying to see a doctor in the detention centre because of an infection in my leg I need antibiotics for but so far I haven't managed to get an appointment.\"\n\nAnother asylum-seeker who did not give his name, and who arrived in the UK from Sudan in 2022, told The Guardian that he had traveled via the Mediterranean and the boat he had been on almost sank.\n\n\"I would have been happy to claim asylum in Italy but Italian officials did not fingerprint me and told me to move on to France. There I was told it would be four years before they could consider my asylum claim so I waited in the jungle in Calais to cross to the UK. Crossing the Channel in an overcrowded boat was even more terrifying than crossing the Mediterranean,\" he said.\n\n\"When I heard about the government's plans to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda at the beginning of 2023 I was very frightened.\n\n\"I escaped from an African country because it was not safe and I am very scared to be deported to another African country because I know it will not be safe for me.\n\n\"I was arrested last week when I went to report in Newcastle. They didn't mention Rwanda until I reached the detention centre and at first just said 'We are deporting you to a safe third country.'\"\n\nThe two men told The Guardian that they were struggling to contact legal representatives while in detention, with a seven-day deadline imposed by the Home Office for those wishing to appeal the decision to send them to Rwanda.\n\nThe charity Care4Calais has published data suggesting that of the more than 100 people detained to be sent to Rwanda, most come from war zones.\n\nThe charity's head of legal access, Hannah Harwood, said: \"The people detained have not had their asylum claims processed, and it's clear from the first cohort we are in contact with that if their claims were processed they would probably be granted refugee status in the UK. It reaffirms how shameful the Rwanda plan is and why it must be stopped.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We take the welfare of people in our care extremely seriously. There are robust safeguarding measures in place to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and has the support they need.\n\n\"All detained individuals have access to a mobile phone, internet and

It cited the Home Office as saying the move is a \"safety and security\" measure.\n\nThe detentions follow the passage of the Safety of Rwanda Bill by the UK Parliament last month, paving the way for the start of deportation flights.\n\nThe legislation aims to block court challenges that have stalled the enforcement of an initial agreement between London and Kigali to send asylum seekers who entered the UK illegally to the East African nation for claim processing. The five-year agreement reached in April 2022 was stymied by an intervention from the European Court of Human Rights, which halted the first deportation flight two months later. Last November, the UK Supreme Court also ruled the scheme illegal, declaring Rwanda an unsafe third country for refugee relocation.\n\nSunak's Conservative government, which has committed to \"stopping the boats\" since taking office in 2022, has insisted the Rwandan scheme will address the influx of illegal immigrants entering the English Channel. According to recent government figures, more than 7,000 people arrived on 'small boats' in the first four months of this year, an increase of more than 1,400 since the same January-April period last year.\n\nMore than 120 potential deportees have so far reportedly contacted some of the several charity organizations in the UK that are against their detention and removal to assist them with immigration lawyers to oppose the scheme.\n\nAsylum Aid, which works with some of the most vulnerable refugees in the UK, has warned the Home Office that it will take legal action to challenge the policy, which it claims is causing widespread fear and distress among migrants.\n\nAn estimated 52,000 asylum seekers in the UK are reportedly eligible to be sent to Rwanda under the deportation scheme. However, Kigali's spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, said on Sunday that the country cannot guarantee how many people it can host.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Court of Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/663901242030273a01745251.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541002", "eventUri": "eng-9541002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

They can either settle in Rwanda or another country but they cannot return to the UK.\n\nThe UK will end up paying Rwanda about 370 million GBP for this scheme over the next five years.\n\nThe new law, which was passed after the UK Supreme Court had ruled against it, is simply downright inhumane. Those who seek refuge in the UK are often from war zones, the poorest, most marginalised, politically persecuted people. They risk life and limb to escape their lives of misery, often on small boats organised by criminal gangs across the English Channel, which has also lead to a number of deaths.\n\nOnly days ago, 5 people died as they tried to cross over in a boat from France to England including a child. These are people willing to risk their lives to escape, desperately holding out for a better future.\n\nTo turn them away so ruthlessly tells you everything you need to know about the Tories and Sunak's desperate bid to save his party from a totally embarrassing defeat in the general elections later this year.\n\nRead more by Nidhi Razdan Backlash grows as US campuses respond to Gaza protests Heatwave or voter fatigue: Reasons for low turnout in India's Phase-I voting BJP's narrative on Constitution: Strategic move or damage control? Worrying global precedent\n\nThe new law has come in for strong criticism. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement: \"Protecting refugees requires all countries -- not just those neighbouring crisis zones -- to uphold their obligations. This arrangement seeks to shift responsibility for refugee protection, undermining international cooperation and setting a worrying global precedent.\"\n\nAmnesty International in the UK called the legislation \"a stain on this country's moral reputation\".\n\nThere is a reason that the UK's top court had struck down the Rwanda Bill as unlawful. It had cited Rwanda's safety record. What a cruel irony it is to send those running away from persecution, to a country where these refugees may find it even harder.\n\nThe court said the plan also went against the European Convention on Human Rights. Those who are seeking safety and security need compassion and help. Not to be kicked out to Africa.\n\nSpanner in Sunak's plans?\n\nYes, the problem of undocumented migration is real and the UK needs to find a way to streamline processes and put systems in place rather than a mass deportation policy. But politically, Sunak probably figures that it will pay to fear monger, to talk about protecting borders and keeping illegal migrants out.\n\nThe Rwanda policy is not just a morally unacceptable but also a really bad policy. For the UK, it means paying out hundreds of millions of more pounds over the next few years while it faces possible legal challenges even now such as in the European Court of Human Rights. The UK is still part of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nMeanwhile British authorities have started detaining asylum seekers and the first flights to Rwanda are expected to take off as early as July. Hopefully the legal challenges will be put a spanner in Sunak's plans.\n\nNidhi Razdan\n\n@nidhi\n\nNidhi Razdan is an award-winning journalist.

It is worth remembering that this is an Act of Parliament rushed through the parliamentary process by the government using its majority. Its sole purpose is of overturning a finding by the Supreme Court that Rwanda was not a safe third country for those seeking refuge from persecution. The Act, alongside the government's Illegal Migration Act, mark a huge backward step in the UK's commitment to the Refugee Convention and offering a refuge to those in need of protection.\n\nOver the weekend, media reports emerged that the government was seeking to act swiftly by lining up increased use of detention powers, holding people pending a possible removal to Rwanda with a view to removals potentially taking place at some point.\n\nThe passing of the act has, of course, caused alarm and distress to many people who are currently in the UK, who have left their homes due to human rights abuses and persecution and who have been waiting for their asylum claims to be processed.\n\nBindmans have worked for years on asylum and refugee law, and we continue to do so.

This statement implies the beginning of the deportation of asylum seekers arriving in Britain illegally within 10-12 weeks, following the long-awaited parliament vote on the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, which facilitates the removal process of these people.\n\nThe international community strongly criticised this decision, calling on the English government to reconsider the plan's implementation. Instead, critics invite it to take practical measures to address the irregular flows of refugees and migrants coming to the United Kingdom through international cooperation. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), stated that \"the new legislation marks a further step away from the UK's long tradition of providing refuge to those in need, in breach of the Refugee Convention. [...] This arrangement seeks to shift responsibility for refugee protection, undermining international cooperation and setting a worrying global precedent.\"\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), shared similar concerns, saying that \"by shifting responsibility for refugees [...] and limiting the scope of domestic and international human rights protections for a specific group of people, this new legislation seriously hinders the rule of law in the UK and sets a perilous precedent globally.\" He then added that \"it is critical to the protection of the human rights and dignity of refugees and migrants seeking protection that all removals from the UK are carried out after assessing their specific individual circumstances in strict compliance with international human rights and refugee law.\"\n\nSunak's decision to carry on with the implementation of the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership is concerning. The provision, which has already been deemed unlawful by the British Supreme Court and the international agencies dealing with asylum seekers and migrants, namely the UNHCR, the OHCHR, and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). If implemented, it would set a dangerous precedent and hinder people's ability to seek refuge in Britain and other countries. By being deported to Rwanda, their rights would not be protected nor respected, and the international standard of nonrefoulement, which guarantees that no one should be returned to a country where they would face torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and other irreparable harm, would not be observed.\n\nThis new legislation is the third in a series of increasingly restrictive British laws that have eroded access to refugee protection in the United Kingdom since 2022, reports the UNHCR. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed the first law in April 2022, which can send anyone who arrived in Britain illegally after January 1, 2022 to Rwanda, a country 6400km away. After becoming Prime Minister in late 2022, Sunak pledged to carry on with this plan, making \"stopping the boats\" one of the priorities of his political agenda. Although the British Supreme Court has tried to prevent the implementation of the law, the government seems adamant in pursuing its enforcement as a way to tackle migration into Britain and limit expenses associated with it. It costs more than 3 billion pounds per year to process asylum applications, and 8 million pounds per day on housing migrants awaiting decisions on their status in hotels and other accommodation.\n\nWhat lies ahead for asylum seekers and migrants coming to the United Kingdom? According to UNHCR, if implemented, the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership Treaty would \"pave the way for asylum-seekers to be summarily sent to Rwanda to present their asylum claims, with no prospect of return to the UK.\" Moreover, the ability for these people to challenge or appeal these decisions would be severely circumscribed, since judges and decision-makers would be required by law to deem Rwanda a \"safe\" country- regardless of any evidence to the contrary. The public outcry must grow louder, urging the UK to uphold its moral and legal obligations. Only time will tell whether the British government will side with the most vulnerable or keep pursuing its inhumane political agenda.

Mr. Cleverly had remarked, \"Rwanda is slightly underpopulated because of the genocide it suffered 20 years ago, and its economy will benefit from the migrants that are due to be sent from Britain.\" This statement was promptly refuted by IGICUMBI, highlighting several inaccuracies.\n\nFirstly, IGICUMBI corrected the timeframe of the genocide, clarifying it occurred 30 years ago, not 20, as Mr. Cleverly claimed. They also contested his characterization of Rwanda's population status. Contrary to his statements, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with a current population density of 584 people per square kilometer, according to recent data from Statista.\n\nAdditionally, the association criticized the British government's rationale that Rwanda could benefit economically from receiving asylum seekers from the UK. Citing World Bank statistics, IGICUMBI noted Rwanda's high unemployment rate of 14.9% in 2023, questioning how a population that includes many unskilled and possibly illiterate refugees could aid in economic advancement. They emphasized that Rwanda needs a qualified workforce rather than an influx of unskilled asylum seekers.\n\nThe letter also addressed the broader political implications of the UK's policies. IGICUMBI condemned the use of the Genocide as a justification for the Safety of Rwanda Asylum and Immigration Act 2024, describing it as a misuse of historical events for political gain. They pointed out that such misrepresentations harm the survivors' representation and management of the Genocide's memory.\n\nDr. Philippe B\u00e1s\u00e1bose, the President of IGICUMBI, signed the letter, which was also sent to notable figures including His Majesty Charles III, King of the United Kingdom, The Rt Honourable Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister of the UK, and His Excellence Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda, among others.

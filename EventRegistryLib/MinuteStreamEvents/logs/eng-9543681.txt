Dell is both \"very lucky\" to be alive and to have avoided structural damage to his leg, per sources, as he was in the middle of a crossfire in Sanford, Fla., between two shooters with one 16-year-old suspect was arrested and in custody,\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"It's frightening,\" Texans principal owner Cal McNair said Monday during the team's annual charity golf tournament. \"You just try not to get into those situations, and sometimes it happens. We're just grateful that I think no one was seriously hurt, and it looks like Tank is making a full recovery. I saw him in the office the other and he looked good, in good spirits. So, he'll have to rehab and get back to where he was.\"\n\nTexans coach DeMeco Ryans emphasized that Dell will be 'fine.\"\n\n\"I talked to Tank, we had a good conversation,\" Ryans said. \"I've talked to him several times and Tank will be fine.\"\n\nBoth Ryans and the McNair family said that their conversations with Dell about the incident will remain private ones.\n\n\"That's kind of between us and Tank,\" Texans foundation vice president Hannah McNair said. \"That's a hard situation to be in. I think that's something we'll talk about privately. In any situation in life, you're going to learn something from it.\"\n\nDell is healing up quickly and is considered likely to be cleared for physical activity at some point this spring and is expected to make a full recovery in advance of training camp in July, per sources.\n\nDell was released from the hospital one day after the incident and traveled back to Houston after being shot last during an altercation he wasn't a part of at Cabana Live. Ten people, including Dell, a former University of Houston standout, suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Most of the victims, including Dell, sustained leg injuries, according to Seminole County law enforcement officials.\n\nDell posted a photograph of himself on Instagram on Friday wearing the Texans' new red uniform with a caption: 'God I thank you' along with a praying hands emoji.\n\nWho is Tank Dell? Houston Texans wide receiver recovering after being shot in Florida\n\nSince the incident,, Dell has been at the Texans' training facility to meet with team officials, including Ryans.\n\n\"We have been made aware that Tank Dell was a victim of a shooting in Sanford, Fla., last night,\" the Texans said in a statement last weekend. \"He sustained a minor wound, but has been released from the hospital and he is in good spirits. We are in contact with him and his family and will provide more updates when appropriate, but we ask that you please respect his privacy at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the incident.\"\n\nDell was in Florida to visit his mother in his hometown of Daytona Beach.\n\nThe Texans' dynamic wide receiver previously made a full and speedy recovery from a broken fibula that interrupted a strong rookie season.\n\n\"Tank is a great person, a great player, came from Hannah's school, she's a proud Cougar,\" Cal McNair said when asked about the former third-round draft pick. \"It's good for the city,\"\n\nDell has been participating in the Texans' offseason conditioning program, participating in extra throwing sessions with Pro Bowl quarterback C.J. Stroud and extra training sessions with NFL trainer Justin Allen and private coach Delfonte Diamond.\n\n\"He looks great,\" Stroud said in April. \"He's gotten a lot better. Mentally, I think for both of us, really all of the rookies coming into Year 2, everything is starting to slow down, and the wheels aren't turning so much up in your head. You're starting to play ball. Being able to throw with him in L.A. was really big.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: How Texans wide receiver Tank Dell plans to 'hit the ground running' this offseason as speedy recovery continues\n\nDell was on track for 73 catches, 1,096 yards and 11 touchdowns when he got hurt. Dell broke tight end Owen Daniels' rookie franchise record for touchdown catches.\n\nFour of the Texans' catches of at least 20 yards or more came on Dell touchdown receptions. That's the third-highest mark in the league for any receiver with touchdowns of at least 20 yards, at the time of his injury.\n\n\"Tank is back and he's starting to get in with our guys here with the offseason programs,\" Ryans said on April 15 at NRG Stadium. \"So, I'm excited to have Tank back. That was a devastating loss for us last year, losing him. He's such a dynamic player for us, such an inspiration for myself, a lot of our team. So, I'm excited to see Tank back working with our guys, and excited to see him make that same jump I talked about from Year One to Year Two.\"\n\nPerhaps Dell could become a Pro Bowl selection one day.\n\n\"I think so, too,\" trainer Justin Allen said. \"I think the injury cut him short, but God has a plan. I'm excited to see what he does Year 2 and he will reap all the benefits. One thing I like working with him is his attitude. You can't teach it. Very few players have that type of talent with his mindset and humble eagerness.\"\n\n\"To be honest with you, he hasn't lost a beat,\" trainer Delfonte Diamond told KPRC 2. \"He looks 10 times faster. Yes sir, he's a special breed. He's moving like he's always been doing. He ran full speed.\"\n\nDell previously told KPRC he would be ready for organized team activities in the spring.\n\n'He looks great .. dynamic player for us, such an inspiration,' Texans upbeat about speedy recovery of Tank Dell\n\n\"He'll be more than ready for the time OTAs jump off,\" Diamond said. \"He's way ahead of schedule. I can't wait to see No. 3 put that helmet back on. That first year was the teaser. He's fixing to up the price.\"\n\nWatching his good friend, Stroud, put on a show at the Pro Bowl Games only provided more motivational fuel for Dell to get back on the field catching passes from the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely by the time they come back, I'm going to hit the ground running,\" Dell told KPRC 2 during the Tristar Productions autograph show at NRG Arena after the season. \"I'm going to be ready. I'm just waiting on 7 and those guys to come back from enjoying their time off and we'll get back to work.\n\n\"The offseason has been good, just rehab every day, Monday through Friday, Saturdays on my own. Trying to get one percent better, so, once we do come back for OTAs, I'm ready to go.\"\n\nDell got hurt in the 11th game of the season while blocking on a red-zone run as bodies awkwardly crumpled his leg in a scrum.\n\nAlthough the season ended prematurely and Dell could have provided a boost to the AFC South champions, the Florida native still set a franchise rookie record with seven touchdown catches. He finished with 47 receptions for 709 yards.\n\nDell put on a show as a rookie, delivering a series of dynamic performances in a potent passing connection with Stroud.\n\nAlthough relatively undersized at 5-foot-8, 165 pounds, Dell excelled through a combination of crisp route running skills, body control and speed.\n\nNow, Dell is working on achieving another quality: patience.\n\n\"I just feel that was a test run for me,\" Dell said. \"I had a lot more to display, but God puts you through things for a reason. So I just kept my head up. I know the years to come are going to be special here. It's going to be good.\"\n\nThe Texans, one year removed from a 3-13-1 season under former coach Lovie Smith, finished 11-8 under coach DeMeco Ryans and won the division title for the first time since the 2019 season. They won a playoff game over the Cleveland Browns before falling in the AFC divisional round to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\"It's been great seeing the guys accomplish so much,\" Dell said. \"So many people sold us short this year. We wanted more, but that's just a steppingstone, a starting point, to what we're going to be in the future.\"\n\nWhen Dell got hurt, he was in the hospital to undergo surgery to repair the damage to his leg. During that time of his convalescence, he was visited or got messages from multiple teammates.\n\n\"Tank is my brother,\" Stroud said. \"I don't think blood can make us any closer. I think it shows on the field, and we're going to build on that. It happens naturally. We're boys. You don't force stuff with your boy. We're both tremendously excited to keep this going and work hard to be great.\"\n\nDell has an infectious personality and a love for the game. He's wide open on his routes because of his ability to convincingly sell a route.\n\nNow, it's time for a comeback.\n\n\"God gives his strongest soldiers the toughest battles, so it made me grow a lot and made me sit back and really dedicate my whole life to playing football,\" Dell said. \"It showed me how much I need this sport. This is what keeps me going. This is my blessing in life, I feel like, just to be out here and put smiles on other people's faces. The fans, the coaches, my teammates.\"\n\nThe bond that Dell and Stroud built together is a strong one.\n\nThey're counting on each other to manufacture an even better season together after engineering a turnaround last year.\n\n\"That came to fruition, so we're just trying to keep going,\" Dell said. \"Everybody knows the end goal is the Super Bowl. So from this day forward, it's what we're working toward.\"\n\nAaron Wilson is a Texans and NFL reporter for KPRC 2 and click2houston.com.", "source": {"uri": "click2houston.com", "dataType": "news",

We're just grateful that I think no one was seriously hurt.\n\n\"I saw [Dell] in the office the other and he looked good, in good spirits.\"\n\nDell, one of Houston's breakout stars en route to an AFC South division title, was visiting family in Daytona Beach earlier in the week before the shooting. While attending a private event, a fight broke out, eventually leading a gunman to begin firing shots into the crowd, striking Dell among others.\n\nSince the shooting, two people have been arrested, including a 16-year-old suspect. None of the injuries sustained in the shooting were life-threatening. Dell received immediate medical attention and was released from the hospital Sunday morning.\n\nDell broke his silence on the event last week, posting a photo to his Instagram in the Texans' new Battle Red uniforms with the caption: 'God I thank you' along with a praying hands emoji.\n\n\"He'll have to rehab and get back to where he was,\" McNair said.\n\nAs the Texans' No. 2 target, Dell hauled in 47 passes for 709 yards and seven touchdowns in 11 games. He was on pace to break Andre Johnson's team rookie receiving record entering December, but suffered a season-ending broken fibula against the Broncos that required surgery.\n\nSince then, Dell's been rehabbing in Houston and seemed to be back on track to practice before the shooting. Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said that he's spoken to Dell several times since the shooting and that they had a \"good conversation.\"\n\n\"Tank will be fine,\" Ryans said.\n\nWhen pressed further on Dell's status for the start of OTAs next month, Ryans declined to comment.\n\n\"I've answered all that about Tank -- he'll be all right,\" Ryans said.\n\nWhen asked further about the incident, both Ryans and the McNairs elected to keep the details private.\n\n\"That's kind of between us and Tank,\" Texans foundation vice president Hannah McNair said. \"That's a hard situation to be in.

Dell was not at the event and has yet to address the shooting publicly since it took place on April 28. Dell was one of 10 victims shot in a mass shooting outside the The Cabana Live in the Orlando suburb of Sanford.\n\nNone of the shooting victims suffered life-threatening injuries, according to authorities on the scene. On the day of the shooting the Texans announced that Dell \"sustained a minor wound but has been released from the hospital and he is in good spirits.\"\n\nMcNair echoed that sentiment on Monday while telling reporters that it was \"frightening\" to hear the news of the shooting.\n\n\"It looks like Tank will make a full recovery,\" McNair said. \"We saw him in the office the other day, and he looked good, in good spirits. But he'll have to rehab and get back to where he was.\"\n\nPer AP, Ryans was reticent to discuss Dell's situation and declined to answer when asked if he expected Dell to be ready to play in Houston's Week 1 game in the fall. He did say that he's spoken several times with Dell and that they had a \"good conversation.\"\n\n\"I've talked to him several times and Tank will be fine,\" he said, per Aaron Wilson of KPRC 2 Houston\n\nWilson reports that Dell was an innocent bystander in the shooting and sustained a flesh wound in one of his legs. Dell had previously recovered from a fractured fibula that cut short his standout rookie season. It's not clear if the injuries are to the same leg.\n\nDell had been participating in Houston's offseason conditioning program and throwing sessions with quarterback C.J. Stroud. Per Wilson, a source told him that Dell his healing \"quickly\" from his gunshot wound.\n\nDell emerged as one of Houston's primary offensive weapons as a rookie, tallying 41 catches for 709 yards with seven touchdowns in a 11 games before injury cut his season short. He was a favorite target of quarterback C.J.

He played with Nico Collins this past year but now will line up alongside Stefon Diggs in three wide receiver sets. Houston also re-signed tight end Dalton Schultz, drafted Cade Stover and traded for running back Joe Mixon.\n\nThat's quite the offense for second-year quarterback C.J. Stroud coming off an NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year season. The Texans also returned offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik and quarterbacks coach Jerrod Johnson.

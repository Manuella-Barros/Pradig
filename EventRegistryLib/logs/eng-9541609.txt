I told him that I forgive you and want you to know that I love you,\" Germany explained.\n\n\"God had his hands on the pastor,\" McCallister told the station. \"He wasn't letting him go nowhere.\"\n\nPolite was charged with criminal attempted homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person, court records show.

The man had walked in and out of the room several times, Germany said.\n\nPolite now faces multiple charges, including aggravated assault and attempted homicide.\n\nBail was denied for Polite and he is set to face a preliminary hearing on the charges next week.\n\nPolice investigating deadly shooting at home of suspect\n\nAllegheny County Police are investigating after a man was found shot to

The pastor says the gunman, 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite, smiled at him before raising the gun and pulling the trigger.\n\nAs this plays out, the pastor takes cover under a podium, while a member of the congregation, Deacon Clarence McCallister who also runs the camera for the live stream, runs and tackles Polite. After the deacon jumps on Polite, Pastor Germany comes forward to help subdue the attacker.\n\nPastor Germany says it's a true act of God that the man's gun jammed, and he says the deacon who jumped on the man is the real hero in all of this. He says,\n\nHe could have lost his life in that struggle, but he sacrificed himself for everyone, and he's the hero.\n\nGermany says he had never seen the suspect before. He saw the man that day for the first time.

He faces numerous charges, including aggravated assault and attempted homicide, and was being held Monday without bail at the Allegheny County Jail. State police said they they didn't know if Polite has an attorney, and county court records did not list one.\n\nThe body of a shooting victim was found in a home near the church where Polite had been shortly before going to the church, county police said.

He wandered over to the church after hearing music coming from there, according to court documents.\n\n\"I am feeling grateful that I woke up this morning and that I am here.

horrified congregation", "body": "The offender, a man battling mental illness, was quickly tackled by the Deacon\n\nA church service in Pennsylvania nearly took a fatal turn this week when a man pulled a gun on a pastor in the middle of his sermon.\n\nBernard Polite, 26, of Braddock, Pennsylvania, was charged after he entered the church Sunday and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany as he delivered his weekly address at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church.\n\nThe attempted shooting took place at just after 1pm Sunday and was captured on video and posted online for all to see the horrifying moment.\n\nBernard Polite, 26, of Braddock, Pennsylvania, was charged after he entered the church Sunday and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany as he delivered his weekly address at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church\n\nThe video shows the moment Germany finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun that is fired at him by a disheveled-looking man.\n\nMiraculously, no bullet came out and the shooter was then promptly tackled by the church's Deacon Clarence McCallister, who can be seen leaping in front of the camera and tackling the offender to the floor.\n\nMcCallister told CBS News that he saw 'something that need(ed) to be done, and I jumped up and handled my business.'\n\nGermany, whose live was likely saved by McCallister's quick thinking, called him a 'hero,' but also credited God with being the one who 'stopped and jammed this gun.'\n\nThe pair were then able to keep Polite under control until police arrived and he was taken into custody.\n\n'This guy was just dealing with spirits he said, and he came in and wanted to shoot somebody,' said the pastor.\n\nHe said that Polite, who ultimately apologized to Germany, is clearly facing a form of mental illness.\n\nThe pastor said he forgave his almost-killer, but hasn't personally processed the day's events yet.\n\n'The thing that hurts me the most and brings tears to my eyes because I couldn't watch my daughter break down,' he said.\n\nShocked church-goers look stunned in the aftermath of an attempted shooting at a Pennsylvania service on Sunday\n\nThe spiritual leader's 14-year-old was sitting among the pews during the service that took a dark turn.\n\n'I still had to be strong, because I had to be strong for her, but I couldn't take it, and just seeing her, that's the part that's hard for me to digest,' added Germany.\n\nAhead of the shooting, Germany said Polite flashed him a grin and walked in and out of the service a number of times.\n\nHe hopes to use the shocking incident to stress the reality and severity of mental illness in their own community and beyond.\n\nThe young man is now facing multiple charges, including aggravated assault and attempted homicide.", "source": {"uri":

Unlike the Islamic terrorist who just weeks ago savagely stabbed an Australian bishop mid-sermon, the man who approached Germany was armed with a handgun.\n\nAlthough the gunman allegedly left a corpse at home, he would not leave another before the Christian church's altar.\n\n\"I started to begin to preach, and all of a sudden, from my left-hand side, I saw him move from the back to the front of the church, and he set up in the front corner of the church and smiled at me,\" Germany told WTAE-TV. \"All of a sudden, I just saw a gun pointing right at me. And at that point, all I could try to do is run for cover.\"\n\nFootage of the incident shows the gunman, identified by police as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite, take aim at the pastor, then allegedly attempt to pull the trigger. Pennsylvania State Police indicated the firearm \"failed to discharge.\"\n\n\"I'm thankful to God that I'm still here, because he definitely pulled the trigger,\" said Germany.\n\nThe gunman's trigger pull was met with neither a thunderclap nor a gunshot, but rather the heroic charge of the church's deacon, Clarence McCallister.\n\nAs McCallister closes in on Polite from the rear, the video shows the would-be shooter attempt to get a clear view of Germany, who leaped behind a podium for cover. However, before the gunman can line up a shot, McCallister tackles him, gripping him tightly until Germany can wrest the gun out of his control.\n\nPastor Germany indicated that the deacon who ran to his defense \"could have lost his life in that struggle.\"\n\n\"He sacrificed himself for everyone, and he's the hero,\" added Germany.\n\nMcCallister told KDKA-TV, \"There's something that needs to be done, and I jumped up and handled my business.\"\n\nThe pastor reportedly spoke to Polite before police carted him away and accepted his apology.\n\n\"This guy was just dealing with spirits, he said, and he came in and wanted to shoot somebody,\" Germany told KDKA. \"He said you ducked a taco today, that's what he told me, and I guess that's slang for you ducked a bullet.\"\n\nAccording to the charging document, Polite told police he tried to gun down the pastor because \"Gold told him to do it\" and he wanted jail time to clear his mind, reported WTAE.\n\nPolite stands a good chance of landing plenty of time to clear his mind, as he was charged with multiple offenses including aggravated assault and attempted homicide. Polite has been denied bail. His potential role in the death of Derrek Polite remains unclear.\n\nKDKA reported that the Eastern Regional Mon Valley Police Department received a call about a shooting around 8 p.m. Sunday and discovered the body of 56-year-old Derrek Polite in a home along Stokes Avenue in North Braddock. One nearby resident reported hearing a gunshot earlier in the day.\n\nNeighbors told WTAE that there had not previously been any problems with Bernard and the victim, both of whom were described as nice.\n\n\"Nothing bad has ever happened in that home.

Nicholas writes and edits anywhere between 7 to 9 stories per day on average for PEOPLE, spanning across each vertical the brand covers.\n\nA gunman tried to shoot a pastor at a church in Pennsylvania over the weekend, and a dead body was later discovered in his home, authorities said.\n\nGlenn Germany was delivering his service at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church in North Braddock on Sunday, May 5, when the suspected gunman -- who was identified by police as Bernard Junior Polite, 26 -- allegedly attempted to shoot him, according to a news release from Pennsylvania State Police.\n\nPolite's gun \"failed to discharge,\" however, police said, which allowed a congregation member and the pastor to \"subdue and disarm\" the perpetrator before anyone was harmed.\n\nThe alleged gunman was then held until authorities arrived, according to police. He is currently charged with criminal attempt - criminal homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person, per court records obtained by PEOPLE. He is not facing any charges in relation to the body found at his home.\n\nPolite had bail denied and is currently being held in the Allegheny County Jail. He has a preliminary hearing scheduled for later this month, the documents show.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if Polite has legal representation to comment on his behalf.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint obtained by WTAE, Polite told authorities that he tried to shoot Germany because \"God told him to do it.\"\n\nHe also said he wanted to go to jail to clear his mind, the outlet reported.\n\nAfter Polite's arrest, police discovered the body of a man who was shot to death inside his home, per WTAE.\n\nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office identified the man as Derek Polite, 56, on Monday, May 6, PEOPLE can confirm. So far, no charges have been filed in connection with the body that was found.\n\nSpeaking with the Today show, which shared footage of the incident from a live stream of the sermon, on May 6, Germany shared more details about the ordeal and said he forgives Polite for what he did.\n\n\"He said, 'Look, spirits was in my mind. They got in my mind and they told me come in and shoot the pastor,' \" Germany said of what Polite allegedly told him.\n\n\"He actually apologized to me. I told him, 'I forgive you and I want you to know I love you,' \" the pastor continued.\n\nAlso speaking with Today, Clarence McCallister, a deacon at the religious establishment, reacted, stating, \"God has his hands on the pastor.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Braddock,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_County_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegheny County Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTAE-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTAE-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allegheny County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allegheny County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/N8ilNavAnWQNcgk9jvK1JtgWom4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(791x425:793x427)/Pennsylvania-Pastor-Has-Gun-Pulled-on-Him-During-Sermon-050624-dafd927268e947f4a36a89b55db8d7a2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541609", "eventUri": "eng-9541609", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 602}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1966, "textEnd": 1971, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He left the church between 8 and 9 p.m. Sunday after spending time with parishioners.\n\n\"You can tell it brought us closer together as a church,\" he said. \"We just stayed there and just supported one another, spoke about the incident, saw how the children were doing. The adults were all fine, and we just really talked with one another.\"\n\nGermany said that he was physically unharmed in the incident, though he admitted he is still rattled by the attempted shooting's impact on his family. His wife and daughter were in the audience Sunday, and his brother, Gary Germany, who is the senior pastor at the church, was also present.\n\n\"Watching the effect on my daughter, when we got in the car, seeing her break down, it really just broke me down,\" Germany said.\n\n\"Just making sure she's OK has been my priority at this point.\"\n\nDuring Sunday's service, Germany was preaching about \"Understanding the Ways of God.\" He had heard from his brother that he was expecting guests. When he saw Polite walk in and out of the church, he thought he was his brother's guest, until Polite came up to the front of the church and pulled out a gun.\n\n\"When I saw the gun, I was just trying to get out of the way. I didn't have time to think, I just reacted,\" Germany said.\n\nThe church's deacon, Clarence McCallister, leapt into action and tackled Polite. McCallister and Germany worked together to take the gun away from him and held him down until police arrived.\n\nGermany described his survival as a miracle, and called McCallister a true hero.\n\n\"He was unselfish and unafraid to actually jump on a guy who he saw having a gun,\" Germany said. \"I'm just glad and grateful. It was truly a miracle.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_maruca@triblive.com", "name": "Julia Maruca", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braddock,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miracle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/05/7318913_web1_ptr-ShootScreenGrab-050724.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541609", "eventUri": "eng-9541609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Many are calling that a \"miracle,\" given that the man had the gun trained right on Germany.\n\nThe man, 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite, then climbed over the railing to get at the pastor. Then, a member of the congregation who was filming the service for the church, Clarence McCallister, saw what was happening and jumped over the railing, wrestling the gunman to the ground. McCallister even managed to get the gun away from Polite.\n\nGermany praised McCallister, \"He could have lost his life in that struggle, but he sacrificed himself for everyone, and that's a, he's the hero.\"\n\nMcCallister said he was just glad no one got hurt, especially when Polite had the gun aimed directly at Germany's head. Germany said while they were holding Polite there waiting for the police, he asked him why he did what he did.\n\n\"I asked him, you know, just as calm as me and you are talking now -- I said 'What made you do it? What were you thinking?' and he said, 'I don't know,'\" Germany said.\n\nThen, the police found a dead body in the home of the gunman. That man was later identified as Derek Polite, 56, and he had been shot to death. The police are still investigating that incident.\n\nSo far, Bernard Polite has only been charged in the church shooting; he has not been charged in relation to the death of Derek Polite yet. Among the charges he now faces for what he did at the church is an attempted homicide charge.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Polite told the police, \"God told him to do it.\" So, if it wasn't already a question, that made clear that Polite likely has some mental health issues.\n\nWe saw a similar wild attack on Bishop Mar Mari Emanuel in Sydney, Australia, when a teenager rushed the Bishop who was preaching in church and started stabbing at him. Parishioners all jumped in to help and saved the Bishop. The police now believe that incident was terrorism. Then, the Australian government tried to go after Elon Musk and X for not taking down posts in relation to the attack. Musk said this amounted to \"global content bans.\" One radical politician said he should be locked up for challenging their speech restrictions.\n\nThere has been no motive determined yet in the North Braddock crimes.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWATCH: Another Shocking Stabbing Rampage in Sydney As Man Attacks Bishop, Others on Livestream\n\nElon Musk Throws Down in Effort to Protect Free Speech in Australia Over 'Global Content Bans'", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_arama@redstate.com", "name": "Nick Arama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulpit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulpit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miracle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Braddock,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarence (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/32/2b98a630-6eb5-489e-9cec-c921653df3dc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541609", "eventUri": "eng-9541609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

According to CNN affiliate WTAE, the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Bernard Polite, was arraigned on several charges including attempted homicide. It's unclear...\n\n(CNN) -- An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus' Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday, raised a gun toward the pastor's face and pulled the trigger.\n\nWhat happened next may have been divine intervention, Pastor Glenn Germany said.\n\n\"I'm thankful to God that I'm still here, because he definitely pulled the trigger,\" Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.\n\nThe gunman \"attempted to shoot, but the firearm failed to discharge,\" Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.\n\nThe incident in North Braddock was captured on the church's livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger, a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.\n\nState police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.\n\nIt's not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday, WTAE reported.\n\n\"All of a sudden, I just seen a gun pointing right at me,\" the pastor told the affiliate. \"And at that point, all I could do was run for cover.\"\n\nAs Germany ran and hid behind a lectern, the church's cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground, according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.\n\nPolite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person, court records show.\n\nHe was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail, and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.\n\nAfter the attempted shooting at the church, police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite's home, Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite, a relative of the suspect from the church incident.\n\n\"County Police can confirm Bernard Polite, a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church, is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim,\" police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.\n\n\"At this point, no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.\"\n\nCNN's Lechelle Benken contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

John Fetterman's (D) former mayoral stomping grounds, the broadcast of North Braddock's Jesus' Dwelling Place Church gave witness to what Pastor Glenn Germany suggested was an act of God. Seen during Sunday's livestream, a man later identified as 26-year-old Bernard Polite with a deceased relative in his home, approached the pastor, aimed and allegedly fired.\n\n\"I'm thankful to God that I'm still here because he definitely pulled the trigger,\" Germany told WTAE after the incident.\n\nIn the video, the pastor abruptly stopped his sermon when he recognized the threat, throwing up his hands and seeking cover behind the lectern.

That's what he told me and I guess that's slang for 'You ducked a bullet,'\" the pastor added.\n\nA statement from the Pennsylvania State Police detailed the events seen in the video and explained that church members had held the suspect until law enforcement arrived, arrested him and filed charges that court documents specified as attempted criminal homicide, aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person.\n\nAmid the investigation of Polite, the body of a 56-year-old man was discovered in the nearby home where the suspect resided. The decedent, a victim of a gunshot wound, was identified as Derek Polite, believed to be an uncle of the suspect, and confirmed by Allegheny County Police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky as a relative in an email to CNN.\n\n\"County Police can confirm Bernard Polite, a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church, is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim,\" the email stated. \"At this point, no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.\"\n\nAs for the church incident, Polite was arraigned Monday, denied bail and had a preliminary hearing scheduled for May 13.\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC's \"Today,\" Germany made clear, \"He actually apologized to me. I told him, 'I forgive you and want you to know I love you.'\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He approached the pastor as he dove for cover and was tackled by one of the 25 church attendees, Deacon Clarence McCallister.\n\n\"He stood up and he smiled at me. And it was just a smile,\" Pastor Glenn Germany told NBC affiliate WPXI. \"He comes to right here and then all of a sudden, that's when I see him pull the gun and all I could do is duck and try to get out of the way.\"\n\nAfter the gun was wrestled out of the man's hands, churchgoers looked around in disbelief.\n\n\"He pulled the gun; it clicked,\" Germany told WPXI. \"You heard him shoot it. God jammed the gun so the bullet didn't come out.\"\n\nGermany said the gunman told him the voices in his head made him shoot the pastor.\n\nPolice identified the gunman as Bernard Junior Polite, 26, from Braddock, who faces attempted murder charges.\n\nAfter the church incident turned up a gruesome crime scene was reportedly discovered in Polite's home. Police found a man who was fatally shot.

Many churches even call their worship areas sanctuaries, so it's easy to believe that if anyone should feel safe and secure in public, it's at church.\n\nUnfortunately, we know that evil is rampant in this world, which makes pastors and congregations vulnerable. A recent story out of the Pittsburgh area demonstrates this sad reality.\n\n\"A man is facing charges after Pennsylvania State Police say he tried to shoot a pastor who was giving a sermon at a church in North Braddock,\" reports WPXI. \"Video taken at the church shows Pastor Glenn Germany preaching at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church on Lobinger Avenue at 1:09 p.m. on Sunday.\"\n\nThe man, 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite, strode up the aisle with his gun pointed at Germany. But then a miracle happened.\n\n\"Police say the man tried to fire the gun, but it did not go off,\" WPXI reports. Germany phrases it a little differently: \"God jammed the gun, so the bullet didn't come out.\"\n\nAs Polite lurched toward the altar, Germany dove behind the pulpit for safety. Deacon Clarence McCallister tackled Polite, and he and Germany grabbed the gun from the would-be shooter's hand.\n\nNot surprisingly, there's a mental health component in this case. Polite told Germany that voices, or \"spirits,\" as he referred to them, drove him to try to shoot the pastor.\n\nOn Sunday night, police responded to a call at Polite's home, where they found a dead body. The victim has the same last name, but it's not clear from WPXI's report what relationship the two had.\n\nEven though Polite faces charges of attempted murder for the would-be church shooting, Germany has forgiven the man.\n\n\"He actually apologized to me,\" Germany told WPXI. \"I told him that 'I forgive you and want you to know I love you,' but yes, I definitely forgave him.\"\n\nRecommended: Sunday Thoughts: The Awesomeness of God's General Revelation\n\nThis story resonated with me because our church recently launched a security team to keep our people safe. We've hired off-duty deputies for years, and we still pay them on both campuses on Sundays and at our midweek recovery ministry service. But the volunteer security team is another layer of protection for the congregation.\n\nOur team includes current and former law enforcement, current and soon-to-be-retired military, nurses, a retired firefighter, and a former staff member who knows every inch of the church building inside and out (yours truly). Our responsibility as a team is to be vigilant and prepared to identify threats and assist the deputies in neutralizing them. We also have an extensive medical bag that medically trained team members can use to assist injured people.\n\nIt's not just shooters our security team looks out for; we also make sure that the building is secure on all fronts. We're always ensuring that doors are closed and locked and that there's only one way into the building. We check to make sure that people aren't in areas where they don't need to be. A couple of Sundays ago, I caught a teenager roaming our preschool ministry hallway. He had caught the locked door when somebody walked out of it and just wandered in. I don't think he meant any harm, but I had to usher him out.\n\nI'm a firm believer in churches taking measures to keep congregations secure. I encourage you to speak with your church leadership to ask what measures they have in place to keep you and your family safe. If you're so inclined, offer to get some training and start a security team. In a place where everyone should feel spiritually safe, it's important for everybody to feel physically secure as well.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_queen@pjmedia.com", "name": "Chris Queen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPXI", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WPXI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miracle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Braddock,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Braddock, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Book of Revelation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulpit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulpit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Church (building)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/pj/images/up/2024/127/578d56f0-8fa4-4436-9b7c-b8721d78f4dd-650x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541609", "eventUri": "eng-9541609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

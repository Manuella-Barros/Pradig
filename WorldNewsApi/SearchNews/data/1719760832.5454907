Mains Examination: GS-III: Challenges to internal security through communication networks, role of media and social networking sites in internal security challenges, basics of cyber security; money-laundering and its prevention. What\u2019s the ongoing story- A large number of Indians are falling prey to financial fraud carried out over the Internet, allegedly by criminals based in three contiguous southeast Asian countries: Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. Prerequisites: \u2014 What is cybercrime? \u2014 What is NCRP? \u2014 What is the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)? \u2014 Map work: Location of Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos PDR. Key takeaways: \u2014 In its analysis of trends seen from January to April, the I4C found that 46% of such frauds reported in this period in which the victims cumulatively lost an estimated Rs 1,776 crore \u2014 originated in these three countries. \u2014 \u201cThe I4C works under the Union Home Ministry \u201cto create an effective framework and ecosystem for the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of cybercrime in the country\u201d. \u2014 The I4C has identified four broad categories of fraud originating from these three countries, following certain modus operandi. It includes trading scams, digital arrests, investment scam, and romance/ dating scams. \u2014 I4C zeroed in on Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia after analysing data on its National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP), inputs received from states and Union Territories, and some open-source information. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the challenges related to cyber security in India? \u2014 What measures can be taken to combat cyber crimes in India? \u2014 What are the initiatives taken by the government to tackle the cyber crimes in India? (Thought Process: Know Cyber Security initiatives in India- Computer Emergency Response Team \u2013 India (CERT-IN), Cyber Surakshit Bharat Initiative, National Cyber Security Coordination Centre (NCCC), Cyber Swachhta Kendra, I4C) \u2014 What is the Budapest Convention?

Mains Examination: GS-I, GS-III: Important Geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes, Tsunami, Volcanic activity, cyclone etc., geographical features and their location; Disaster and disaster management. What\u2019s the ongoing story- Amitabh Sinha writes- \u201cSix people were killed in West Bengal in incidents triggered by cyclone Remal that struck the coastline on Sunday night\u2026Though effective early warning systems and timely evacuations have greatly reduced human casualties from cyclones over the years, a few deaths of accidental nature, and destruction of thatched or weak structures in coastal areas are possible.\u201d Prerequisites: \u2014 What is cyclone Remal? \u2014 What is a cyclone and what are its types? \u2014 What is a landslide and what are the types of landslides? \u2014 Organisations to look for: India Meteorological Department (IMD), World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Key takeaways: \u2014 \u201cRemal has led to largescale damage in the relatively faraway Northeast as well. Heavy rain caused by the cyclone triggered landslides in several places in Meghalaya, Mizoram, Assam, and Nagaland, which have resulted in the deaths of at least 30 people so far.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe heavy downpour in the Northeast was not unexpected. The IMD had warned of this in all its cyclone bulletins\u2026.Cyclone-triggered landslides have hit Northeastern states on earlier occasions as well.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe latest episode spotlights the need for building resilience to multi-hazard disasters. One event can trigger another, and can lead to multiple disasters simultaneously. \u2014 \u201cAlthough India has done well to prepare and safeguard itself against certain natural events such as cyclones, landslides remain a weak point. An early warning system is still being tried out, and pressures from population, development, and infrastructure projects have increased vulnerability.\u201d \u2014 \u201cAbout 0.42 million square km of India\u2019s landmass, or about 13% of its area, spread over 15 states and four Union Territories, is prone to landslides, according to the Geological Survey of India (GSI). This covers almost all the hilly regions in the country\u2026This area is also prone to earthquakes, which too, are a major trigger for landslides\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe NDMA has been working with GSI and other agencies to mitigate and manage the risks from landslides. A National Landslide Risk Management Strategy was finalised in 2019, which talked about vulnerability mapping, identifying the most vulnerable locations, development of an early warning system, and preparation of mountain zone regulations. But most of the work still remains to be done.\u201d \u2014 \u201cSome early warning systems have been developed and deployed on a trial basis at a few locations. These warning systems are linked to rainfall forecasts from IMD.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe risk from landslides has been exacerbated by the failure to remain mindful of the terrain\u2019s ability to withstand the load. Many hilly areas do not have building regulations. Often, regulations are not implemented effectively. New constructions, infrastructure development, and even agricultural practices can increase the risk of landslides.\u201d \u2014 \u201cEvery mountainous area has a carrying capacity. Development is essential, and one cannot stop the creation of infrastructure or new facilities or economic activity for local populations. But these have to be regulated. Sustainability has to be factored in, so that the load does not exceed the carrying capacity. This is where zoning regulations come in. These have to be finalised and implemented strictly,\u201d Debi Prasanna Kanungo, a scientist at Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee, said. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the favourable conditions for the formation of tropical cyclones? \u2014 What is the \u201clandfall\u201d of a cyclone? \u2014 What causes landslides? \u2014 What measures has the government taken to reduce the risk of landslides? \u2014 What steps can be taken to tackle the challenge of landslides? Post Read Question: In the South Atlantic and South-Eastern Pacific regions in tropical latitudes, cyclone does not originate. What is the reason? (UPSC CSE 2015) (a) Sea surface temperatures are low (b) Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone seldom occurs (c) Coriolis force is too weak (d) Absence of land in those regions Other Important Articles Covering the same topic: ISRO releases the Landslide Atlas of India: Which states, regions are most vulnerable Why an accused in jail can contest, but cannot vote in an election UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance Mains Examination: GS-II: Constitution, Polity What\u2019s the ongoing story- Last week, Amritpal Singh, the jailed head of the pro-Khalistan outfit Waris Punjab de, announced his intention to contest the Lok Sabha elections. Though his ability to campaign may be limited, his right to contest polls while facing criminal charges will not be under question unless he is convicted. Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the \u2018basic structure\u2019 doctrine of the constitution? \u2014 What is the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RP Act)? \u2014 What are the constitutional status of the Right to vote and the right to contest elections? Key takeaways: \u2014 In 1975, the Supreme Court in the case of Indira Gandhi v Raj Narain recognised that free and fair elections are a part of the \u2018basic structure\u2019 of the Constitution of India. \u2014 The Supreme Court has held that the rights to elect and be elected do not enjoy the same status. \u2014 A five-judge constitution Bench in 2006, in the case of Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India held that the right to vote (or the right to elect as it was called) is \u201cpure and simple, a statutory right\u201d. This means that voting is not a fundamental right and can be repealed. \u2014 Section 8 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RP Act) is titled \u201cDisqualification on conviction for certain offences.\u201d Suppose a person is convicted of any of the offences in the exhaustive list provided in the provision. In that case, they will be disqualified from contesting elections from the date of conviction onwards and face further a six-year disqualification from contesting in elections beginning from the date of their release. \u2014 The Election Commission of India (ECI) is empowered under Section 11 of the RP Act to \u201cremove\u201d or \u201creduce\u201d the period of disqualification. In 2019, the ECI used this power to reduce the period of disqualification faced by Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang. \u2014 Another situation where a disqualified MP or MLA can still contest is when their conviction is stayed on appeal to a higher court. \u2014 Section 62 of the RP Act provides a series of restrictions on the right to vote including sub-clause (5) - \u201cNo person shall vote at any election if he is confined in a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or otherwise, or is in the lawful custody of the police\u201d. With an exception provided for those in preventive detention. For Your Information: \u2014 \u2018Postal ballot\u2019 allows voters who cannot be physically present in polling stations to vote remotely, as specified in Section 60 of the RPA. Points to Ponder: \u2014 Can a person who is in prison use a 'postal ballot'? \u2014 Why are free and fair elections important for democracy? \u2014 Why is an accused person allowed to contest an election? What are the concerns related to it? \u2014 What initiatives has the Election Commission taken to increase voter turnout? Post Read Question: Consider the following statements: 1. Electors subjected to preventive detention can use a \u2018postal ballot\u2019 to cast their vote. 2. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is empowered to \u201cremove\u201d or \u201creduce\u201d the period of disqualification. Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 Other Important Articles Covering the same topic: Expert Explains: Special categories of voters, their voting methods The Editorial Page The Heat Stress UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: General issues on Environmental Ecology, and Climate Change \u2013 that do not require subject specialisation. Mains Examination: GS-I, GS-II, GS-III: Important Geophysical Phenomena, Climate Change Environmental Pollution & Degradation, Government Policies & Interventions. What\u2019s the ongoing story- \u201cEven as large parts of the country swelter in a brutally hot summer, with prolonged heat waves, a recently published report shows that rising temperatures is not the sole contributing factor to the heat stress being experienced in urban India. Prerequisites: \u2014 What do you understand by the term \u201cheat stress\u201d? \u2014 What are heatwaves and IMD criteria for declaring them? Key takeaways: \u2014 According to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment, the extreme discomfort of the summer months in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad over the last two decades is caused by a combination of air temperature, land surface temperature and relative humidity, as well as a rapid increase in built-up areas and concretisation. \u2014 Thanks to climate change, temperatures have shot up, as has humidity. But, as the CSE report points out, the effect of this \u2014 the moisture in the air keeps the sweat from evaporating fast enough, making it seem even hotter than it actually is \u2014 is compounded by other factors, including changes in land use and the growing urban sprawl. This has resulted in the \u201curban heat island effect\u201d \u2014 The trapping of heat due to a dense concentration of buildings, paved roads and other surfaces made of materials like concrete, glass and steel, results in higher temperatures in city centres than in the outlying areas\u2026This is a serious cause for concern as the heat stress continues to build, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses and even death. \u2014 All these factors would need to be taken into consideration for relief measures to be effective. While more than 20 states have worked with the NDMA to create heat action plans (HAP), most remain on paper. They are hampered by a lack of funding, granularity and a sustainable vision for transformation. \u2014 There is a growing consensus among experts that city-specific management plans, which take into account local factors, are a far more effective response to heat waves. Such plans should prioritise green spaces and water bodies and target all heat generators, including vehicles, industries and concrete surfaces. \u2014 an example is Ahmedabad\u2019s Cool Roofs programme, which offers an affordable solution for the urban heat island effect. Points to Ponder: \u2014 What are the causes of urban heat island effect? \u2014 What are the impacts of heat stress? \u2014 What are heat action plans (HAP)? \u2014 What measures can be taken to reduce \u201curban heat island\u201d effect? \u2014 What are the heat-related illnesses? \u2014 What measures should be taken to mitigate the impacts of heatwaves? Post Read Question: Bring out the causes for the formation of heat islands in the urban habitat of the world.

UPSC Syllabus: Preliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development Mains Examination: GS-III: Economy What\u2019s the ongoing story- Ishan Bakshi writes: \u201cIn May 2022, the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy committee had held an unscheduled meeting. In it, the committee voted unanimously to raise interest rates by 40 basis points \u2014 this marked the beginning of the rate hike cycle in India. However, the unscheduled nature of the meeting and the policy action had raised several questions.\u201d Prerequisites: \u2014 What is the role of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)? \u2014 What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI)? \u2014 What is headline inflation? \u2014 What is core inflation? Key takeaways: \u2014 \u201cRetail inflation had touched 6.07 percent in February, with both food and core inflation inching upwards. Wholesale inflation had averaged 13.8 percent in the preceding five months, and commodity prices were rising due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\u201d \u2014 \u201cWhat matters for monetary policy is inflation down the line. As per RBI\u2019s own forecast, inflation is expected to average 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024-25.\u201d \u2014 \u201cSo the question is: If India experiences an above-normal, evenly distributed monsoon, and there is greater confidence that food prices, and as a consequence headline inflation, will mirror the trajectory projected by the central bank, then will the MPC cut rates over the course of its next few meetings?\u201d Points to Ponder: \u2014 How MPC controls inflation in the economy? \u2014 What is the difference between expansionary monetary policy and contractionary monetary policy? \u2014 Why does inflation need to be controlled? \u2014 What are the various monetary policy tools?

Raja Mohan writes: \u201cNuclear factors have returned to the top of the agenda in the competitive calculus among major powers as well as in key regional theatres like Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Nuclear energy is also back on the civilian radar as the challenges of managing climate change become acute each year.\u201d Prerequisites: \u2014 India\u2019s nuclear power programme \u2014 What is the role of NATO? \u2014 Which countries in the world have nuclear weapons? Key takeaways: \u2014 \u201cThe Ukraine war in Europe and the Russian rattling of the nuclear sabre are compelling the West to rethink the deterrence dynamic. Strengthening NATO\u2019s nuclear and conventional forces in Europe, greater collaboration between France and Britain (the two European nuclear powers), and building an independent Eurodeterrent under French leadership are some of the ideas that are being explored.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIn the Middle East, regional fears about Iran\u2019s emergence as a nuclear weapon power are intensifying the Arab quest for expanded atomic capabilities of their own.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe rise of AI and robotic weapons is generating questions about the dangers of automating nuclear decision-making and its consequences for strategic stability between the major powers.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt has become commonplace to hear in Delhi that India is no longer bothered about Pakistan and is concentrating its energies on China. While Pakistan\u2019s nuclear challenge continues to simmer, China\u2019s atomic challenge continues to mount.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIf China remains India\u2019s principal security challenge, building deterrent capability against Beijing\u2019s expanding nuclear arsenal should be a national priority.\u201d For Your Information: \u2014 The vital second stage of India\u2019s three-stage nuclear programme got a boost with the commencement of \u2018core loading\u2019 at the country\u2019s first indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. \u2014 Core loading is the process of placing nuclear fuel assemblies inside the core of a nuclear reactor.

Key takeaways: \u2014 India is currently negotiating an FTA with the UK, European Union and a widening deal with Australia. Moreover, with an eye on narrowing the trade gap, the ministry is reviewing a trade deal with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. During the last couple of years, the ministry completed negotiations with UAE, Mauritius and a mini trade deal with Australia. \u2014 Suggestions were made that India should use FTAs to build resilient supply chains, focus on capacity building and interdisciplinary expertise, and adapt to the current trend of partial de-globalisation and geopolitical influences. For Your Information: \u2014 India is facing a systemic problem when it comes to negotiations amid fast-changing contours of trade talks that go beyond traditional areas such as tariffs concessions to labour and environment. \u2014 Experts pointed out that the country\u2019s negotiating strategy cannot rely on transferable generalist civil servants and could need a separate service to handle trade negotiations.

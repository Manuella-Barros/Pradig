The cash promise is doubly confrontational for the IOC, which has severed ties with the International Boxing Association and does not approve of governing bodies paying prize money to Olympic medalists. The IBA said it has a $3.1 million prize money fund for each male and female boxer who reaches the quarterfinals in 13 total weight classes, plus their coaches and national teams. The coach and national team of each Olympic boxing champion will both get $25,000, and the scale of payments goes down to $10,000 in total for each quarterfinalist. The source of the money is unclear but the IBA led by its Russian president Umar Kremlev has been supported by the country\u2019s state energy firm Gazprom. The IBA promised $200,000 for gold medalists at its 2023 world championships and committed to future increases. \u201cAs IBA president, I will always fight for our athletes\u2019 well-being, and this step is consistent in terms of the existing commitments we have already taken,\u201d Kremlev said in a statement. The Olympic body did not support a pledge in April by World Athletics to pay $50,000 prize money to each of the 48 gold medalists in track and field in Paris. It has promised also to pay silver and bronze medalists in 2028 at the Los Angeles Olympics. The IOC has de-recognized the IBA, which will not be involved in organizing bouts in Paris for the second straight Summer Games. The IOC cited its concerns about the boxing body\u2019s governance, reliance on funding from Gazprom, and the integrity of judges and bouts at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Those games were organized when the boxing body was led by a longtime IOC member, C. K. Wu. Paris medalists are set to rewarded at \u201ca special awards ceremony,\u201d IBA said, after \u201csuccessful passing of respective anti-doping procedures.\u201d The IOC was contacted for comment. Prize money to Olympic medalists has traditionally been paid by state governments and national teams though not directly from money sourced to the IOC, which prefers governing bodies invest in developing their sport below the elite level. World Athletics said its $2.4 million prize fund for champions in Paris would come from its share of the IOC\u2019s revenues. Track\u2019s $39.5 million payment for the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021 was the largest amount of a $540 million fund allocated by the IOC. Boxing\u2019s share of Olympic revenues from Tokyo was due to be more than $17 million but was held back by the IOC, which had to oversee running the qualifying and finals tournament bouts. The IBA also will not get money from the IOC\u2019s Paris revenues and a rival organization of national federations, called World Boxing, is being established to become the recognized governing body of Olympic boxing. \u201cWe are setting a clear example for many,\u201d the IBA\u2019s chief executive Chris Roberts said, \u201con how international federations should be treating their champions.\u201d ___ By GRAHAM DUNBAR AP Sports Writer", "summary": "<p>GENEVA (AP) \u2014 The boxing governing body declared rogue by the International Olympic Committee said Wednesday it will pay $50,000&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/olympic-boxing-medalists-in-paris-promised-cash-prizes-by-rogue-governing-body/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Olympic Boxing Medalists in Paris Promised Cash Prizes by Rogue Governing Body</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/olympic-boxing-medalists-in-paris-promised-cash-prizes-by-rogue-governing-body/\">Olympic Boxing Medalists in Paris Promised Cash Prizes by Rogue Governing Body</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/olympic-boxing-medalists-in-paris-promised-cash-prizes-by-rogue-governing-body/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24150361029002-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:20:36", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.0}

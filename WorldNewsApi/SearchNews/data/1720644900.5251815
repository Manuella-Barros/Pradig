{"id": 231340734, "title": "Dick Van Dyke, at 98, Becomes Oldest Daytime Emmy Winner Ever", "text": "Dick Van Dyke became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner ever Friday as the 98-year-old actor was awarded for his guest role on the soap opera Days of Our Lives. \u201cI feel like a spy from nighttime television,\u201d Van Dyke said in his acceptance speech for best guest performer in a daytime drama series. \u201cI\u2019m the oldest nominee in history. I can\u2019t believe it. I was playing old men all my life. If I had known I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself!\u201d 2023 was a surprisingly prolific year for the nonagenarian as he guested on The Simpsons, performed on The Masked Singer, was the focus of a TV special celebrating his legacy, and enjoyed a four-episode arc as amnesiac Timothy Robicheaux on Days of Our Lives, which earned Van Dyke his second Daytime Emmy and first since 1984, Variety notes. The actor has also won four Primetime Emmys, a Grammy, and a Tony, leaving him an Oscar shy of EGOT status. \u201cI\u2019m 98 years old, can you believe it? This tops a lifetime of 80 years in the business,\u201d Van Dyke told the Daytime Emmy Awards audience. \u201cI love you, God bless.\u201d With the victory, Van Dyke tied for oldest person to ever win an Emmy, as legendary TV writer and producer Norman Lear was also 98 when the latter won for outstanding live variety special in 2020. The pair are also tied for oldest people to ever win one of the Big Four (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) awards.", "summary": "\"This tops a lifetime of 80 years in the business,\" actor says after tying Norman Lear for oldest Emmy winner ever", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/dick-van-dyke-oldest-daytime-emmy-winner-1235036067/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156569595.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:02:01", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "authors": ["Daniel Kreps"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.758}

First reported by Ross Dellenger, Snoop Dogg is the new sponsor for the bowl game.\n\nThe full name for the game is going to be the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice, making this a bowl game that is sponsored by an alcohol brand. That's unique among college bowl games, with the Arizona Bowl becoming the first to be sponsored by an alcoholic brand.\n\nIn a video on social media, Snoop Dogg explained his decision to sponsor the Arizona Bowl.\n\n\"College football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, Transfer Portal, and super conferences,\" Snoop Dogg said. \"So, it's time that we get back to the roots of college football when it was focused on the colleges, the players, the competition, the community, the fan experience, and the pageantry.\"\n\n\"Being a fan, coach, supporter of all levels of the game, I sent many players through my SYFL to colleges and the NFL. So, it's only fitting that I step up and help get this thing right. I'm willing to bring the juice back to college football, and I'm taking my talents to Arizona. Believe me, Arizona baby.\"\n\nKym Adair, the executive director of the Arizona Bowl, explained the decision.\n\n\"We are a little different from all the other bowls. We're not afraid to take risks and do things outside of the box,\" Adair said. \"An alcohol brand has always been off the table for us until recently. Everybody in the stadium is drinking a beer or cocktail. It's time for the industry to evolve.\"\n\nThe Arizona Bowl has been played since 2015 and the game's most recent title sponsor is Barstool Sports. While associated with Barstool, the game was streamed on Barstool's website instead of being shown on a traditional network. In 2023, it was available on the CW. However, Dellenger is reporting that in 2024 the game is expected to be played on a traditional network with a more linear distribution.\n\n\"We are the way bowl games used to be,\" Adair said. \"It's allowed us to be entrepreneurial and risk taking. We're able to bring back what I think bowls were originally for, which is a celebration of football and the community. In this landscape, that celebration has been lost and dismissed by people out of touch. For those who think that we don't matter because there's the playoff situation, they don't get it.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg himself has a long connection with football. His son played at UCLA and Snoop himself is a known fan of USC. He even runs the Snoop Youth Football League in Los Angeles to offer opportunities for local inner-city children to play the sport.\n\nPlayfly Sports, a consulting partner for the Arizona Bowl, helped arrange the sponsorship deal with Snoop Dogg.\n\n\"I've sent many players through my SYFL to colleges and the NFL so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" Snoop Dogg told Yahoo Sports. \"With Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop, we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a gameday experience like never before.\"\n\nGin & Juice, a gin-based canned cocktail released earlier this year by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, celebrating the 30th anniversary of Snoop's classic debut album, \"Doggystyle.\"\n\nAs of now, Snoop Dogg is expected to be much more than just the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl. He's also expected to be a part of the game's broadcast and there will be a musical component to the game. On top of that, there are plans for a \"Snooper Bowl\" that will bring together the top California and Arizona youth teams to play as well.\n\nMichael Schreiber, the founder and CEO of Playfly Sports spoke about how important bringing an alcohol brand to the bowl games is going to be.\n\n\"The other part is the activation with an alcohol brand. Alcohol is sold and is allowable at bowl games. There are interesting integrations you can do,\" Schreiber said. \"Look at the Pop-Tarts Bowl. That's amazing work done with the activation of a brand. This is going to be the same in that respect. I think that even the announcement creates an interesting and exciting buzz.\"\n\nEven with changes coming to the bowl system, there is still plenty of excitement around these games and fans do love to watch them. Last season, more than 1.1 million viewers watched the Arizona Bowl on The CW, showing that there is still a major appetite for bowl games. That comes as bowl games are feeling threatened by changes to the College Football Playoff system, opt-outs, and NIL.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_morrison@on3.com", "name": "Dan Morrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_Juice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gin and Juice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop-Tarts Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/06113323/Snoop-Dogg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543560", "eventUri": "eng-9543560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

The game, a 501(c)(3) that donates all revenues to charity, is one of few not either owned or televised on ESPN, something that gives it the flexibility to expand beyond traditional bowl thinking, Adair said.\n\nOne of the game's consulting partners, Playfly Sports, arranged the marriage between the bowl and Snoop Dogg, an avid football fan whose Los Angeles-based Snoop Youth Football League (SYFL) has provided opportunities for more than 60,000 inner-city children over its 18-year existence.\n\n\"I've sent many players through my SYFL to colleges and the NFL so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" Snoop Dogg said in a statement to Yahoo Sports. \"With Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop, we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a game day experience like never before.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg is expected to contribute to the in-game broadcast, will participate in bowl activities leading up to the game and will be featured in a musical component. There are plans for a \"Snooper Bowl,\" where the artist plans to bring the top California and Arizona youth teams together for a battle the week of the game. \"Plus,\" Snoop added, \"we have some surprises coming this year, ya dig.\"\n\nFans should expect to see a halftime or post-game concert and, perhaps, an Impala roll across the football field at some point. The Impala was a featured item in the Gin & Juice rollout earlier this year.\n\nThe Arizona Bowl's leap to prominently partner with a spirits company opens up an entire new category for bowl games, said Michael Schreiber, the founder and CEO of Playfly Sports. According to Playfly's data, gin drinkers at sporting events are 47% more likely to be college football fans versus the general population.\n\n\"The other part is the activation with an alcohol brand. Alcohol is sold and is allowable at bowl games. There are interesting integrations you can do,\" Schreiber said. \"Look at the Pop-Tarts Bowl. That's amazing work done with the activation of a brand. This is going to be the same in that respect. I think that even the announcement creates an interesting and exciting buzz.\"\n\nThe partnership is the latest example of the evolution of bowl games. In an expanded College Football Playoff format and within a new college athlete compensation model, the 35 non-playoff bowl games are striving to market themselves in a different way to remain viable and relevant among detractors. They are rebranding as more fun events that offer players and fans unique experiences originating from warm destinations.\n\nIn an industry that is growing into a serious business, a worrisome trend -- players skipping bowl games -- has emerged as a serious concern for bowl officials.\n\nLast week, Bowl Season director Nick Carparelli said he expects name, image and likeness (NIL) to soon be brought under the school's control and for athletes to sign binding compensation contracts with schools that will require them to play in bowls and CFP games, eliminating or greatly reducing opt-outs. Carparelli spoke to NCAA president Charlie Baker about the topic at a recent meeting.\n\nCarparelli's notion is likely rooted in a new athlete compensation model built around revenue sharing and related to a settlement in the House antitrust case.\n\n\"I think we'll see agreements, much like any other employment agreement between athletes and the university now compensating them, whether it's employee or employer relationship or inducement contractors, and when we see these binding agreements with their student-athletes, you're going to see student-athletes that are required to play in 12 regular season games, the bowl game and the CFP as part of their compensation, not unlike how the rest of the real world works,\" he said.\n\nOpt-outs or not, bowl games remain popular with television viewers. They normally draw more than a million viewers and routinely beat ratings numbers for simultaneous broadcasts of NBA, NHL and college basketball regular season games.\n\nFor instance, last year's Duke's Mayo Bowl, Holiday Bowl, Texas Bowl and Military Bowl all drew at least 2.2 million viewers. No single NBA and NHL game that day eclipsed the 500,000 mark, according to Sports Media Watch.\n\nIn about eight months, the country will have the opportunity to tune into a new game: the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop.\n\n\"We are the way bowl games used to be,\" Adair said. \"It's allowed us to be entrepreneurial and risk taking. We're able to bring back what I think bowls were originally for, which is a celebration of football and the community. In this landscape, that celebration has been lost and dismissed by people out of touch. For those who think that we don't matter because there's the playoff situation, they don't get it.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors":

It's simply immense.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_cluff@azcentral.com", "name": "Jeremy Cluff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_Juice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gin and Juice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brent Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Daily_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Daily Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-American_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mid-American Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2023/08/24/PPHX/70668926007-uscp-7-rnfz-836-svp-1-amthsc-6-o-original.jpg?crop=2999,1695,x0,y283&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543560", "eventUri": "eng-9543560", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-28", "textStart": 2334, "textEnd": 2347}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

This groundbreaking agreement marks the first alcohol partner as the presenting sponsor in an NCAA Bowl Game. Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop is the first ready-to-drink product from Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's new premium spirits company and is named for Snoop's iconic 1994 song from his debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre.\n\n\"I've sent many players through my SYFL to colleges (and the NFL) so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" said Snoop Dogg. \"Dr. Dre and I are excited to bring our brand to the next level with this partnership, and we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a game day experience like never before.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg will promote the new line of premium Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop flavors at the event. In addition to the game, several events will be held in Tucson ahead of kickoff time, including charity events and a SNOOPER Bowl, bringing the top California and Arizona youth football teams to battle it out. As a philanthropist, Snoop Dogg launched the Snoop Youth Football League 17 years ago that has since seen more than 40 kids make it to the NFL. As part of the SYFL, Snoop Special Stars ensures that kids with any physical, mental or developmental disabilities also participate.\n\n\"We are honored to be working with one of our owners, Snoop Dogg, on this incredible event,\" said Patrick Halbert, CEO of Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop. The brand's Chief Strategy Officer, Andrew Gill, continues, \"This partnership was a natural fit for us, and we are excited to be the first alcohol presenting sponsor in a Bowl Game.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled about our groundbreaking partnership with Snoop and Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop,\" said Kym Adair, Executive Director of the Arizona Bowl. \"This year, the Arizona Bowl is bringing sports, libations, and entertainment into a singular bowl game, and we are changing the definition of what a brand partnership is in the NCAA.\"\n\nIn March 2021, the Arizona Bowl formed its partnership with Playfly Premier Partnerships, a division of Playfly Sports, the rapidly growing sports media and marketing agency with expertise in full-service sponsorship sales representation and sponsorship consulting.

Some of the sport's newest bowl sponsors have seen that firsthand in recent years.\n\nPop-Tarts and Duke's Mayo gained a massive amount of exposure by sponsoring bowls this decade. The annual mayo bath after the Duke's Mayo Bowl is already etched among college football's top traditions after only three years, while the Pop-Tarts Bowl mascot's ultimate sacrifice in the first edition of the game set the internet ablaze in December.\n\nThere's nothing college football fans enjoy more than the wild and wacky, even if that means Rob Gronkowski sponsoring a bowl or a coach getting doused in mayo. Snoop Dogg is next to get in on the fun.\n\nHere's a look at Snoop Dogg's new bowl game and how it's connected to a line of drinks produced by the rapper and Dr. Dre.\n\nMORE: The message behind Snoop Dogg's new youth football movie\n\nAlcoholic drink brand Gin and Juice by Dre and Snoop was unveiled as the new sponsor for the Arizona Bowl on Monday. The bowl is officially named the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin and Juice by Dre and Snoop. While it's a bit wordy, the game's new logo emphasizes \"Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl.\"\n\nThe Arizona Bowl isn't a stranger to eccentric sponsors. Barstool Sports sponsored the game for the last three years, but Barstool personality Dan Katz said in December that the partnership was likely to end after 2023.\n\n\"Was a lot of fun doing it but unless the financials drastically change on doing it that's probably it,\" Katz tweeted.\n\nThe Arizona Bowl is played at Arizona Stadium in Tuscon, Ariz., home of the Arizona Wildcats. The conference tie-ins for the game are the Mountain West and MAC. Wyoming defeated Toledo in the 2023 Arizona Bowl, winning 16-15.\n\nThe game already attracted more attention than most bowl games involving smaller conferences thanks to Barstool Sports' large platform, but Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have a chance to bring even more juice to the event with their large followings.\n\nSnoop Dogg isn't the first celebrity to have his name in a bowl game's logo. The LA Bowl was briefly known as the \"Jimmy Kimmel LA Bowl\" in recent years before it became the \"LA Bowl Hosted by Gronk\" after former NFL star Rob Gronkowski took over as a sponsor.\n\nThe LA Bowl might have been the perfect fit for Snoop Dogg, given his connections to Southern California, but Gronkowski's sponsorship deal signed in 2023 is reported to extend multiple years.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best programs of the College Football Playoff era\n\nGin and Juice has a triple meaning, thanks to Snoop Dogg. In the context of the Arizona Bowl, Gin and Juice refers to a line of alcoholic drinks started by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. The company is sponsoring the game, giving the rappers a chance to build its brand in front of a large audience of football fans.\n\nThe company got its name from Snoop Dogg's 1993 song \"Gin and Juice,\" which became one of the legendary artist's biggest hits. Dr. Dre produced the song, which was written by Snoop Dogg.\n\nIt's no surprise the pair adopted the name for their beverage brand. The song gets its name from the gin and juice cocktail, a combination of gin and any form of fruit juice. The song describes \"sippin' on gin and juice,\" which became an iconic line associated with Snoop Dogg despite Snoop not actually singing it in the chorus.\n\nSnoop Dogg is 52 years old. He's set to turn 53 in October.\n\n\"Gin and Juice\" was released more than 30 years ago, but the song became such a hit that the reference still resonates with some younger generations. It's prominent enough that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre named their line of alcoholic drinks in reference to the song, and now the brand will take center-stage at the Arizona Bowl in Tuscon.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke's_Mayo_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke's Mayo Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_Juice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gin and Juice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LA Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop-Tarts Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Tarts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop-Tarts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-American_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mid-American Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-01/snoop-dogg-010722_1ra2qv4m8h2or1n4qlmuqrlohk.jpg?itok=sU9HSqYl", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543560", "eventUri": "eng-9543560", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

I can't wait for our community to welcome them along with the great teams from the Mountain West and Mid-American Conference on Dec. 28th.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg, born Calvin Broadus, hinted his connection to Tucson and the bowl game by posting on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, \"I'm taking my talents (to) Arizona,\" while tagging first-year Arizona football coach Brent Brennan.\n\nBesides hosting concerts in Tucson over the years, Snoop Dogg has also brought youth football teams from Los Angeles to Arizona to face local teams in the Old Pueblo. In 2015, the \"Snoop Dogg All-Stars\" youth football team faced the Tucson Rams at Tucson High; Snoop Dogg attended the UA's home loss to UCLA that weekend.\n\nThe Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop beverage, a canned gin-based cocktail, launched earlier this year to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Snoop Dogg's breakthrough album \"Doggystyle.\" The beverage has four flavors: apricot, citrus, melon and passionfruit.\n\nThroughout the years, the Arizona Bowl has generated close to $150 million in economic impact in Southern Arizona. Since 2019, the bowl game is parlayed with a New Year's Eve celebration in downtown Tucson, also called \"Pechanga Week,\" where a giant taco is dropped at midnight to ring in the new year.\n\n\"The Arizona Bowl is much much more than just a college football bowl game,\" Farhang said in a statement to provided to the Star. \"It was founded to bring our community together in celebration, showcase the best of Tucson and Southern Arizona, create significant economic impact and provide financial support to local nonprofits.\n\n\"This partnership with Snoop Dogg and Gin & Juice takes those priorities to a whole new level. The magnitude of this for our community cannot be understated. This is the biggest sports-meets-pop culture event ever in Tucson, and I think we showed once again that we have a great community where anything is possible and achievable. It's simply immense.\"\n\nThe Arizona Bowl was sponsored by Nova Home Loans for the first five years when it started in 2015. Offerpad was the bowl game's sponsor for one season in 2020, when San Jose State, led by current Arizona head coach Brent Brennan, lost to Ball State in the pandemic-influenced game that had no fans in attendance. Barstool Sports took over sponsorship in 2021, and due to the controversial background of the media outlet's founder, Dave Portnoy, the Pima County Board of Supervisors pulled its $40,000 in funding support for the game. The Barstool Sports Arizona Bowl drew more than 1.1 million viewers on its CW Network broadcast last season, when Wyoming edged Toledo on a walk-off field goal; that game was the third-most watched telecast for the network in the last two years.\n\nBrad Schwartz, president of entertainment at The CW Network, said, \"The CW's first college bowl game in network history served as the centerpiece of eight straight hours of live sports programming.\"\n\n\"Live sports continue to set new ratings milestones for The CW, reinforcing the reach of broadcast television and establishing the network as a premiere destination for free, high-quality games that appeal to all sports fans,\" Schwartz said.\n\nContact Justin Spears, the Star's Arizona football beat reporter, at jspears@tucson.com.

Sports reported Monday. In turn, the Arizona Bowl will now be called the \"Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop.\"\n\n\"We are a little different from all the other bowls. We're not afraid to take risks and do things outside of the box,\" executive director of the Arizona Bowl Kym Adair said in a statement to Yahoo! Sports. \"An alcohol brand has always been off the table for us until recently. Everybody in the stadium is drinking a beer or cocktail. It's time for the industry to evolve.\"\n\nThe bowl game, which is played at Arizona Stadium in Tucson, is relatively young, with the first edition being played in 2015. The Mountain West Conference and the MAC are the confrences who usually send representatives to the game, which was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports.\n\nSnoop Dogg is reportedly expected to partake in the game's broadcast and be featured in a musical element surrounding the game. In addition to the performances, a Chevy Impala could also be incorporated in some way during the bowl game as it's featured on the \"Gin and Juice\" bottle logo. Top youth teams from California and Arizona are also expected to play each other ahead of the bowl game, with those games being called the \"Snooper Bowl.\"\n\nThe 17-time Grammy Award winner has long been active in the youth football scene in Southern California in addition to being a noted football fan. He created the Snoop Youth Football League in 2006, a Los Angeles-based league that has allowed over 60,000 inner-city children in the Los Angeles area to play football since its inception. He's also an avid fan of USC and the Pittsburgh Steelers, and performed in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022 when it returned to Los Angeles to be played at SoFi Stadium.\n\n\"I've sent many players through my SYFL to colleges and the NFL so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" Snoop Dogg told Yahoo! Sports. \"With Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop, we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a game day experience like never before.\"\n\nIt's unclear what other modifications might be coming to the Arizona Bowl. The non-College Football Playoff bowls have undergone some changes in recent years, though, as more and more top players have dropped out of playing in those games.\n\n[CFB official: Paying players could reverse trend of non-Playoff bowl game opt-outs]\n\nAs a result, some bowl games have upped their creativity. The most notable are the Duke's Mayo Bowl and the Pop-Tarts Bowl. In the Duke Mayo's Bowl, the head coach of the winning team has been bathed in Duke's Mayo over the last few years. Meanwhile, the Pop-Tarts Bowl introduced a mascot of a Pop-Tart this past year that was \"edible.\" The winning team gets to eat the large Pop-Tart after the game.\n\nThe mascot for the Arizona Bowl is currently \"Spike,\" who has a football head while wearing eyeblack and a headband.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This groundbreaking agreement marks the first alcohol partner as the presenting sponsor in an NCAA Bowl Game. Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop is the first ready-to-drink product from Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's new premium spirits company and is named for Snoop's iconic 1994 song from his debut album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre.\n\n\"I've sent many players through my SYFL to colleges (and the NFL) so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" said Snoop Dogg. \"Dr. Dre and I are excited to bring our brand to the next level with this partnership, and we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a game day experience like never before.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg will promote the new line of premium Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop flavors at the event. In addition to the game, several events will be held in Tucson ahead of kickoff time, including charity events and a SNOOPER Bowl, bringing the top California and Arizona youth football teams to battle it out. As a philanthropist, Snoop Dogg launched the Snoop Youth Football League 17 years ago that has since seen more than 40 kids make it to the NFL.

The brand's Chief Strategy Officer, Andrew Gill, continues, \"This partnership was a natural fit for us, and we are excited to be the first alcohol presenting sponsor in a Bowl Game.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled about our groundbreaking partnership with Snoop and Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop,\" said Kym Adair, Executive Director of the Arizona Bowl. \"This year, the Arizona Bowl is bringing sports, libations, and entertainment into a singular bowl game, and we are changing the definition of what a brand partnership is in the NCAA.\"\n\nIn March 2021, the Arizona Bowl formed its partnership with Playfly Premier Partnerships, a division of Playfly Sports, the rapidly growing sports media and marketing agency with expertise in full-service sponsorship sales representation and sponsorship consulting. The \"Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented by Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop\" is the second collaboration between Playfly and the Arizona Bowl.

Bowl.\n\n\"Almost 10 years ago, a group of devoted community leaders led by (bowl chairman) Ali Farhang created the Arizona Bowl as a platform to shine a national spotlight on Southern Arizona, create economic impact and provide resources for local charities,\" said Arizona Bowl executive director Kym Adair. \"Today, I think I can speak for the many people that worked tirelessly to grow the Arizona Bowl by saying that today is an incredible day for our community.\n\n\"The Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop will unite music, entertainment, college football and libations in a way that has never been done before. This collaboration is groundbreaking, and I am thrilled to share that we have the most incredible partners a community could ask for in both Snoop Dogg and Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop. I can't wait for our community to welcome them along with the great teams from the Mountain West and Mid-American Conference on December 28th.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, hinted his connection to Tucson and the bowl game by posting on \"X\" on Sunday, \"I'm taking my talents (to) Arizona,\" and tagged Brennan. Besides regularly hosting concerts in Tucson, Snoop Dogg has brought youth football teams from Los Angeles to Arizona to face local teams in the Old Pueblo. In 2015, the \"Snoop Dogg All-Stars\" youth football team faced the Tucson Rams at Tucson High; Snoop Dogg attended the UA's home loss to UCLA that weekend. The Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop beverage, a canned gin-based cocktail, launched earlier this year to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Snoop Dogg's breakthrough album \"Doggystyle.\" The beverage has four flavors: apricot, citrus, melon and passionfruit.\n\nThroughout the years, the Arizona Bowl has generated close to $150 million in economic impact in Southern Arizona. Since 2019, the bowl game is parlayed with a New Year's Eve celebration in downtown Tucson, also called \"Pechanga Week,\" where a giant taco is dropped at midnight to ring in the new year.\n\n\"The Arizona Bowl is much much more than just a college football bowl game,\" said Farhang. \"It was founded to bring our community together in celebration, showcase the best of Tucson and Southern Arizona, create significant economic impact and provide financial support to local nonprofits.\n\n\"This partnership with Snoop Dogg and Gin & Juice takes those priorities to a whole new level. The magnitude of this for our community cannot be understated. This is the biggest sports-meets-pop culture event ever in Tucson, and I think we showed once again that we have a great community where anything is possible and achievable. It's simply immense.\"\n\nContact Justin Spears, the Star's Arizona football beat reporter, at jspears@tucson.com. On X(Twitter): @JustinESports\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

The spirits brand founded by rap icons Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre signed a multiyear deal to sponsor the college bowl game, which will be played Dec. 28.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\n\"I've sent many players through my (Snoop Youth Football League) to colleges (and the NFL), so it's only fitting that I bring the 'juice' back to college football,\" Snoop Dogg said in a statement. \"Dr. Dre and I are excited to bring our brand to the next level with this partnership, and we're going to make the Arizona Bowl into a game-day experience like never before.\"\n\n\"We're thrilled about our groundbreaking partnership with Snoop and Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop,\" said the bowl's executive director, Kym Adair. \"This year, the Arizona Bowl is bringing sports, libations and entertainment into a singular bowl game, and we are changing the definition of what a brand partnership is in the NCAA.\"\n\nThough it's billed as \"the first alcohol partner as the presenting sponsor in a NCAA bowl game,\" perhaps the bigger story is that two rap icons will have their names as part of the branding of the event, even if through their adult beverage. Snoop is the most famous sports fan in rap, as a regular sideline attraction at many NFL games and a planned contributor to NBC's Summer Olympics coverage. There's also his memorable time in the play-by-play booth of the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nAs for Dr. Dre's sports connection, he may not be as much of a fixture among the players and coaches as Snoop, but athletes have prepared and trained while wearing his Beats by Dre headphones -- from his company which Apple purchased outright in 2014 -- for nearly two decades.\n\nThe game itself, played between teams in the Mountain West Conference and the Mid-American Conference, is on its fourth presenting sponsor. NOVA Home Loans branded itself onto the first five editions of the Arizona Bowl starting in 2015. However, the mortgage lender chose not to renew its sponsorship in 2019, paving the way for real estate company Offerpad to take the rights in 2020.\n\nBarstool Sports became the sponsor in 2021. However, citing the platform's numerous controversies, including inflammatory statements from its founder Dave Portnoy, the Pima County Board of Supervisors elected to pull its $40,000 in funding and demanded that the organizers take the county's name off the game's website. While the 2021 game was canceled after a COVID-19 outbreak among Boise State players, Barstool continued its partnership for the last two editions.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is the first booze partner of a bowl game in the modern era. Seven editions of the Bacardi Bowl were played sporadically in Havana, Cuba, between 1907 and 1946, with American college teams taking on Cuban schools or athletic clubs.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_Juice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gin and Juice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barstool_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barstool Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacardi_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bacardi Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Portnoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Portnoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_Broncos_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boise State Broncos football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-American_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mid-American Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beats Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pima County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pima County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Havana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Havana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kB0VF8hsWZqa9a02hFbfCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sportico_165/48f33387122d88a7d0f48c632db3d31a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543560", "eventUri": "eng-9543560", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-28", "textStart": 318, "textEnd": 325}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

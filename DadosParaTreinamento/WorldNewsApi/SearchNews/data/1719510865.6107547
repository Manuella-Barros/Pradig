Tiger King star Joe Exotic just shared his presidential policies with Newsweek, sent from his prison cell after first announcing his transphobia-riddled campaign on social media in 2023. Exotic, who is gay, is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence after being convicted on multiple charges in 2019 \u2013 including two counts of hiring hit men to murder bisexual wildlife activist Carole Baskin. He was also convicted of killing five tigers in 2017 without a veterinarian present. In an exclusive chat with Newsweek on Sunday (26 May), he laid out his views on abortion, gun ownership and LGBTQ+ rights. One key quote saw Exotic explain that while he is openly gay himself, he doesn\u2019t believe that people should \u201cforce it in anyone\u2019s face.\u201d \u201cAs a gay man I don\u2019t agree with everything that the LGBTQ+ community is doing,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to be transgender then pay for the surgery, the government is not going to. And you can sleep with who you want but don\u2019t force it in anyone\u2019s face.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe pride parades with people in G-strings and such is not OK with me while little kids are in the crowd. Put some clothes on and be proud of who you are allowed to love and marry\u2014not how naked you can be in public.\u201d This follows an X (formerly Twitter) post the convicted felon shared on the platform in the run up to Pride month in June, telling Pride-goers to cover up in case \u201clittle kids\u201d see them. Turning his attention away from the moral dangers of G-strings for a minute, he told Newsweek about his bizarre views on gun and abortion rights: \u201cYou can have pro-choice and have the right to [bear] arms, but I am not going to let you have [three] abortions because you are lazy or a slob and can\u2019t put on a condom. \u201cJust like I am not going to let you have a machine gun, but I will go along with one abortion as a mistake and let you have a handgun or rifle.\u201d Joe Exotic\u2019s presidential campaign website Exotic also told Newsweek that running his campaign from behind bars has been tricky, to say the least. In May, reports began to circulate that the Tiger King star\u2019s campaign had been suspended by the FEC (Federal Election Commission), but Exotic responded by telling Newsweek via a voice message that his campaign was \u201cfar from over.\u201d His presidential campaign slogan is currently: \u201cF**k their rules, write me in,\u201d and also #FixThisS**t. According to his campaign website, which features a photoshopped image of Exotic sitting beside a tiger on the White House lawn, his running mate is Thomas Wolf CPA from Ohio, \u201ca Certified Public Accountant and QuickBooks ProAdvisor with over twenty years of experience.\u201d The \u201cpolicies\u201d section of his website includes a policy on the Mattel doll Barbie. It reads: \u201cBarbie is not a very good role model because she is about makeup and glamour instead of teaching young girls to just love themselves for who they are and not what they look like.\u201d Another policy is simply listed as \u201csmoking.\u201d It reads: \u201cI am a smoker and have been for over 40 years, this is another thing that you should be able to decide on your own what you want to do with your own body and I also think as a business owner I should be able to decide which kind of clientele that I want in my business whether they smoke or not smoke and they should have that right to enter on their own risk.\u201d The site also contains a long message from Joe Exotic, which, amongst other things, praises Elon Musk (who he refers to as a \u201cgenius\u201d) and encourages people to \u201cput aside that I am gay, that I am in prison for now, that I used drugs in the past, that I had more then one boyfriend at once and that Carole hates my guts.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Joe Biden and Donald Trump seem set to face off in the upcoming US elections in November 2024, but you might be surprised to find that Biden isn&#8217;t the only presidential candidate called Joe this year.

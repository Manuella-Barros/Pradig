He emphasised that security is not the sole responsibility of the government and urged citizens to collaborate in addressing the issue.\n\nHe encouraged the formation of cooperative societies to facilitate access to farm inputs and other benefits from his administration, promoting self-reliance.\n\nGovernor Alia refuted reports of borrowing substantial sums from foreign financial institutions for infrastructure projects. He explained that awarding the contract for the Sankera-Chito-Vaase road was intended to address the worsening insecurity in the area.\n\nHe disclosed that he had requested President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's assistance in constructing more roads in Sankera. The President approved the construction of the Katsina-Ala Head Bridge-Hausa Quarters/Victory Bible Church Wukari Junction road and the Zaki-Biam Yam Market-Iwar Ior-Y Junction roads. He urged the people to be patient, assuring them of the President's good intentions for the state.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his constituents, Hon. Solomon Wombo, the member representing Ukum, Logo, and Katsina-Ala Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, endorsed Governor Alia for a second term.\n\nWombo stated that the people of Sankera unanimously endorsed the governor for re-election based on his achievements within his first year in office, which he claimed were unprecedented in the state's history.\n\nThe federal lawmaker expressed concern over the escalating insecurity in the area, caused by local militias and armed herdsmen. He appealed to the governor to tackle the problem to enable residents to return to their farms and facilitate Sankera's development.\n\nIn his remarks, Engr Barnabas Gemade, a former gubernatorial aspirant in the party during the 2023 general elections, described Alia's emergence as a divine event.\n\nHe said: \"The priest is a representative of God on this earth, for that reason, if a Priest has been assigned a responsibility he does not need a godfather. A priest that represents God here on earth has no business with another human being calling himself a godfather.\"\n\nGemade, also known as \"Nomiyange\" (a shining bright star), said he recognised that Governor Alia's star shone brighter than his own.\n\n\"So I decided to retreat so as to do no other work but to support him to do things that God Almighty has asked him to do that will bring development to Benue State and he is already doing those things. I have only one thing to tell you the people of Sankera. You must embrace unity and support the Alia's administration to succeed,\" he appealed.\n\nThe Governor's Chief of Staff, Paul Biam, praised the Alia administration's one-year scorecard, claiming it surpassed that of his predecessor.\n\nBiam stated that the Alia administration planned to implement a \"stomach infrastructure\" programme for the people after addressing critical projects, ensuring they feel the impact of governance.\n\n\"After roads and other infrastructural development, the governor will resort to stomach infrastructure and the cries of hunger will be a thing of the past,\" he added.\n\nIn Kwande and Ushongo LGAs, Governor Alia expressed gratitude for the people's support and promised to reciprocate by constructing the Adikpo-Mbape-Ada road to connect the state to neighbouring Cross River State.\n\nHe commended the chairman of Kwande LGA for providing electricity to Adikpo town within a few days in office. However, he expressed concern about the insecurity in the local government, particularly armed herdsmen attacks and illegal mining. He urged traditional rulers to collaborate with authorities to ensure that perpetrators face the full force of the law.\n\nThe acting state chairman of the APC, Mr Benjamin Omakolo, urged continued support for the Alia administration to advance the state's development.\n\nOur correspondent reports that large crowds turned out to welcome the governor, some carrying placards with various inscriptions expressing solidarity with him. Some of the placards read \"The Peoples Governor, Thank you for reconstructing our Roads,\" \"Our Governor, Thank you for bringing our bones back to life,\" \"Dr Hyacinth Alia Zan Zan 2031,\" meaning he will be Governor until 2031.", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For that reason, if a priest has been assigned a responsibility, he does not need a godfather. A priest that represents God here on earth has no business with another human being calling himself a godfather.\"\n\nGemade, also called Nomiyange (shining bright star), said he has seen that Governor Alia came out with his sun which shines more and stronger than his.\n\n\"So, I decided to retreat from doing any other work, but to support him to do those things that God Almighty has asked him to do, which will bring development to Benue State, and he is already doing them. I have only one thing to tell you people of Sankera. You must embrace unity and support Alia's administration to succeed,\" he appealed.\n\nAlso speaking, the Governor's Chief of Staff, Paul Biam, hailed the one year scorecard of the Alia's administration, saying it has surpassed those of his predecessor.\n\nBiam said that the Alia's administration has a programme of stomach infrastructure for the people after critical projects might have been attended to, to enable the people have the feel of the government.\n\n\"After roads and other infrastructural development, the governor will resort to stomach infrastructure, and the cries of hunger will be a thing of the past,\" he added.\n\nIn Kwande and Ushongo LGAs, Governor Alia, who also appreciated the people's support to him, promised to reciprocate the gesture through the construction of the Adikpo-Mbape-Ada Road to link the state to neighbouring Cross River State.\n\nHe commended the chairman of Kwande LGA for lighting up Adikpo town within a few days in office, but lamented the insecurity situation in the local government, especially the armed herdsmen attacks and the illegal mining activities, and tasked traditional rulers to join hands with authorities and ensure that anyone caught would face the full wrath of the law.\n\nThe state acting chairman of the APC, Mr. Benjamin Omakolo, urged the people to continue to support Alia's administration to take the state to the next level of development.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the masses came out en masse to receive him, with some bearing placards that have different inscriptions in solidarity with the governor. Some of the placards read: \"The Peoples Governor, thank you for reconstructing our Roads,\" \"Our Governor, thank you for bringing our bones back to life,\" and \"Dr Hyacinth Alia Zan Zan 2031,\" meaning he will be Governor until 2031 among others.\"", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Click here to subscribe!\n\nForner National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sen. Barnabas Gemade, said he has several reasons to support Gov. Hyacinth Alia of Benue to succeed.\n\nGemade disclosed this on Wednesday in Katsina-Ala while addressing the All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters during Alia's thank you tour accross the state.\n\nRecall that Gemade, who joined the APC in 2014, contested the 2023 governorship ticket alongside the governor and many others.\n\nIt was also recalled that after the primaries, he contested the outcome of the exercise up to the Supreme Court, calling for the cancellation of the exercise over alleged non compliance with electoral guidelines.\n\nThe former senator however, resolved his differences with the governor much later and has since thrown his weight behind him.\n\nSpeaking in Katsina-Ala, Gemade said the coming of Gov. Alia was truly a divine intervention.\n\n\"The priest is a representative of God on earth, for that reason, if a priest has been assigned a responsibility he does not need a godfather. A priest that represents God here on earth has no business with another human being calling himself a godfather.\n\n\"Father Alia can only have a father not a godfather, and I will be very happy as a bonafide son of the state and an experienced man at politics with all that it takes to be a father to anybody, I am very proud to be the father of Rev. Fr.

Fr. Alia came out with his sun which shines more and stronger than mine.\n\n\"So I decided to retreat to make sure I support him to do things that God Almighty has asked him to do, that will bring development to Benue and he is already doing those things.\n\n\"I have only one thing to tell you the people of Sankera. There is nothing more than unity, it is one of the greatest things you must do in this state.

Father Hyacinth Alia has lamented the level of underdevelopment of the state, saying past administrations failed to take the challenge upon them but succeeded in taking the state 40 years backward.\n\nGovernor Alia stated this while addressing a mammoth crowd of Jechira constituency during a visit to thank them for the massive support they gave him that saw his emergence as governor in the 2023 governorship election.\n\nHe said the massive transformation being witnessed in the state today was Divine and intended to write the state's name in the anal of history aimed at returning the state's lost glory.\n\nHe said, \"many years ago, Benue was taken 40 years backward. In between, we had great heroes who came in to do their bit and set the people free. This is one of the reasons God wants you to join forces with great few governors who have demonstrated love for their state and for humanity.\n\n\"For you to co-opt into this administration of ours to bring development and bring our children back to the pedestal that should be in the classroom so that our tomorrow becomes very prosperous and futuristic.\n\n\"What we have done in the area of renovation of schools, hospitals, roads construction, provision of electricity among many others in the last one year was just a tip of the iceberg\".\n\nGovernor Alia commended President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his laudable initiatives aimed at putting the country back on the fast lane of development, stressing that such programmes have direct bearing on the lives of every citizen of the country.\n\nHe noted that such lofty programmes are also targeted at improving the lives of teeming unemployed youths to make them economically viable and employers of labour.\n\nGovernor Alia said as part of his administration's commitment to soak up the unemployment youths in profitable ventures, he has since commenced the training of 10, 000 youth in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), stressing that another batch of 10,000 youths is expected to be trained until 60,000 of them are finally trained.\n\nHe boasted that his administration achieved much in the last four years as evidenced in the construction of several roads, renovation of schools and hospitals, the state Assembly complex, provision of water, electricity and ensuring security to lives and property of people of the state among others.\n\nFormer National Chairman of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), now chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Barnabas Gemade, said the Jechira people in particular and people of the state are solidly behind the government of Alia, whom he said has performed well in the last one year.\n\n\"He (Alia) has performed well, we are in total support of his administration and we are charging all sons and daughters of Jechira that nobody should contest with him in 2027, and he will stand unopposed when the time for second term comes.\n\n\"We have decided to decamp all people from different political parties back to the APC in the state to show that this is the turn of Jechira who are solidly behind their son.\n\nChief Gemade said the governor has a tall scorecard to show for his one year in office describing it as 'amazing'.\n\n\"In fact, his scorecard is better than any governor in Benue State, he is competing with Aper Aku who before now was number one\".", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cephas_iorhemen@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "Cephas Iorhemen", "type":

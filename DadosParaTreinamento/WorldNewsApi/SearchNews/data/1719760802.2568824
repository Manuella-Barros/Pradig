The acclaimed actor is starring in a new series on Netflix called Eric, in which he stars as a puppeteer called Vincent in 1980s New York whose world is shattered when his nine-year-old son goes missing. The drama goes in a surreal direction, as his son\u2019s design for a monstrous-looking puppet called Eric comes to life, following Vincent around as he struggles with substance abuse, a broken marriage and the prospect of never seeing his child again. During a recent conversation with Metro.co.uk, we had to ask him about his past role as Sherlock Holmes in Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat\u2019s acclaimed BBC show, which also starred Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. It\u2019s now been seven years since the finale of season four left fans on tenterhooks and desperately hoping that Sherlock could still return again one day, whether for a fifth season or a film adaptation. So is there a chance that Benedict might fancy throwing back on Sherlock\u2019s trench coat and scarf get-up one day? It\u2019s been seven years since Benedict\u2019s Sherlock was on our screens (Picture: BBC) In Eric, he plays a tortured father grappling with the disappearance of his son (Picture: Ludovic Robert/Netflix) \u2018You won\u2019t hear it here first if there is,\u2019 he answered with a wry smile. And then, a glimmer of hope, as he added: \u2018But we never say never.\u2019 Never say never\u2026 those three words are going to surely fire up Sherlock fans around the globe! This isn\u2019t the first time aficionados of the mystery crime drama have heard that there\u2019s a chance it could return in some form one day. Would you like Sherlock to return for a fifth season or a movie?Comment Now Mark Gatiss recently claimed it was up to Martin and Benedict if Sherlock makes a comeback (Picture: Colin Hutton/Hartwood Films/BBC Worldwide) Just last month, co-creator Mark \u2013 who also played Sherlock\u2019s older brother Mycroft Holmes on the series \u2013 addressed the possibility of a comeback. When asked about the prospect of a fifth season by Deadline, he replied: \u2018Don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll have to ask Benedict and Martin. Are they here?\u2019 The 57-year-old then added: \u2018We\u2019d like to make a film but it\u2019s just very\u2026 Trying to get everyone together is very difficult, so we\u2019ll see.\u2019 Last year, co-creator and former Doctor Who showrunner Steven stated that he would \u2018start writing Sherlock tomorrow\u2019 if Benedict and Martin were to return for another season. The acclaimed actor has played a wide variety of roles in his career (Picture: James Veysey/Rex Features/Shutterstock) \u2018They\u2019re onto bigger and better things but, Martin and Benedict, please come back?\u2019 he said on BBC\u2019s Today programme, as reported by RadioTimes.com. While Benedict\u2019s fans might be waiting with bated breath for him to don his Sherlock cap once more, in the meantime, the actor is starring in the gripping and harrowing new Netflix series Eric. While speaking to Metro.co.uk, he opened up about what it was like to play a character enduring every parent\u2019s \u2018worst nightmare\u2019, when his on-screen son Edgar (Ivan Morris Howe) disappears, given he is also a father in real life. He discussed how as \u2018storytellers\u2019, actors will often do \u2018deep dives\u2019 into the narratives that they\u2019re depicting.

So that does help,\u2019 he explained, referring to how he\u2019s able to distance himself from the subject matter when filming is done for the day. He continued: \u2018For me, it\u2019s also just this character is so sort of\u2026 it\u2019s a very peculiar particular odyssey he goes on and his own struggle and failures and loss of his own child within him that again \u2013 it was shedding that as much as the horror of losing your offspring.\u2019 Eric is due to launch on Thursday June 30 on Netflix. Sherlock is available to watch on BBC iPlayer. Got a story?

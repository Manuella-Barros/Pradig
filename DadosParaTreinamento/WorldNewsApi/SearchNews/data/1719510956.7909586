After Cowie steered County to Premiership safety, with a 6-1 aggregate victory over Raith Rovers in the play-offs, MacGregor confirmed the process of appointing the 41-year-old permanently is already underway. MacGregor revealed that Cowie was informed upon taking the interim reins that he would be given the opportunity regardless of whether County stayed in the top-flight. Cowie says his full focus has been on keeping the Staggies in the top flight, but he now plans to finalise the terms that will see him become the Dingwall club\u2019s new boss. Cowie said: \u201cWhat was said was that the chairman saw me as the person to take this club forward. \u201cWe were aligned in not thinking that needed to be the focus, because we didn\u2019t need any distractions. \u201cOur main focus was on keeping this club in the Premiership. \u201cYou have to have a chat and see how things look. The chairman has shown a lot of belief in me, and he has stated that he sees me being the person to take the club forward. \u201cAt any club you need to have a bigger conversation about how that looks going forward, and we\u2019ll have that. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that I want to be a manager, and I felt I was ready three months ago. \u201cSince then that belief I have in myself has only strengthened, and this is a club I have a lot of affection for, so I don\u2019t see any issues there.\u201d Cowie proud of Staggies\u2019 resolve After coming through two successive play-offs, Cowie is now determined to build on his work ahead of the forthcoming campaign \u2013 which will be the Staggies\u2019 sixth consecutive top-flight season. Cowie, who led the Staggies to memorable home victories over Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian, is proud of the resolve his side have shown to ensure their safety. He added: \u201cWe understand the fight that we have every year. \u201cWe punch above our weight to be in the top league in Scotland, and we embrace that. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging, so there are times you find yourself in the play-of spot, but we need to improve. \u201cThe more you\u2019re down there, eventually you will fall, and it\u2019s up to me now to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe were in a very precarious position when I came into this role. \u201cThe spotlight was on us, and early on we played Livingston where if they beat us we would have been level on points. \u201cI needed calmness, and the football club to come together, and ultimately that\u2019s what has happened. \u201cWe could have missed the play-off, but it wasn\u2019t to be, and the character the players have shown over the last two games makes me really proud.\u201d", "summary": "Staggies chairman Roy MacGregor has confirmed Cowie will become the permanent manager after leading the club to Premiership safety.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/ross-county/6482261/don-cowie-insists-he-is-ready-to-lead-ross-county-after-being-handed-permanent-reins/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/SOCCER_58040739-1hm8pnnl5-scaled-e1716732073406.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:04:27", "author": "Andy Skinner", "authors": ["Andy Skinner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.435}

Coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Bermuda pushing for an equaliser, Ming netted in the 90th minute from close range after excellent work from Kane Crichlow. The 18-year-old said he was too focused on helping his side conjure up a winner in added time to enjoy the special moment. \u201cIt was a nice moment for me \u2013 I was very happy,\u201d Ming told Bernews. \u201cDjair had a flash shot, which was blocked, with Kane reading the funny bounce and crossing the ball first time. \u201cThe ball was slightly behind me, so I took a touch, and it was a tap in. \u201cIt was exciting for me. I was energised about the possibility of the win being back on \u2013 I felt we had something going.\u201d Ming, who came on at right back, admits Bermuda did not make the most of their superior swathes of possession and glut of scoring chances. \u201cIt\u2019s not a horrendous result, but we should have capitalised on our possession and chances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 23 shots to their seven and had 63 per cent of the possession.\u201d Ming and his team-mates had to spend the night at Miami International Airport on Thursday after their flight was cancelled. The team arrived home yesterday morning in preparation to face Honduras at the Flora Duffy Stadium tomorrow [June 9]. \u201cLast night [Thursday] was a rough one \u2013 we had to sleep at Miami airport, which was a minor setback,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re back on track now.\u201d The winger expects Honduras to be the most accomplished team Bermuda face in group A, the Central Americans making a flying start to their second-round campaign, beating Cuba 3-1 at home on Thursday. \u201cHonduras will probably be the best team we face in our group, so we need to come out hard and strong,\u201d said Ming, who has earned a scholarship to NCAA Division I powerhouse Syracuse University in New York. \u201cIf I play, it will be my first Bermuda game in front of a home crowd. We\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d #BermudaFootball #StephenWrightReports Category: All, Sports", "summary": "[Written by Stephen Wright] Sachiel Ming has reflected on his \u201cexciting moment\u201d after scoring his first Bermuda goal to earn them a 1-1 draw away to Antigua and Barbuda in their opening 2026 Concacaf World Cup qualifier on Wednesday [June 5].

At around 3:30 a.m. at East New York and Ralph Avenues in Brownsville, detectives with the Bronx Narcotics squad who were assigned to the Brooklyn neighborhood as part of the NYPD\u2019s summer violence reduction program, watched as a man pointed a gun at a woman in front of a store, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said in a news conference. The detectives were chasing the man on foot when a sergeant and police officer from the same squad drove into the man with their unmarked car, Chell said. \u201cThey tried to cut him off,\u201d Chell said, calling the incident a \u201ccollision.\u201d The man was in surgery as of 6 a.m. Sunday morning with critical injuries, according to NYPD officials. He is expected to survive. \u201cThese detectives were \u2026 exactly where they were supposed to be, and probably prevented a shooting tonight,\u201d Chell said. About an hour earlier in a separate incident in Bushwick, police shot and killed a man in mental distress.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://images-prod.gothamist.com/original_images/00015.JPG\" alt=\"A blue NYPD barrier\" />\n  \n    <p>Police barriers</p>\n  \n\n<p>The man was running from police after two detectives observed him pointing a gun at someone, according to NYPD officials.

The mayor of the nation's capital, Muriel Bowser, has been invited to testify before Congress about her refusal to clear the protest.\n\nUniversity students set up an encampment on GW's campus green on April 25, just over a week after the encampment at Columbia University sprang up. Students have for more than a week flown the Palestinian flag, pitched dozens of tents across the lawn, and vandalized the statue of President Washington at the heart of the university.\n\n\"What is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university's policies. The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property,\" the university president, Ellen Granberg, said in a letter to the GW community on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the university administration asked metropolitan police to clear the protest from the yard on the same day it was set up, though that request was denied by police.\n\nIn her Sunday letter, Ms. Granberg says the DC police are still refusing to clear the protest at her request, though she is in contact with them and they have stationed officers near the encampment. \"We continue to ask for the full support of our partners, including the District of Columbia,\" she said.\n\nMs. Granberg says while she is personally \"grief-stricken\" by the situation at Gaza, there can be no tolerance for illegal protesting on the university's campus.\n\n\"When protesters overrun barriers established to protect the community, vandalize a university statue and flag, surround and intimidate GW students with antisemitic images and hateful rhetoric, chase people out of a public yard based on their perceived beliefs, and ignore, degrade, and push GW Police Officers and university maintenance staff, the protest ceases to be peaceful or productive,\" Ms. Granberg wrote.\n\n\"All of these things have happened at GW in the last five days,\" she continued.\n\nThe university president also says that outside agitators have taken over the protest with the help of students, which puts the GW community at risk. The demonstration has \"been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community's best interest in mind,\" she says. \"It is increasingly unsafe and a violation of university and city regulations to have so many unidentified and unvetted people from outside the GW community living on university property.\"\n\nOne university student told the student newspaper, the GW Hatchet, that the encampment will end once GW divests from Israel. \"We buy into this university, we pay money into this university and we're asking that the university take honest true stance in acknowledging their role in the ongoing genocide,\" GW junior Mahmoud Beydoun told the outlet.\n\nThe DC mayor has been invited to appear before Congress on Wednesday by the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Congressman James Comer. Ms. Bowser and the chief of the metropolitan police, Pamela Smith, have not announced if they will appear before the panel.\n\nMs. Smith told the Hill that she has seen no behavior at the protest that warrants sending in police. \"I think here in the District of Columbia, we allow people the opportunity to have freedom of speech, and that's what we're seeing right now. There has been no violence, no violent behavior, no confrontations,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Many are frustrated that it is continuing; some are willing for it to proceed indefinitely. At GW, our commitment remains to regain and maintain the safety and security of University Yard, pursue accountability for those who have destroyed university property and harassed our community, and return our university to normal operations,\" Granberg said.\n\nShe continued, \"This includes, of course, allowing and promoting the free exercise of various viewpoints and means of expression by members of our community within the limits of university policies. We continue to ask for the full support of our partners, including the District of Columbia, in pursuing these aims.\"\n\nThe university is far from the only one struggling with how to respond to these anti-Israel encampments that have popped up at several colleges nationwide. The protesters have sought to get their universities to meet their demands, which largely include divesting from any weapons manufacturers, Israel, and any company that has ties with Israel.\n\nThere have been instances at these encampments where pro-Palestinian protesters have espoused anti-semitism. Between that and some instances of violence and confrontations between them and pro-Israel counter-protesters, it has made university administrators wary of letting the encampments continue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThere have been instances, as well, where university officials have sought law enforcement's assistance in clearing the encampments, but it has at times resulted in violence as well. At least 25 people were arrested on Saturday at the University of Virginia, according to the New York Times.\n\nNorthwestern University announced last week that it reached an agreement with protesters, which, among other things, reestablishes the Advisory Committee on Investment Responsibility with student, faculty, and staff representation. Brown University announced on Tuesday that it would hold a vote on whether to divest from Israel in October, in exchange for the end of the protesters' encampment.\n\nMultiple political and university leaders, including Granberg, have alleged that outsider agitators have gotten involved in the protests.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brest@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mike Brest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Anthropology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Anthropology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24121585319845.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541561", "eventUri": "eng-9541561", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

She said the encampment is \"potentially dangerous\" and no longer qualifies as a student demonstration.\n\nThe message, which doesn't explicitly ask D.C. officials to clear the encampment, nonetheless calls the protest illegal and places further pressure on the Metropolitan Police Department to clear the demonstration. MPD has reportedly refused to clear it thus far because of concerns over the \"optics\" of clearing a peaceful demonstration, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\"However, when protesters overrun barriers established to protect the community, vandalize a university statue and flag, surround and intimidate GW students with antisemitic images and hateful rhetoric, chase people out of a public yard based on their perceived beliefs, and ignore, degrade, and push GW Police Officers and university maintenance staff, the protest ceases to be peaceful or productive,\" Granberg said in the statement.\n\nIn the last few days, officials have ramped up their condemnation of the encampment with references to escalating tensions at the demonstration.\n\nOfficials said GW Police Department officers were \"forced to withdraw\" from their attempt to prevent protesters from raising a Palestinian flag on a Lisner Hall flagpole Thursday, which they called an \"aggressive act of lawlessness.\" The next day, the University authorized and hung a giant American flag from the roof of Lisner. Students responded that night by projecting an image of President Joe Biden with \"Genocide Joe\" written underneath.\n\nThere have been some verbal altercations among protesters, police, government officials and counterprotesters that have entered the encampment throughout the demonstration. Organizers have repeatedly requested that protesters avoid engaging with counterprotesters and police, frequently responding to counterprotests with chants telling them to leave.\n\nThere have been few reported physical altercations since the encampment began. After GW police allegedly attempted to arrest a demonstrator -- a claim officials denied -- protesters overran the barricades officials erected around the encampment. The coalition said Provost Chris Bracey \"violently attacked\" students when he entered the encampment the same night and appeared to grab a protester's phone.\n\nGranberg said the encampment demonstration, like others on college campuses across the country, has grown into an \"illegal\" occupation of GW property. She said GW's police force \"is, and should only be\" prepared to protect the University during \"normal university operations.\"\n\nShe reiterated that protesters are in violation of University policies and are trespassing in a space reserved for GW Law students during final exams. GW Law Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew said last week that the school offered law school faculty classrooms to relocate their final exams.\n\nThe University's most recent encampment update states exams held in Bell, Corcoran, Lisner and Samson halls and the School of Media and Public Affairs will be relocated.\n\n\"Conventional protests that abide by municipal law and university policy should and do receive protection and respect, no matter the message's viewpoint,\" Granberg said in the statement. \"As I have outlined, this is not what is happening at GW.\"\n\nOne of the coalition's demands, which organizers said Granberg has refused to address, is the protection of pro-Palestinian speech on campus. Students have repeatedly said GW censors pro-Palestinian speech and silences student activism. They point to officials' suspension of Students for Justice in Palestine in November for projecting messages critical of Israel and GW onto Gelman Library and the University's response to other protests as evidence of \"a long history of racist student repression.\"\n\nGranberg said the presence of unidentified and \"unvetted individuals\" living on campus property is \"unsafe\" and a violation of University and D.C. regulations. She said these individuals don't have the community's \"best interest in mind.\"\n\nThe coalition that began the encampment included students from eight schools across the D.C. region. In the protest's 11 days, organizers from a handful of local advocacy organizations have visited to rally or make speeches.\n\nIt's unclear how many of the demonstrators, many of whom hide their identities due to fear of doxxing and harassment, are unaffiliated with GW, but a majority appear to be students. An organizer declined to state how many demonstrators are in the encampment during a press conference Sunday afternoon, citing concerns for demonstrators' safety.\n\nThe message is Granberg's third statement on the pro-Palestinian encampment in U-Yard that students from local universities began 11 days ago to call for an end to the war in Gaza, demand their schools divest from companies supplying weapons to Israel, end academic partnerships with Israel and drop student conduct charges against students. It's her first message not co-signed by Bracey.\n\n\"There is a dire humanitarian crisis occurring in Gaza that must be addressed, and I am personally grief-stricken by the suffering and loss of innocent lives occurring on both sides of this conflict,\" Granberg wrote. \"I fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues -- as long as they occur within the limits of our University's policies and the District's laws.\"", "source": {"uri": "gwhatchet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The GW Hatchet"},

I fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues -- as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the District's laws,\" Granberg's statement said. \"However, what is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university's policies. The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property.\"\n\nGranberg also said that the protest is no longer a student demonstration adding that it has been absorbed \"by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community's best interest in mind.\"\n\n\"We have offered an alternative demonstration site, requested the assistance of the DC Metropolitan Police Department, erected barriers to contain the protest, initiated academic and administrative consequences for trespassing GW students, expanded our security resources and personnel, and conducted regular and sustained dialogues with GW students connected to the camp,\" Granberg continued. \"So far, all of these efforts have failed to end the encampment or deter the protesters from escalating the situation.\"\n\nShe said the university is not equipped to handle the situation and must \"rely on the support and experience of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.\"\n\nThe demonstrations began on April 25. Since around the same time, colleges and universities around the country that have seen dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests at demonstrations over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nDear Members of the George Washington University Community,\n\nIt has been over a week since a group of students established an unauthorized protest encampment on GW's University Yard. Since then, there have been many conversations about students' rights to free expression and assembly and whether this is a peaceful protest. In this message, I want to directly address those conversations, share what we are experiencing on campus, and outline our desired outcomes moving forward.\n\nBefore I begin, I want to make clear that I believe the issues at the heart of this protest are important and deserve our full attention and consideration. There is a dire humanitarian crisis occurring in Gaza that must be addressed, and I am personally grief-stricken by the suffering and loss of innocent lives occurring on both sides of this conflict. I fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues -- as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the District's laws. However, what is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university's policies. The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property.\n\nHistory has repeatedly shown that there are many effective ways for communities to express their differing viewpoints lawfully within the District of Columbia. In the last seven months alone, at GW, we have seen this play out on all sides of the war between Israel and Hamas. I know that some in our community and others across the country argue that this, too, is simply a peaceful protest - and, at certain times, this has been true. However, when protesters overrun barriers established to protect the community, vandalize a university statue and flag, surround and intimidate GW students with antisemitic images and hateful rhetoric, chase people out of a public yard based on their perceived beliefs, and ignore, degrade, and push GW Police Officers and university maintenance staff, the protest ceases to be peaceful or productive. All of these things have happened at GW in the last five days.\n\nIt is also essential to highlight that at no point was this encampment lawful. From the moment GW students declared their intent to establish an encampment on University Yard, they were in direct violation of multiple university policies and were trespassing on a space explicitly reserved for the GW Law final examinations. The university, which is committed to protecting our students' rights to free expression, informed them of this and quickly offered a secure alternative protest site where GW would support them in holding peaceful daytime demonstrations. This offer was repeatedly refused.\n\nFinally, it is clear that this is no longer a GW student demonstration. It has been co-opted by individuals who are largely unaffiliated with our community and do not have our community's best interest in mind. It is increasingly unsafe and a violation of university and city regulations to have so many unidentified and unvetted people from outside the GW community living on university property.\n\nConventional protests that abide by municipal law and university policy should and do receive protection and respect, no matter the message's viewpoint. As I have outlined, this is not what is happening at GW.\n\nFor these reasons, the George Washington University continues to tirelessly pursue every avenue available to resolve the situation swiftly and safely. We have offered an alternative demonstration site, requested the assistance of the DC Metropolitan Police Department, erected barriers to contain the protest, initiated academic and administrative consequences for trespassing GW students, expanded our security resources and personnel, and conducted regular and sustained dialogues with GW students connected to the camp. So far, all of these efforts have failed to end the encampment or deter the protesters from escalating the situation.\n\nAs a university, we are not equipped to single-handedly manage an unprecedented situation such as this. The GW police force is, and should only be, prepared to protect our community during normal university operations and to respond to routine and urgent incidents. When unlawful activities go beyond these limits, we must rely on the support and experience of the DC Metropolitan Police Department. At this time, the District is in communication with the university, and the DC Metropolitan Police are providing an increased security presence on and around University Yard.\n\nI understand and fully share the deep concern many feel about the status of the protest. Many are frustrated that it is continuing; some are willing for it to proceed indefinitely. At GW, our commitment remains to regain and maintain the safety and security of University Yard, pursue accountability for those who have destroyed university property and harassed our community, and return our university to normal operations. This includes, of course, allowing and promoting the free exercise of various viewpoints and means of expression by members of our community within the limits of university policies. We continue to ask for the full support of our partners, including the District of Columbia, in pursuing these aims.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melanie_alnwick@fox5dc.com", "name": "Melanie Alnwick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_school", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normal school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University Law School"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Anthropology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Anthropology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1280/720/54447290-GWProtest-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541561", "eventUri": "eng-9541561", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1994, "textEnd": 2002}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Granberg, president of The George Washington University in D.C., is starting to discover her chickens are coming home to roost after more than one week of university inaction allowed a pro-Hamas encampment to take over a swath of campus.\n\nTownhall reported from the site of the encampment on its first day as dozens then hundreds of agitators chanted \"the intifada is here\" and issued other calls for the murder of Jews and elimination of Israel.\n\nThat first day, the university warned those setting up tents that they were in violation of school policy and must be moved to another location. GW also noted that overnight camping is not allowed and demonstrators would need to remove themselves and their tents by 7:00 p.m.\n\nTownhall was there as 7:00 p.m. turned into 10:00 p.m. The pro-terrorist goons were still there, their horde growing in number. Not only did they not move from the area they weren't allowed to be in, they never dispersed. For hours, GW administrators stood at the margins of the antisemitic demonstration. Appearing unconcerned with the vile chants emanating from the center of their supposedly elite campus, the \"adults in the room\" milled about chatting and laughing with each other.\n\nUnsurprisingly, once the organizers of the Hamas Youth Campout realized the university predictably (no less shamefully) was not going to do anything to enforce the rules, the crowd grew. The pro-terrorist agitators raised the Palestinian flag over the lawn on which they camped. Outsiders joined the student agitators. The encampment even established its own dystopian \"People's Tribunal\" to declare the guilt of administrators -- including President Granberg -- and call for their summary execution by \"guillotine.\"\n\nNow suddenly, and after day after day of inaction, GW's president is lamenting the state of things and begging for help because things on campus have become \"increasingly unsafe\" as if it wasn't clear from the start that the situation would deteriorate.\n\nIn a letter posted to the school's website, President Granberg did the usual equivocating about the \"dire humanitarian crisis occurring in Gaza\" and how she's \"personally grief-stricken by the suffering and loss of innocent lives occurring on both sides of this conflict.\"\n\n\"However, what is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university's policies,\" Granberg's letter continued. \"The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property.\" That's tough talk for someone who did not care enough to do anything until about five minutes ago.\n\nOutlining the chaos that has occurred on her campus, Granberg lamented the current situation that has seen \"protesters overrun barriers established to protect the community, vandalize a university statue and flag, surround and intimidate GW students with antisemitic images and hateful rhetoric, chase people out of a public yard based on their perceived beliefs, and ignore, degrade, and push GW Police Officers and university maintenance staff.\"\n\nAll that, according to Granbeg, means \"the protest ceases to be peaceful or productive.\" Odd that it was unproblematic to Granberg -- and in fact \"productive\" -- for her to tolerate students flagrantly violating school policies and chanting their desire for Jews to be murdered for days before all the naturally outflowing violence grew to be too much.\n\nGranberg herself admits the weakness she and the school displayed that allowed the situation to escalate:\n\nIt is also essential to highlight that at no point was this encampment lawful. From the moment GW students declared their intent to establish an encampment on University Yard, they were in direct violation of multiple university policies and were trespassing on a space explicitly reserved for the GW Law final examinations. The university, which is committed to protecting our students' rights to free expression, informed them of this and quickly offered a secure alternative protest site where GW would support them in holding peaceful daytime demonstrations. This offer was repeatedly refused.\n\n\"This offer was repeatedly refused,\" by students, just like the Hamas terrorists they glorify have repeatedly refused ceasefire offers.\n\nFor now, though, GW is still allowing the pro-terrorist camp to continue -- claiming it is \"not equipped to single-handedly manage an unprecedented situation such as this.\" Well, this was started by GW's students. GW failed to enforce the policies that made the encampment illegal from the start. GW failed to better train its students in the ideas of tolerance and decency. And now it reaps a plentiful harvest.\n\nGranberg says that GW \"must rely on the support and experience of the DC Metropolitan Police Department,\" but the camp still stands. Saying the school's \"commitment remains to regain and maintain the safety\" of the yard pro-terrorist students have seized,\" she pleads for \"the full support of our partners, including the District of Columbia.\" That is, after allowing an illegal camp to be set up and failing to enforce school policies for weeks, GW now needs bailing-out from a crisis of its own creation.\n\nBut the District, helmed by Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser and an even more radical city council, did not show interest in shutting down illegal, violent protests in the summer of 2020. So far, D.C. has not shown any more interest in removing the violent pro-terrorist agitators from GW.\n\nShame on these students and outside agitators who've joined them -- and shame on The George Washington University for putting its willfully feckless incompetence on display.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We're here to share our MLB odds series, make a Cardinals-Brewers prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nThe Cardinals are struggling this season. Ultimately, they lost four in a row before their series finale with the New York Mets was postponed due to inclement weather. They even somehow lost two of three games to the Chicago White Sox. Now, they begin a road trip, the first stop being Wisconsin, to face the Brewers.\n\nThe Brewers ended a three-game losing streak on Tuesday. Before heading home, they played a finale on Wednesday with the Kansas City Royals. They hope to continue their success against the Cards.\n\nThe Brewers swept the Cardinals last month, taking all three games in St. Louis. Significantly, they won 2-1, 12-5, and 2-0. The Brew Crew hopes to keep the momentum going.\n\nLance Lynn was originally supposed to make a start. However, the game postponement means Sonny Gray will likely make the start instead, pushing Lynn back to Friday. Gray is 4-1 with a 0.89 ERA. Recently, he tossed a gem, throwing seven shutout innings while striking out six against the Chicago White Sox.\n\nTobias Myers makes the start for the Brewers. He is 0-2 with a 6.23 ERA. Unfortunately, he lasted just three innings in his last outing, giving up four earned runs on three hits while walking four and striking out two in a loss to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nTV: Bally Sports Wisconsin and Bally Sports St. Louis\n\nThe Cardinals are just 27th in batting average, 25th in on-base percentage, and 28th in runs. Also, they are only 29th in home runs and 28th in slugging percentage. Their hitters are just not doing enough.\n\nWillson Contreras is hitting just .222 with 14 home runs, 46 RBIs, and 47 runs over 108 games against the Brewers. Yet, he is 3 for 9 with an RBI and one run against the Brew Crew this month. Paul Goldschmidt is hitting .297 with 27 home runs, 84 RBIs, and 82 runs through 124 games against the Brewers. Sadly, he has struggled this season, batting .167 (2 for 12) with an RBI over three games.\n\nNolan Arenado has 22 home runs, 63 RBIs, and 58 runs over 78 games against the Brewers in his career. Yet, he went 2 for 9 in the series against the Brewers last month, knocking a double for two RBIs. Nolan Gorman was even worse, going 0 for 9 with six strikeouts. Overall, the Cardinals left 12 runners on base in the first game, nine in the second, and 10 in the finale.\n\nThe Cardinals will cover the spread if their hitters can find ways to bring runs home. Then, they need Lynn to toss a quality start.\n\nWhy The Brewers Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Brewers are seventh in batting average, fourth in on-base percentage, and 10th in runs. Additionally, they are sixth in home runs and fifth in slugging percentage. Their hitters are clobbering the baseball and look to keep it up.\n\nWilliam Contreras (Willson's brother) is batting .249 with 15 home runs, 47 RBIs, and 42 runs over 95 career games against the Cardinals. Also, he is hitting .333 with one home run, five RBIs, and six runs over his last 10 games against the Cards. Rookie Jackson Chourio went 2 for 10 against the Cardinals last month, clubbing one home run, two RBIs, and two runs.\n\nWilly Adames is hitting .250 with five home runs, 16 RBIs, and 14 runs over 40 games against the Cardinals. Likewise, Rhys Hoskins is batting .298 with seven home runs, 11 RBIs, and 20 runs over 27 games against the Cards. Hoskins also went 2 for 8 with one home run, three RBIs, and one run over two games against the Cardinals last month.\n\nThe Brewers will cover the spread if the hitters can find ways to hit Lynn and force him off his game. Then, they need good pitching from Myers.\n\nFinal Cardinals-Brewers Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Brewers absolutely dominated the Cardinals last month. However, Lynn did not pitch a game. Look at what he has done in his career against the Brewers. Significantly, he has been consistently good against Milwaukee. Expect Lynn to pitch a good game, finding ways to confuse the Brewer hitters. Subsequently, he will do enough to lead the Cardinals to victory. This feels like a 4-3 Cardinals win in the making. The Cardinals cover the spread.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While the Brewers were expected to take a step back after losing players like Corbin Burnes, the Cardinals were hopeful a fresh corps of starters and offensive bounce backs could lead to contention.\n\nInstead, the Brewers have a chance to build on their early standing in the division while adding to the Cardinals' struggles. The Cardinals' 15-21 record leaves them sitting six games behind the Brewers. Their inability to match other competitive teams has been a notable narrative during their season with a 7-14 record against teams with at least a .500 winning percentage.\n\nAfter the team's hot start, the Brewers have played to a fairly middling pace over the last two weeks. Entering play on Wednesday, Milwaukee ranked 14th in runs scored and 17th in ERA over the last 15 days. That's hardly a bad omen, but it shows the recent struggles to build on their dominant start. Although the squad has scuffled offensively, there is still an abundance of lineup options to work through any issues.\n\nEven though the Brewers have slowed from their torrid pace, the problems in St. Louis are much more magnified. The offense hasn't come close to resembling the blueprint that the Cardinals would have had upon the start of the season. Over the past 30 games, St. Louis ranks 28th in runs scored while averaging a mere 3.2 runs per game. A recent injury to Willson Contreras will sting the Cardinals even more as he was their only hitter performing at an All-Star level. Players to watch in his absence include Alec Burleson and Nolan Arenado, who have both found some form in recent weeks.\n\nThe pitching for St. Louis has been better than last season, but not good enough to carry the team through their offensive slump. The three big additions to their rotation have performed more than well enough to keep the team competitive, but the lineup hasn't held up its end of the bargain. Sonny Gray (0.89 ERA) has continued his Cy Young form from last season. Lance Lynn (3.28 ERA) and Kyle Gibson (3.68 ERA) have been solid, but their underlying numbers hint towards that production possibly regressing in the future.\n\nThursday, May 9 @ 6:40 p.m: Tobias Myers (6.23 ERA) vs. Sonny Gray (0.89 ERA)\n\nThe Brewers most difficult test of the series will come in Game 1 as they face down Sonny Gray. The runner-up in last year's Cy Young race, Gray has continued right where he left off. Not only is his 0.89 ERA a stunning statistic, but he's pitched even better than his exceptional 2023 campaign.\n\nHe is striking out batters at a career-high rate. Batters can't square up his pitches, with just a 29.6% hard-hit rate allowed. His two breaking balls have been untouchable. His curveball and sweeper have allowed batting averages of just .133 and .138, respectively. He's been one of the best pitchers in baseball over the past year and one of the few highlights of this Cardinals season.\n\nTobias Myers has stumbled out of the gates in his rookie season, so it will be fascinating to see how he attacks this Cardinals lineup. Myers' 6.23 ERA doesn't offer much for encouragement, but there is still plenty of room for growth. He has succeeded at getting batters to chase out of the zone, but he has had problems with his cutter. As he adapts his approach and pitch mix, his development will be an interesting storyline.\n\nFriday, May 10 @ 7:10 p.m: TBD vs. TBD\n\nSaturday, May 11 @ 7:10 p.m: Freddy Peralta (3.49 ERA) vs. Kyle Gibson (3.68 ERA)\n\nFreddy Peralta has been ace-adjacent this year, but he hasn't lived up to the standards he would set for himself. His first four starts were excellent, but his three most recent outings have left something to be desired. He didn't make it through six innings in any of those games while allowing a 6.00 ERA.\n\nPeralta is still one of the most dominant strikeout pitchers in baseball, so his dip in production is likely to be a short-term issue. He is in the 91st percentile in strikeout rate and his slider has allowed a .050 batting average- which seems like it's hardly a real number. He has allowed more damage on his fastball, but Peralta is more than capable of making the adjustments necessary.\n\nKyle Gibson has some terrible expected stats (5.44 xERA) but has continued to find success with a high groundball rate. He has stranded runners at a high clip this year even as his strikeout rate has dipped to his worst since 2016. Another pitcher for the Cardinals without elite velocity, Gibson has found success with a variety of breaking balls and offspeed pitches. His sweeper has allowed more hits this year, but he has forced a 41.2% whiff rate on the pitch.\n\nHis ability to mix-and-match with a variety of pitches has helped his sinker play up without needing to blaze past hitters. Lefties have had a particularly difficult time against Gibson this season with a .212 batting average. Just like Lynn, though, Gibson has been prone to hard contact.\n\nSunday, May 12 @ 1:10 p.m: Bryse Wilson (2.40 ERA) vs. TBD\n\nBryse Wilson has been one of the most unexpected breakouts of the season for Milwaukee. His 2.40 ERA has been a boon to the pitching staff, but his path to get to this point has been funky. In 2022, he pitched a career-high 115 / innings with the Pirates with a 5.52 ERA. He moved to the bullpen when he came to Milwaukee, lowering his ERA to 2.58.\n\nAs this season developed, Wilson morphed once again into a starter, but has been excellent this time around. He's now providing length and limiting damage. Over his last three starts, he has pitched to a 1.65 ERA while pitching six innings in his recent two outings. He allowed just eight hits in that time but needs to reduce the walks allowed to avoid more traffic. He doesn't have an elite wipeout pitch, but his four primary pitches all have whiff rates over 20%. His performance has been unexpected, but his continued results will be a welcome sight in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers should be able to add to the Cardinals' misery in this four-game showdown. Pitchers like Lynn and Gibson have been able to pitch to a low ERA so far, but it seems like a potentially combustible mix for the Cardinals if the Brewers can put together competitive at-bats throughout the entirety of the lineup. Not only is it potentially a get-right series for many of the Brewers hitters, but the St. Louis offense has played poorly this season. The Brewers could see several hitters break out of a slump, just as the Cardinals unfortunately lost their best hitter in Contreras. Although a four-game sweep isn't out of the question, the Brewers have a chance to confidently take three out of four.", "source": {"uri": "brewcrewball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brew Crew

Over their last two series, Milwaukee is hitting just .221 with a .664 OPS, and it wouldn't be shocking to see that trend continue against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nVeteran right-hander Sonny Gray has been a bright spot for St. Louis this season, pitching to a 2.33 expected ERA while limiting opponents to a 2.08 expected batting average. That includes limiting this same Brewers lineup to two runs on five hits while striking out 12 in 6 1/3 innings back on April 2.\n\nAll the while, St. Louis is one of the worst-hitting teams in baseball this season, ranking 28th in batting average, 27th in OPS, and 25th in wRC+. Even a matchup against rookie hurler Tobias Myers has me wary of what they can accomplish.\n\nFor those reasons, I'm turning my attention to the total. The Brewers swept the last series in St. Louis, but two of those games went way below the total, and I expect tonight's contest to follow suit.\n\nLet's double down on Sonny Gray being successful tonight, as the right-hander is limiting opponents to a .194 batting average and giving up just 6.2 hits per nine innings. Gray has also not allowed more than five hits in a start and has held opposing teams to four or fewer in three of his five starts.\n\nNootbar also hit .271 with a .835 vs. right-handed pitchers last season. Considering Myers is surrendering a .869 OPS to opponents so far, I like Noot to keep trending in the right direction this evening.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Cardinals have hit the game total Under in 9 of their last 11 away games (+6.85 Units / 57% ROI).

Contreras will need more than the minimum 10 days as the 31-year-old backstop suffered a broken left forearm during Tuesday's game against the Mets. Contreras was struck by a swing from J.D Martinez that collided with the middle of the forearm and carried through to his wrist. He'll have to undergo surgery and is expected to miss at least six to eight weeks. In the meantime, Iv\u00e1n Herrera and Pedro Pag\u00e9s will handle catching duties while Contreras is sidelined.\n\nTurang collects three hits in loss\n\nBrice Turang went 3-for-4 with an RBI on Wednesday in the Brewers' loss to the Royals. Turang capped off a three-hit performance with a run-scoring double off Royals reliever Tyler Duffey in the ninth inning, but wound up being stranded in scoring position representing the potential tying run. The 24-year-old speedster has made the most of his opportunity this season, emerging as Milwaukee's everyday second baseman, posting an .826 OPS with two homers and 14 steals through 34 contests so far.\n\nCardinals vs. Brewers MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 17 of St. Louis' last 23 games against Milwaukee\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 8 of St. Louis' last 11 games on the road\n\nOver/Under has gone UNDER in 10 of Milwaukee's last 12 games when playing at home against St. Louis\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 8 of Milwaukee's last 11 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nCardinals vs. Brewers MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake Milwaukee.

Two innings later, Christopher Morel took him deep as well.\n\nThree career MLB starts, three first-inning home runs and five overall -- in just 13 innings pitched.\n\nIt follows an eight-year minor-league career that saw Myers give up 83 home runs, including 30 last year at Double-A Biloxi.\n\nIn his three big-league starts, he's been able to attack the zone and strike out a few hitters, but his command hasn't been great, especially in his last start against the Cubs.\n\nMyers is only 25 despite being in the minor leagues since 2016. Even if his stay is a short one in Milwaukee (he's been filling in on an injury-plagued staff), he fits right in with the Brewers, who have made a movement toward youth this season.\n\nSt. Louis, on the other hand, went into the year counting on several players on the downside of their careers. So far, those veterans haven't shown much, especially on offense.\n\nThe Cardinals as a team have slashed .218/.296/.340 for an OPS of .636. All four of those stats sit in the bottom five among the 30 MLB teams.\n\nCatcher Willson Contreras was the one player holding his own, but now he's on the injured list after suffering a fractured arm in a freak play against the Mets on Tuesday.\n\nLast year, the Cardinals hit 209 home runs, which finished in the top third of the entire league. The power numbers are way down in 2024, however, as their 26 deep shots are only one more than the last-place White Sox.\n\nContreras would have been a natural to extend Tobias' streak to four games of giving up a home run. Before landing on the IL, he was batting .280 and leading St. Louis with six homers, including four in his last 13 games.\n\nArenado is showing serious signs of slowing down at age 33, especially with his power, which has fallen off a cliff. His hard-hit and barrel rates are way down, and his expected metrics say it's not likely to improve much going forward, if at all.\n\nHowever, he has killed the Brewers over the years with 22 home runs and a career slash line of .307/.381/.617. He especially loves the park currently called American Family Field, where he's hit six home runs over the past three seasons.\n\nWhile all HR bets are risky, if you assume Myers is going to serve one or more up again, why not sprinkle some change on a player who has always hit Milwaukee hard and still hits cutters at an elite rate.\n\nMyers, who throws his cutter 25% of the time, has been hit hard on the pitch, serving up two of his five homers this season on it.\n\nSonny Gray, who gets the start against the Brewers after Wednesday's postponement with the Mets, has only given up three earned runs this season, only one in the first five innings.\n\nHe did give up two runs in a 2-0 Brewers win last month, but both runs were given up in the seventh inning -- the third time through Milwaukee's order.\n\nMyers' early struggles are well-documented above.\n\nWhile we're expecting a clean first from Gray, Myers' first-inning jitters appear to only be getting worse.\n\nAgainst the Cubs last week, he followed up the homer to Hoerner with four consecutive walks. Somehow he got out of the inning with just two runs plated.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gray's ERA through his first five starts with the club is the lowest by a Cardinal pitcher since 1910.\n\nGray's only loss this season, however, came against the Brewers on April 21. He allowed two runs on five hits in 6 1/3 innings despite striking out 12 and walking one.\n\nGray originally was slated to start Wednesday, but the Cardinals were rained out at home in what would have been the series finale against the New York Mets. St. Louis lost to the Mets 7-5 on Tuesday when New York scored six runs in the fifth inning.\n\nCardinals manager Oliver Marmol said, according to MLB.com, regarding his upcoming rotation plans, \"I'm going to sit down and figure out how we want to look at the next four days and then even beyond the four days from a player standpoint.\"\n\nSt. Louis has lost four straight, and the Tuesday defeat was especially costly when catcher Willson Contreras sustained a fractured left forearm fracture after being hit on swing by J.D. Martinez. Contreras was placed on the 10-day injured list Wednesday, with catcher Pedro Pages recalled from Triple-A Memphis. Contreras was hitting .280 with a team-high six homers.\n\nThe Brewers lost at Kansas City 6-4 on Wednesday, their fourth defeat in their past five games. Milwaukee managed just one run through 5 1/3 innings against Royals starter Brady Singer.\n\nMilwaukee received a boost before the game when outfielder Christian Yelich was activated from the injured list. Yelich, who missed the 23 previous games with a back ailment, was hitting .333 with five homers before his injury. He was hitless in five at-bats as the designated hitter in his return.\n\nGray tossed seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits, in his latest start, a 3-0 win over the Chicago White Sox on Friday. He has yet to allow a run in the first four innings of any start this season.\n\n\"The ERA is one of the reasons, but what he does in wanting everybody to be good is bring those guys alongside of him, he's really good at all of that,\" Marmol said after Gray's last start.\n\nGray is 4-4 with a 2.82 ERA in 14 career starts vs. Milwaukee.\n\nMyers lasted just three innings in his most recent start, allowing four runs, three hits, two homers and four walks in a 6-5 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Saturday.\n\n\"Command wasn't that good,\" Myers said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, after that outing. \"Nothing really felt great coming out. Adjusted a couple things in my delivery. Definitely something we can work on moving forward.\"\n\nMyers, who made his major league debut on April 23 against the Pittsburgh Pirates after eight seasons in the minors, has given up five home runs in 13 innings.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Singer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brady Singer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez took a swing and his bat dropped down and hard into Contreras' forearm. Contreras, who was scheduled to undergo surgery Wednesday, said he expects to be out six to eight weeks. The team has not yet provided a timeline for his return. Updated May 8\n\nGiovanny Gallegos (right shoulder impingement): The righty went on the the 15-day injured list Monday, a day after manager Oliver Marmol said he \"doesn't look right.\" He has been ineffective this season and his fastball velocity has dropped into the low-90s. There is no set timeline for Gallegos' progression toward a return. Updated May 6\n\nSteven Matz (lower back stiffness): The lefty went on the 15-day injured list on Friday with a lower back injury. Matz began experiencing soreness following a start, and during his start April 30 he had a sag in velocity and effectiveness. Manager Oliver Marmol indicated the team thought it would be a shorter IL stint. Updated May 3\n\nTommy Edman (wrist surgery): On the 10-day IL, Edman took swings off a tee from both sides of the plate in late April. He had been limited to hitting only from the right side, but recently advanced without any soreness. His hitting progression will be per usual (coach pitch, then a pitching machine) as tolerated. On May 6, he was moved to the 60-day IL. Updated May 6\n\nMatt Carpenter (oblique strain): Began a rehab assignment last week with Class AA Springfield and continues it this week with Triple-A Memphis. He has played first base and designated hitter in an attempt to build up at-bats. Placed on the 10-day injured list, backdated to April 2 after feeling discomfort in his torso pregame. Updated May 7\n\nRiley O'Brien (flexor tendon): Placed on the 15-day injured list on March 31 retroactive to March 29, O'Brien's right arm tightened up after his opening day appearance. The initial diagnosis is strain of the flexor tendon; scans showed no structural damage. He began his throwing progression April 23. Updated April 29\n\nKeynan Middleton (forearm strain): On the 15-day IL, Middleton threw a bullpen session last week for the first time since spring training. He's been sidelined by a forearm flexor strain. The planned progression for Middleton includes a pair of bullpen sessions this week followed by him starting a minor-league rehab assignment Friday, likely with Double A Springfield. Updated May 4\n\nDrew Rom (biceps tendinitis): He is likely to have shoulder surgery in the near future after going to Texas for a consultation with a specialist. The lefty had his rehab an injury that took place late in spring training stalled in recent weeks by persisting discomfort and weakness. Rom was added to the 60-day injured list on April 30, suggesting the club expects an extended absence.

We will be covering some of our favorite value players and sleepers that can help you win your league.\n\nMLB best ball is similar to your everyday normal fantasy baseball leagues except you draft your team and don't have to worry about setting lineups. There is no need to stress over free-agent pickups or trying to make a trade with one of your league mates. You just draft your team, kick back, and enjoy the season.\n\nRIVAL Fantasy does take a 10% rake but each draft type is snake and your timer is 45 seconds. There's no reason to have to wait 7 hours and 22 minutes for Billy to finally take his first pitcher. Quick and easy draft to get through, which ultimately means more drafts to do. Check here for the updated rules and scoring.\n\nBobby Witt Jr. is in line for another favorable matchup as Reid Detmers is projected to take the mound for the Los Angeles Angels. Detmers has struggled on the mound, allowing four or more runs in his past three starts. For Witt Jr., he has been having a consistent season, batting .319 (46-for-144) with 10 doubles, five triples, four homers, 19 RBI, 33 runs, 14 walks, 28 strikeouts, and 13 stolen bases. He knows how to pad a stat sheet, which is crucial for daily best ball contests.\n\nLaMonte Wade Jr., 1B - San Francisco Giants\n\nLaMonte Wade Jr. has been seeing the plate well all season long and will get another favorable matchup against the Colorado Rockies and Cal Quantrill. Wade Jr. is hitting .351 (27-for-77) with four doubles, one homer, 10 RBI, 12 runs, 21 walks, and 26 strikeouts through 35 games. Using the RotoBaller tools, he is projected to record nearly 10 fantasy points with a projection of 4.7 plate appearances. The bonus boost for him also is that he is seeing right-handed pitchers well this season, hitting .352 with 25 hits, one homer, seven RBI, and four doubles.\n\nMichael Conforto and the San Francisco Giants have an ideal series for themselves visiting the Colorado Rockies. With a ballpark that favors hitters, Conforto should move up the list when it comes to selecting outfielders. He is batting .252 (33-for-131) with seven doubles, one triple, five homers, 16 runs, 18 RBI, nine walks, and 31 strikeouts in 34 games this season. He'll be facing Cal Quantrill, who is currently 1-3 on the season with 19 ER, 14 walks, 26 strikeouts, and 37 hits in 39 2/3 innings pitched through seven games this season.\n\nLars Nootbaar, RF - St. Louis Cardinals\n\nLars Nootbaar will most likely go under the radar in best ball contests and his overall season has been rough. However, he has found some consistency at the plate with three straight games with a hit now. Nootbaar is hitting .375 (3-for-8) with one double, one homer, two runs, one RBI, and three walks during the span. Now, St. Louis will be starting a new series against the Milwaukee Brewers and Tobias Myers will be on the mound Thursday. The Brewers pitcher has struggled, giving up four runs in back-to-back starts, moving his ERA to 6.23 through three games.\n\nSeattle Mariners starting pitcher Logan Gilbert should be the first pitcher targeted in your drafts. Gilbert has a 1.69 ERA in 48 innings pitched with 50 strikeouts, 13 walks, 25 hits, and nine runs in seven starts. He holds a 3-0 record and faces the Minnesota Twins. The Twins have a batting average of .222 (198-for-892) against right-handed pitchers and have struck out 315 times altogether this season, ranking 14th. The 27-year-old pitcher has been lights out this season, causing opposing teams to struggle at the plate.\n\nSonny Gray, SP - St. Louis Cardinals\n\nSonny Gray is in a similar position to Logan Gilbert as he will face the Milwaukee Brewers. Gray has had an outstanding start to the season with a 0.89 ERA and a 4-1 record through five games. He has yet to allow a team to truly test him as he has only allowed 21 hits with 38 strikeouts and five walks. The Brewers aren't the worst when facing right-handed pitchers as they have a combined batting average of .265. However, Gray has had amazing control on every pitch this season and will cause the Brewers some headaches.\n\nPlay MLB Best Ball Now on RIVAL Fantasy", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_evans@rotoballer.com", "name": "Shaun Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Detmers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reid Detmers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMonte_Wade_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LaMonte Wade Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Conforto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Conforto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2022/05/LaMonte-Wade-Jr.-fantasy-baseball-rankings-draft-sleepers-waiver-wire-pickups-icon-rotoballer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552433", "eventUri": "eng-9552433", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

I know they're all as excited as I am.\"\n\nThe Brewers acquired Gasser, along with outfielder Eury P\u00e9rez and pitcher Dinelson Lamet, when they gave up Hader, who made four of his five career All-Star appearances with Milwaukee.\n\nGasser is the only player from the Hader trade who remains in the Brewers organization. Lamet was designated for assignment before appearing in a game with the Brewers. P\u00e9rez went to Oakland in December 2022 as part of a three-team trade that brought catcher William Contreras to Milwaukee.\n\nGasser's bid to open this season on the major league roster ended when he was diagnosed with bone chips in his throwing elbow. Gasser worked his way back from that and says he feels \"great\" now.\n\n\"They were happy with how I was in spring, what I was bringing to the table,\" Gasser said. \"It was more so just making sure I was sharp when I got back and getting my pitch counts up.\"\n\nAfter working his way back from the injury, Gasser made three starts with Triple-A Nashville and posted an 0-1 record and a 5.25 ERA with 17 strikeouts in 12 innings.\n\n\"We told Gass in spring training, even before the injury, that you're going to pitch in the major leagues, so prepare for your debut,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said.\n\nGasser had gone 9-1 with a 3.79 ERA in 26 games with Nashville last season while striking out 166 in 135 1/3 innings.\n\n\"There's some swing-and-miss in there,\" Murphy said. \"There's a poise. There's a good repertoire that I think matches up with both righties and lefties.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hader", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinelson_Lamet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dinelson Lamet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eury_P\u00e9rez_(outfielder)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eury P\u00e9rez (outfielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Murphy_(baseball_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Murphy (baseball coach)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c7d9ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3854x2168+0+201/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F37%2F07a95b76edb3b583cda2c86a344c%2F61aad315dcf5442da5ac5b88ce8c2c77", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552433", "eventUri": "eng-9552433", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 170}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 452991741, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 13, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 13}}}

(AP) \u2014 The Florida Panthers couldn\u2019t have asked for a better scenario. Sam Reinhart, alone in the slot, on the power play. Game over. Series tied. Reinhart \u2014 the NHL\u2019s power-play goal leader this year \u2014 came through with his 65th and most important goal of the season 1:12 into overtime, and the Panthers topped the New York Rangers 3-2 on Tuesday night, evening the Eastern Conference Final at two games apiece. \u201cIf he\u2019s open, obviously, we want to look for him,\u201d said Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov, who set Reinhart up for the game-winner. With good reason. Reinhart has 31 goals on the man advantage this year, connecting on 32% of his power-play shots. \u201cI saw him wide open there, and I was pretty confident he was putting that one in,\u201d Florida forward Carter Verhaeghe said. \u201cHe has an awesome shot and obviously he made no mistake on that one, and it was awesome.\u201d It was the third straight OT game in the series, and the first one that the Panthers scored in the extra session. And on a night when it took a bounce off a skate and then a baseball swing to give Florida its first two goals of Game 4, the finish was picture-perfect for Florida. Verhaeghe and Sam Bennett also scored for Florida, which got 21 saves \u2014 and an assist \u2014 from Sergei Bobrovsky. Vincent Trocheck and Alexis Lafreni\u00e8re scored for the Rangers, and Igor Shesterkin stopped 37 shots. Game 5 is Thursday in New York, where the teams split the opening two matchups in this series. Game 6 will be Saturday in Sunrise, and the Prince of Wales Trophy \u2014 awarded to the East champs \u2014 will be in attendance that night. \u201cOverall, not the result we wanted,\u201d Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best out of three. We go home and try to take care of Game 5.\u201d Blake Wheeler, playing his first game for the Rangers since mid-February, was called for hooking Barkov 59 seconds into the extra session. And it didn\u2019t take long for the Panthers to cash in, with Barkov setting up Reinhart in front. Rangers defenseman Adam Fox defended Wheeler, who basically had no chance with Barkov skating in alone on Shesterkin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a bad penalty to take. They have a good power play and they capitalized,\u201d Fox said. Bennett got Florida on the board midway through the second period, on a second effort. His first shot got past Shesterkin, but not into the net \u2014 and Bennett, who followed the shot, managed to get to the puck before anyone else. He knocked it off the back of the goalie\u2019s skate and barely across the goal line. And 3 1/2 minutes later, Florida had the lead on a pinball goal by Verhaeghe. Matthew Tkachuk centered the puck from the right corner, and it deflected off Rangers defenseman Ryan Lindgren\u2019s stick. Airborne, it bounced off Shesterkin, then off Lindgren\u2019s upper body \u2014 and Verhaeghe, with more of a baseball swing than anything else, batted it out of the air for a 2-1 Florida edge. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it hit,\u201d Verhaeghe said. Including playoffs, over the last two seasons, Florida entered Tuesday with an NHL-best record of 81-2-6 in games where it led after 40 minutes. Lafreni\u00e8re didn\u2019t care. A neat spin move from Fox got him the puck on the left side of the crease and he tapped it home with 16:32 left for his third goal in the last two games. The rest of regulation was wild. Back and forth, play more often resembling a 3-on-3 regular season overtime than anything else, going end to end \u2014 Bobrovsky making some point-blank stops, Shesterkin once again getting peppered just as he was late in Game 3 to no Florida avail. And for the third straight game, to OT they went. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty desperate team,\u201d Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. \u201cWe have to find an ability to raise to that level.\u201d Trocheck opened the scoring with a power-play tally, on a play where he won a faceoff, moved into the high slot, waited for a centering pass from Artemi Panarin and ripped a perfect shot \u2014 an inch or two past the right side of Bobrovsky\u2019s head, kissing it off the bottom of the crossbar and into the goal. So, the crossbar giveth on that Rangers power play. It taketh away on the next one, when the game of inches went the Panthers\u2019 way. New York had Florida reeling later in the first period, when Brandon Montour was in the box for cross-checking. Zibanejad was alone on the left side of the crease and shot toward a ton of open net, but the puck hit Bobrovsky\u2019s shoulder, ricocheted up to the crossbar \u2014 and this time, bounced back into the crease, just off the goal line as the Panthers remained down only 1-0. \u201cWe have a good feeling,\u201d Bobrovsky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good belief, good trust in each other here. We\u2019ve got great atmosphere. And, yeah, it\u2019s a fun challenge.\u201d Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

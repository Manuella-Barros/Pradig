After Sunrisers skipper Pat Cummins opted to bat first on a red-soil surface, Kolkata struck early with Mitchell Starc and Vaibhav Arora removing their deadly openers. While Starc castled Sharma in the first over, Arora dismissed the deadly Head for a third duck in four innings before KKR seized complete momentum. SRH were reduced to 113 in 18.3 overs - the lowest score in an IPL final - before the Knights romped home in a breezy chase. Led by Venkatesh Iyer's quickfire fifty in 24 balls, KKR trumped Sunrisers for the third time this season.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/kolkata-knight-riders-win-ipl-2024-beat-sunrisers-hyderabad-to-clinch-third-title-9353543/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/des-13.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:55:25", "author": "Sports Desk", "authors": ["Sports Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.25}

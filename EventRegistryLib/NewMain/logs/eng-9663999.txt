His body was found inside his crashed vehicle after he'd worked two consecutive 14-hour overnight shifts.\n\nPriem, a grip for the Fox procedural, died on May 11 of sudden cardiac dysfunction and cardiomegaly with left ventricular hypertrophy, according to records from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office, which released his autopsy results this week. Priem's cause of death was deemed to have been natural, the office said and there was no detection of alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of his death.\n\nThe autopsy results negate the suggestion by his union that his death was a result of drowsiness after overwork on the show's set that led Priem to drift from the highway and die when the vehicle crashed last month. After the news and circumstances of Priem's death broke, his union released statements that suggest unsafe working hours led to the 66-year-old's death.\n\n\"We are fully committed to the safety and the well-being of all our members and express our heartfelt condolences to the member's family,\" IATSE said in a statement. \"Workers have a reasonable expectation that they can get to work and come home safely. No one should be put in unsafe circumstances while trying to earn a living.\"\n\nAn IATSE union leader previously confirmed with The Hollywood Reporter that Priem was a day player on 9-1-1 and his shift on Friday was his second 14-hour production day in a row. He'd left work a little after 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.\n\nAccording to the California Highway Patrol, Priem's Toyota Highlander was found overturned and obstructing the right lanes on the 57 freeway in San Dimas; the crash was reported around 4:27 a.m. on Saturday. According to CHP, Priem's vehicle drifted off the road and up an embankment before flipping onto its roof. Priem was found dead at the scene.\n\nIn a statement following the news of Priem's death, 20th Television said, \"On behalf of the studio and everyone at 9-1-1, we send our sincere and deepest condolences to Rico Priem's family and friends.\"\n\nIATSE is prioritizing imposing financial penalties for long work days and missed rest periods during its ongoing negotiations with studios and streamers after several accidents have been seen on sets this year. In February, J.C. \"Spike\" Osorio died after falling from the rafters at Radford Studios while he was working as a rigger for Marvel's Wonder Man. In April, multiple crew members were injured in an action sequence that did not go as planned on the set of Amazon-MGM Studios' The Pickup.

No one should be put in unsafe circumstances while trying to earn a living,\" it continued.\n\nFollowing the news, Tim Moriarty, Rico Priem's nephew, started a GoFundMe to raise donations for his Uncle's memorial services and wife.\n\n\"On May 11, 2024, Rico tragically lost his life driving home from a 14-hour work day,\" Moriarty wrote in the GoFundMe's description. \"This was his second consecutive 14-hour day for the production company filming the TV show '9-1-1.' After working from Friday at 2 p.m. until 4:10 a.m. Saturday morning, less than 20 minutes from his departure from crew parking, his car was found rolled over on northbound 57 in San Dimas. Rico was pronounced dead on the scene.\"\n\nTim Moriarty described his Uncle as \"an absolute legend in the film & motion picture industry.\"\n\n\"Many have told me he was hands down the best in the business at his job. He always made sure to take care of all of his crew members, as well as connect with everyone that was working around him on set,\" Moriarty wrote. \"He could tell you stories for days, and his connection ran so deep with all of the people's hearts he has touched! It truly was an honor to work with him side by side, and I know everyone else who has worked with him feels the same.\"\n\n\"A heart of gold and a work ethic as strong as a rock, Rico served 30 years in the business with over 75,000 hours under his belt. Filing his paperwork only a few weeks prior, Rico was ready to enjoy his retirement and planning to still work in the business to keep in contact with all of his friends and loved ones in the industry,\" he added.\n\nAfter learning the news, many took to social media to pay tribute to the late \"9-1-1\" crew member. \"No no no. What a loss. Such a sweet man,\" one user, who knew Priem, wrote. \"Way too soon. We worked together for years in 'Major Crimes'.\"\n\nAnother individual said, \"Rico was the best. I worked with him for years and just recently worked with him again. I just can't believe this! He told me all about his retirement plans. I'm just in shock and so sad. Condolences to his family and friends.\"\n\n\"We were just speaking a few months ago about his plans for retirement that he was so looking forward to.. I'm going to miss you, Rico,\" a third said. \"My condolences to his family.\"\n\nOne social media user who also knew Rico Priem left a heartfelt tribute for the late \"9-1-1\" crew member.\n\n\"I worked with Rico for years. He taught me a lot of what the crew goes through and the specifics of individual jobs,\" they wrote. \"Made me understand exactly how we actually make movies. The nuts and bolts. The real stuff. In my early days as a junior producer, he always took care of me. Showed me the way. Protected me. I'm heartbroken.\"\n\n\"Rico was a legend.

Entertainment Weekly has reached out to the LA County Medical Examiner for comment.\n\nPriem, who worked as a grip on the show was a member of union IATSE Local 80, having worked on numerous productions, including S.W.A.T., Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Star Trek, and Christmas With the Kranks.\n\nAt the time of his death, he had worked overnight on a location shoot on 9-1-1 from Friday night into Saturday morning. At the time, it was not known whether or not he might have fallen asleep at the wheel or if the accident was possibly related to the length of his overnight shift.\n\nPriem's death came amid negotiations between the studios and IATSE, with crew safety as it relates to the length of the work day being a hot-button issue in those talks. But long hours increasing the riskiness of the profession are a long-standing point of contention between studios and the union, including as recently as 2021, when one of the main issues in negotiating a new contract at that time was curbing the lengthy hours on set without proper rest or turnaround time. (A regular workday is typically considered to be 12 hours.)\n\nAfter news of Priem's death, his fellow grip and union member Nina Moskol posted a remembrance on social media, calling him, \"an Extraordinary Best Boy Grip.\" \"He was on the cusp of retirement with his paperwork filed,\" she wrote. \"He had his already rich life planned for retirement, including spending time with his wife, watching his grand-nephew grow, riding his beloved Harley, and even gripping still to stay connected to his friends. He was so jazzed about what he had learned about retiring, he wanted to teach the ins and outs of retirement at the local.

It leads to dangerous tachycardia -- or too high of a heart rate -- and ventricular fibrillation, causing a decrease in blood flow -- and therefore oxygen -- to the brain.\n\nHe also suffered from cardiomegaly with left ventricle hypertrophy -- otherwise known as an enlarged heart with thickened walls in the left ventricle.\n\nFollowing Priem's death, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees -- the union to which Priem belonged -- told The Hollywood Reporter that it was \"fully committed to the safety and the well-being of all our members...\" and that \"workers have a reasonable expectation that they can get to work and come home safely.\"\n\n\"No one should be put in unsafe circumstances while trying to earn a living,\" the statement concluded.\n\nA subreddit dedicated to the union, which was in the middle of contract negotiations at the time, also promoted a documentary called Who Needs Sleep, which was inspired by the 1997 death of Brent Hershman, an assistant camera operator who perished in a car crash caused by the fatigue of his excessive work days.\n\nWhile fatigue did not play a part in Priem's death after all, it certainly remains a concern for all those employed on film and television sets.\n\nNext: Remembering the Stars and Legends We've Lost In 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and

The 66-year-old died in May after working a late 14-hour shift on the procedural drama and was pronounced dead on the scene of a highway car accident.\n\nThough the accident was initially thought to be the result of drowsy driving, the autopsy now indicates that a heart attack was to blame.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, Priem died of sudden cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, Priem suffered from cardiomegaly -- or an enlarged heart -- with left ventricle hypertrophy. The manner of his death is classified as natural.\n\nPriem, who also went by Rico, worked as a grip on 9-1-1 and was a member of the IATSE Local 80 crew union.\n\nAccording to a report from TVLine last month, CHP officials said Priem's Toyota Highlander \"left the roadway for unknown reasons, went up an embankment and flipped onto its roof\" at 4:27 a.m. PT on May 11.\n\nAngela Bassett, who stars on the hit Fox show, offered her condolences to Priem's family in an interview with ET shortly after his death.\n\n\"The studio, 9-1-1, we all extend our deepest condolences to his friends to his family,\" Bassett shared. \"It was just a very, very sad moment. We're all rocked by it, certainly.\"\n\n9-1-1 is in its seventh season, and over the years the cast and crew have experienced many milestone moments in each of their personal lives -- from births and weddings to, tragically, now a death in the family.\n\n\"It's the first time [we experience death]. We have births, you know, we have weddings and now to experience this,\" Bassett shared before adding that the cast and crew remembered Priem on the set. \"We just had to take a moment, just take time and take a moment. We thought it was important to come together and have whatever bit of service and offer whatever we can do to his family, 'cause we know that we'll miss him but we know they will miss him even more.\"\n\nBassett added that when the cast and crew got together on the set to remember Priem, \"so many beautiful words were spoken of him.\"\n\nAfter news broke of his death, a representative for 20th Television wrote in a statement to ET, \"On behalf of the studio and everyone at 9-1-1, we send our sincere and deepest condolences to Rico Priem's family and friends.\"\n\nPriem's death was also addressed in a social media post by one of his colleagues, Nina Moskol, who said that they had just worked together a few nights prior.\n\n\"He was on the cusp of retirement, with his paperwork filed,\" the tribute stated. \"He had his already rich life planned for retirement, including spending time with his wife, watching his grand-nephew grow, riding his beloved Harley, and even gripping still to stay connected to his friends. He was so jazzed about what he had learned about retiring, he wanted to teach the ins and outs of retirement at the local.\"\n\n\"We are fully committed to the safety and the well-being of all our members and express our heartfelt condolences to the member's family,\" IATSE said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter in May. \"Workers have a reasonable expectation that they can get to work and come home safely. No one should be put in unsafe circumstances while trying to earn a living.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAngela Bassett Mourns '9-1-1' Crew Member Who Died After 14-Hour Shift\n\n'9-1-1' Crew Member Dies in Car Accident After 14-Hour Shift", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@9news.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Bassett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Bassett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomegaly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiomegaly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Procedural drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventricle (heart)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Highway_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Highway Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heart failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/ETONLINE/images/7ae4bccf-77ce-48ca-ae44-5576dce23931/20240620T203443/7ae4bccf-77ce-48ca-ae44-5576dce23931_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663999", "eventUri": "eng-9663999", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 932, "textEnd": 938}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 456614791, "relevance": 2}

According to India Today, the new couple met at the Ambani family's star-studded cruise party before Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding. Interestingly, Walker is followed by Ananya and her BFFs Shanaya Kapoor and Navya Nanda on Instagram.\n\nA source close to the due told India Today, \"Ananya met Walker on the cruise and soon sparks flew between the duo. The two are currently getting to know each other and have fostered a great friendship. Walker is based out of Jamnagar and works for the Ambanis at the Vantara Animal Park.\"\n\nReports from Bombay Times reveal that Ananya even introduced Walker as her \"partner\" at the glitzy wedding -- sparking fresh romance rumours. \"Ananya introduced everyone to Walker as her partner at the wedding. She was not even hiding it. They were multiple people who even saw them dancing together when a romantic song was being played. It is too new for the two to make it official,\" a source told the publication.\n\nMeanwhile, Ananya Panday seems to be moving on from her alleged breakup with actor Aditya Roy Kapur. From spending time with friends to bringing a new pet home, the actress is taking her own sweet time to relax and pamper herself. The couple, after being together for around two years, parted ways a few months ago. Back in 2022, rumours started making the rounds about Ananya Panday and Aditya Roy Kapur being in a relationship, which gained momentum over time. They were frequently spotted attending common parties and also going on vacations. Not to forget Karan Johar's epic hints on Koffee With Karan.\n\nWhile fans were pretty much convinced about the lovebirds' budding romance, many were left shocked after media reports confirmed their breakup. A close friend of the two actors spoke to the Bombay Times and said, \"They broke up almost a month ago. They were going quite strong, and the break-up came as a shock to all of us. They are cordial with each other. Ananya is trying to move on, of course, there's hurt. She is spending time with her new furry friend. Aditya is also trying to deal with the situation maturely.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananya_Panday", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ananya Panday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditya_Roy_Kapur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aditya Roy Kapur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanda (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koffee_with_Karan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Koffee with Karan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Johar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karan Johar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/fotojet-2024-08-07t161017.785-2024-08-e33c70305f11c8a3dd74c4831bdb862f-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797164", "eventUri": "eng-9797164", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

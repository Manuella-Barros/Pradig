{"id": 225041278, "title": "Couple 'consider calling cops' after \u00a3600 bill for two drinks and pasta on holiday", "text": "A couple were left gobsmacked after being charged more than twice the average monthly wage of their homeland for two drinks and one meal at a Greek restaurant. Oscar Maldonado said the shock bill left him considering calling the police. He and his partner jetted from Honduras to Mykonos for some sun-soaked relaxation last May, but their holiday bliss soon turned sour, The Mirror reports. The couple claim they were enticed into DK Oyster with the promise of complimentary sunbeds on the beach if they each bought a drink. Hoping to snag a bargain compared to the steep prices at other eateries, they settled on two smoothies and also ordered a lobster pasta dish. However, the pair hadn't done their research on the bar, which has received complaints online from a string of disgruntled punters, who allege they were stung with sky-high prices for simple meals and a few drinks after being lured in by friendly waiters. Speaking about their experience Oscar, 35, said: \"They were really really nice and the service was really good, they made conversation with us. We ordered non-alcoholic drinks. Just some smoothies. I didn't ask for the price, then they brought the menu over. It was misleading to say the least. My boyfriend had the lobster pasta.\" Like other unsuspecting patrons before them, the couple didn't realise DK Oyster charge by the gram for the popular crustacean. The doctor continued: \"They served us the largest lobster, it was pasta but with a whole lobster. \"It was a substantial portion. I anticipated it might be expensive, but I never imagined it would be that much.\" After finishing the meal, a small note was discreetly placed on their table, revealing that the price was \u20ac400 (\u00a3340). Oscar said: \"I went to pay, and the guy told me the two smoothies were \u20ac65 each. \"After that he said it was \u20ac600, then he charged \u20ac100 for service charged. I felt tempted to call the police, but I didn't want to cause any trouble. \"I said 'how do you calculate this?' He just went on a rant repeating 'service fee'. I just paid and left. I was p***ed off for the rest of the day and it almost ruined my holiday. I would never go there. I would never recommend it.\" \"I really wasn't expecting it. I live on a Honduran salary, so going to Europe is especially hard. It was a couple's trip. It was really frustrating. I cannot think about Mykonos without transporting back to this moment.\" Last year, following a series of complaints, Tripadvisor issued a 'safety warning' on its page for the restaurant, which said holidaymakers \"may wish to perform additional research for information about this property when making your travel plans.\" Dimitrios Kalamaras, DK Oyster's owner, has previously defended his pricing, accusing those who complain of being attention-seeking. He argued that \"no adult in their right mind\" would order a drink without first checking the price. He said: \"Every time I received such a complaint, always by anonymous users through TripAdvisor, I consulted with the personnel, reminding that it is crucial for our reputation to be sure that procedures are followed carefully \"They always assured me that they abide by the rules. So, I used Tripadvisor to encourage our guests to always browse carefully through the menu and the prices.\" DK Oyster was approached by The Mirror for comment.

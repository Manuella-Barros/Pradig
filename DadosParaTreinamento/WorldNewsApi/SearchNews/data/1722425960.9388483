Jefferson County Circuit Judge Brian Edwards on Friday issued an order tossing out a lawsuit brought by Louisville residents Lisa Sobel, Jessica Kalb and Sarah Baron, who have all experienced challenges to becoming mothers. He said the women lacked standing to bring the case and granted summary judgment to the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s Office, which defended the state\u2019s abortion laws. \u201cWe applaud the Court\u2019s decision to uphold Kentucky law,\u201d Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a news release Friday evening. \u201cMost importantly, the Court eliminates any notion that access to IVF services in our Commonwealth is at risk. Today\u2019s opinion is a welcome reassurance to the many Kentuckians seeking to become parents.\u201d But Aaron Kemper, an attorney for the women, said that is not his reading of the situation. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t offer any protection for IVF whatsoever,\u201d he said in a brief telephone interview. \u201cWe are definitely concerned.\u201d Kemper said his clients \u201care hurt and disappointed\u201d by the ruling, and they plan to appeal. \u201cAfter thirteen months of waiting, we received a nine page decision that we feel fails to comport with the law and makes numerous obvious errors,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cOur nation is waiting for a judiciary brave enough to do what the law and our traditions require. Our clients demand that we continue the fight and we look forward to review by higher courts.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s two abortion bans took effect in the summer of 2022, after the fall of Roe v. Wade, and both are still in place today. A six-week ban, or fetal heartbeat law, prohibits pregnancy termination after a fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks gestation, and a separate trigger law bans abortion except when it\u2019s necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. Sobel, Kalb and Baron sued the state in October 2022, arguing that these \u201cunintelligible\u201d laws give preference to Christian beliefs in such a way that diminishes their rights and religious freedom as people of Jewish faith, who believe life begins at birth, not conception. They also argue the bans are \u201cintentionally vague (so) that ordinary people cannot understand what conduct is prohibited.\u201d Kalb and Sobel have had children by way of in-vitro fertilization, and Kalb currently has nine \u201cfrozen\u201d embryos in storage, in the event she does want to have more children, according to the lawsuit. Baron, who was 37 at the time the lawsuit was filed, has two children and wants a third. But the threat of pregnancy complications \u2014 a pregnancy is considered \u201cgeriatric\u201d and higher risk over the age of 35 \u2014 are compounded by doctors\u2019 limited ability to respond with the standard of care, because of the state\u2019s abortion restrictions. Even if a fetus is nonviable, if the pregnancy poses no risk to a woman, abortion by way of pre-term induction is illegal under Kentucky law. This has led many women with nonviable pregnancies to travel out of state to access what is medically considered routine care that\u2019s recommended by their doctors. As it stands, \u201cKentucky\u2019s current law related to reproduction has discouraged (Baron) from having more children,\u201d the lawsuit reads. What\u2019s more, they argue the bans\u2019 lack of exceptions for cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities violate their religious beliefs. \u201cWhile a fetus is deserving of some level of respect under halakha, the birth giver takes precedence,\u201d their lawsuit reads. \u201cJews have never believed that life begins at conception. This belief belongs to certain Christian groups.\u201d \u201cJewish law stresses the necessity of protecting birth givers in the event a pregnancy endangers the woman\u2019s life and causes the mother physical and mental harm,\u201d their lawsuit reads. \u201cHarm includes but is not limited to rape, incest, or the case of a significant fetal anomaly.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s trigger law threatens health care providers with a Class-D felony if they provide care, either by way of a procedure or medication, \u201cwith the specific intent of causing or abetting the termination of the life of an unborn human being.\u201d The specific reference to \u201cunborn human being\u201d is where the plaintiffs also take issue. They posit a question that has not explicitly been answered by lawmakers by way of clarifying bill language, or the judicial system: Does destruction of frozen embryos that have been extracted for IVF purposes lead to criminal penalties? Edwards wrote in his order filed Friday that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims relating to concerns about being criminally prosecuted for participation in IVF processes are misplaced.\u201d He cited an advisory opinion by former Attorney General Daniel Cameron in which he sought to clarifiy the ban\u2019s scope, saying it \u201cdoes not apply to the use, care, or disposition of embryos fertilized by in vitro fertilization.\u201d But according to Kentucky Revised Statutes, the bans do apply to the disposal of embryos, the plaintiffs argue. KRS define \u201cunborn human being\u201d \u2014 the being current abortion law forbids the termination of \u2014 as an \u201cindividual member of the species homo sapiens throughout the entire embryonic and fetal states of the unborn child, from fertilization to full gestation and childbirth.\u201d \u201cIt is common practice for a couple who has undergone IVF to choose to discard their embryos,\u201d they argue in their suit. \u201cIt is unclear whether under Kentucky law choosing to discard embryos during IFV is a capital offense.\u201d Edwards also cited Kentucky law regarding the prosecution of the death of an unborn child. He said the law does not apply \u201cif those acts were committed as part of ... fertility treatment.\u201d The trio asked for an injunction, that is, for a judge to temporarily block the laws they\u2019re contesting. In order to meet that threshold, they had to show they were or are irreparably and immediately harmed by the current laws and in need of relief. They fell short in this regard, Edwards said. Lindsey Keiser, a lawyer arguing on behalf of Attorney General Coleman\u2019s office, said during oral arguments in late May that none of the three are currently pregnant, and there isn\u2019t a \u201cclear and imminent\u201d threat of prosecution, WFPL reported. \u201cIVF is permissible, and the disposal of embryos treated by IVF but not yet implanted will not trigger criminal penalties,\u201d Keiser said. \u201cThe only statutory restriction on IVF relates to public medical facilities.\u201d", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/kentucky-judge-rules-against-jewish-011108790.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/lexington_herald_leader_mcclatchy_articles_314/a81600d46c014443ed25a79a9a122e19", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:59:28", "author": "Alex Acquisto, Karla Ward", "authors": ["Alex Acquisto, Karla Ward"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.17}

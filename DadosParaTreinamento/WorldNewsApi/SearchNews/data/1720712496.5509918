Nonetheless, the hope of immediate relief drives parents from Assam, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan to seek alternative remedies like the fish prasadam in Hyderabad, and their numbers are growing. \u201cIt's a placebo that helps them morally. As a medical practitioner I cannot advise it,\u201d Dr Mehaboob added. \u201cIn the last few years, especially post-Covid pandemic, we have seen an increase in children accompanied by their parents,\u201d said Nurain Sadik, volunteer at the Bathini fish prasadam distribution centre. \u201cThis year, we administered prasadam to around five lakh people, with every third recipient being a teenager or a child. Administering they prasadam to infants is tricky as most don't swallow the fish; in such cases, we just give them the herbal prasadam,\u201d Sadik said \u201cWe came here from Guwahati. Our neighbour has come here with his daughter and she has started feeling better. We did research on Google and learned more about how the prasadam helps cure asthma,\u201d Ryan, who had come for his eight-year-old son, from Assam. \u201c It's our second visit, and our son felt relief after being given the prasadam last year. We will come next year,\u201d he said. Some children were very uncomfortable with the idea of swallowing the fish live. The event looked well-organised but senior citizens faced difficulties because there were no special queues for them. \u201cThey should have arranged a special queue for people over 50. I have knee problems. It was very difficult to stay in the queue for over six hours. My knees are hurting,\u201d said Bhadu Mahaveer from Nanded, Maharashtra.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/news/fish-prasadam-draws-parents-seeking-asthma-relief-for-kids-898124", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095948-fishprasadam1.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:00:02", "author": "DC Correspondent", "authors": ["DC Correspondent"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.089}

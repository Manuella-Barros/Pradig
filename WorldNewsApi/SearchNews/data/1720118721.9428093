Who is Jack Rhodes? He\u2019s a firm favourite with Britain\u2019s Got Talent fans (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Shutterstock) Jack is one of many magicians to have graced the stage this year, but one of the lucky few to sail through to live shows. Aged 27, Jack hails from Ulverston in Cumbria. In stark contrast to his magician antics, however, Jack worked as a nuclear engineer until January 2024. When his performing took off, though, he quit his day job to be a full-time magician. Speaking during his BGT audition, Jack joked that his parents \u2018weren\u2019t impressed\u2019 at the time, saying: \u2018My dad used to call me a part-time wizard\u2026 sorry, full-time moron. He\u2019s not my biggest fan.\u2019 In 2023, he started sharing his journey on his blog, writing in July that year: \u2018It\u2019s a big day today. I\u2019ve officially started a \u201ccareer break\u201d from my day job as a nuclear engineer. Jack made it through to the final after an epic performance in the semis (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Shutterstock) \u2018I\u2019ve just spent the past 5 months working 12-hour shifts every single day to save enough to afford \u201cgiving it a shot financially\u201d.\u2019 \u2018But what does \u201cgiving it a shot\u201d mean?\u2019, he asked. \u2018Well, for me, at least, it means pursuing a career as a content creator.\u2019 Jack started to share his tricks on social media, later telling OK! Magazine that he had become a \u2018social hermit crab\u2019 as he stayed at home, performing to his camera in the garage. \u2018Britain\u2019s Got Talent is a good way of doing a bit more live stuff which is super exciting as I have got a tour I am doing at the end of October,\u2019 he teased. \u2018I\u2019m hoping BGT is a good way of getting eyes on that and maybe selling some more tickets. \u2018This whole thing is about trying to move from the content world and to get to live audiences and have that amazing reaction from them.\u2019 Throughout Britain\u2019s Got Talent, Jack has amazed viewers and the panel with his skills and comedy. Can he go all the way? (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Shutterstock) Taking to the stage for the first time and admitting that his dream was to perform in Las Vegas, Jack revealed that he had actually been a contestant before. In a previous series, he performed as \u2018the invisible magician\u2019, aka The Phantom, blowing minds with his tricks despite not being seen by anyone. Playing on this, Jack remarked that he is like a \u2018ninja\u2019 and brought back elements of Phantom\u2019s act for his own. After wowing the judges and receiving four yesses, Jack was through to the semi-finals, where he had us all scratching our heads once more with a card trick. The impressive performance promoted intense online speculation and even YouTube videos analysing how it was done. But, what has Jack got up his sleeve for the final? Well, whatever happens, he\u2019s garnered some famous fans already, including 2016 Britain\u2019s Got Talent winner, Richard Jones. Who do you want to win BGT 2024?Comment Now The fellow magic star said on Instagram: \u2018I\u2019ve realised he has a massive following on YouTube and social media because he does really funny edits. \u2018When people go on the show who already have hundreds and thousands of followers and fans, that\u2019s great for someone in BGT.\u2019 Find out if Jack can do enough to pull it out of the bag one more time when the Britain\u2019s Got Talent final airs tonight on ITV1 and ITVX, at 7:30pm.

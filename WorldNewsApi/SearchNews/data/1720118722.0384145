{"id": 227493052, "title": "Trump's attacks on US justice system after guilty verdict could be useful to autocrats like Putin - The Korea Herald", "text": "After his historic guilty verdict in his hush money case, Donald Trump attacked the US criminal justice system, making unfounded claims of a \u201crigged\u201d trial that echoed remarks from the Kremlin. \u201cIf they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,\u201d Trump said Friday, speaking from his namesake tower in New York on Friday. Thousands of miles away, Russian President Vladimir Putin was probably \u201crubbing his hands with glee,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior White House national security adviser to three US presidents, including Trump. Hill and other analysts say Trump\u2019s attacks could be useful to Putin and other autocrats as they look to boost their standing among their own citizens, potentially sway the upcoming US presidential election in which Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, and undermine the United States\u2019 global influence. Some autocratic countries reacted swiftly in support of Trump. Moscow agreed with Trump's assessment of Thursday's verdict, calling it the \u201celimination of political rivals by all possible legal or illegal means,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In September, Putin said the prosecution of Trump was political revenge that \u201cshows the rottenness of the American political system.\u201d After the verdict, Hungary's populist, pro-Russia prime minister, Viktor Orban, called Trump a \u201cman of honor\u201d and urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting.\u201d China\u2019s state-owned Global Times newspaper suggested Trump\u2019s conviction adds to the \u201cfarcical nature\u201d of this year's US presidential election, adding that it will aggravate political extremism and end in \u201cmore chaos and social unrest.\u201d Putin is especially likely to see the latest turmoil as an opportunity, analysts say. He has long sought to widen divisions in Western societies in an attempt to advance a Russian worldview. Since the invasion of Ukraine, and ahead of crucial elections throughout the West this year, Russia has been accused of carrying out multiple attacks of sabotage and of targeting dissidents abroad to stoke anxieties and sow discord. Moscow was accused of meddling in the 2016 US election that Trump won by creating a troll factory, hacking Hillary Clinton's campaign , spreading fake news and trying to influence Trump-linked officials. \u201cWhat mischief does he have to make when you have people within the American system itself denigrating it and pulling it down?\u201d Hill said of Putin. Political chaos can benefit autocratic leaders by distracting Washington from key issues, including the war in Ukraine. Russia's goal is to move voices from the \"fringes of the political debate to the mainstream,\u201d said David Salvo, Managing Director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, D.C. The Kremlin does that partly by pushing Russian points of view under the guise of news and social media posts that look like they originate in the West. Salvo noted that disagreements in Congress that delayed an aid package to Ukraine followed a Russian social media campaign aimed at Americans. That led to Russia gaining the upper hand on the battlefield. The attacks on the US justice system from Trump and his allies are \u201cperfect fodder\" for another \"major propaganda and influence operation,\u201d Hill told The Associated Press, suggesting Russia could target swing voters in battleground states ahead of the November election. For generations, US presidential administrations have depicted America as a bastion of democracy, free speech and human rights and have encouraged other states to adopt those ideals. But Trump suggested the justice system is being used to persecute him \u2014 something that happens in some autocratic countries. Leaders including Putin \u201cmust love\u201d that Trump is criticizing \u201cthe key institutions of democracy\u201d in the way autocratic states have done for years as it legitimizes them in the eyes of their own people said Graeme Robertson, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Trump sees himself as a \u201cstrongman ruler\u201d and looks to Putin for inspiration, Hill said. His attacks encourage any nation \u2014 from those with a mild gripe to the openly hostile \u2014 to \u201chave their moment to bring down the colossus,\u201d Hill said. The message to Chinese and Russian citizens watching the drama unfold in the US is that they are better off at home. The message to countries that Russia and China are courting as they attempt to expand their influence in Africa, Asia and Latin America is that Moscow and Beijing can offer more reliable partnerships. The threat from the \u201cnew axis of authoritarians,\u201d including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea is \u201cdaunting,\u201d as those states work more closely together with overlapping interests said Matthew Kroenig, a former defense official and vice president at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. Moscow in particular, Kroenig said, will likely try to use the political turmoil in the US to divide the NATO security alliance. It could try to turn the public in NATO states against the US by encouraging them to question whether they have \u201cshared values\u201d with Americans, he said. If successful, that could lead to a fundamental reshaping of global security architecture \u2014 a goal of Russia and China \u2014 since the end of the Cold War. Some Western governments, meanwhile, are caught in a delicate dance between not wanting to ostracize Trump as a potential next US president and the need to respect the US justice system. Others, such as EU member Hungary, openly court him. \u201cFor Putin it must be perfect because it creates a mess that he can try to seek advantage from,\u201d Hill said.", "summary": "After his historic guilty verdict in his hush money case, Donald Trump attacked the US criminal justice system, making unfounded claims of a &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; trial that echoed remarks from the Kremlin. &ldquo;If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,&rdquo; Trump said Friday, speaking from his namesake tower in New York on Friday.

In an announcement, the school described the Louisiana native, who is from Baker and graduate of Louisiana State University, as a \"trailblazing Black woman\" who forged her own path.\n\nBut soon after news of her appearance at the historically Black university spread, students asked the administration to cancel her speech and created an online petition calling for the same.

She also serves as the U.S. representative on the U.N.'s Security Council.\n\nShe has spent more than three decades working as a public servant for the U.S. Foreign Service, where she served as the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia and held multiple postings in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, Gambia, Nigeria, and Jamaica.\n\nThomas-Greenfield was recently invited, and then disinvited, from another university amid similar backlash. She was set to deliver the commencement address at the University of Vermont. But officials canceled her speech at the request of pro-Palestinian student protesters, who also cited the vetoed ceasefire resolutions, according to the Burlington Free Press.\n\nXavier Muslim Student Association President Zaynab Al-Rashed, who will graduate on Saturday, created the Change.org petition calling on university administrators to find a new commencement speaker and support calls for a ceasefire. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 1,600 people had signed it.\n\nAl-Rashed said she met with administrators Monday and was told that the university began the search for a commencement speaker in September before war broke out in Gaza. She said she was told that the decision to keep or cancel the speech lies with Xavier President Reynold Verret, who was out of the country on university business.\n\n\"We would definitely hope that the U.N. ambassador herself or the administration reconsider the choice of her speaking at our commencement,\" said Al-Rashed, a senior majoring in biology who plans to attend medical school. \"We

In an announcement, the school described the Louisiana native, who is from Baker and graduate of Louisiana State University, as a \"trailblazing Black woman\" who forged her own path.\n\nBut soon after news of her appearance at the historically Black university spread, students asked the administration to cancel her speech and created an online petition calling for the same. They have also asked university officials to review how commencement speakers are chosen in the future.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that the university has chosen to invite a U.N. ambassador who has voted against a ceasefire in Gaza to address our graduating class,\" wrote Chase Patterson, Xavier's student government association president. \"This decision sparked significant dismay and disappointment among us, as it contradicts the values and principles that our institution upholds. ... As members of a compassionate and empathetic community, we cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of our fellow human beings.\"\n\nBefore presenting a March resolution to the U.N.'s Security Council that called for an \"immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza,\" the U.S. vetoed three other ceasefire resolutions proposed by other countries. In explaining one veto, Thomas Greenfield said that the U.S. could not support ceasefire resolutions that do not mention Israel's right to self-defense; in explaining another, she said the U.S. could not support a ceasefire until Hamas freed hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nSince October, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians have been killed in Gaza.\n\nXavier administrators did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would rescind Thomas-Greenfield's invitation.\n\nThomas-Greenfield, who has not commented on the Xavier invitation, has served as U.N. ambassador under President Joe Biden since her confirmation in 2021. She also serves as the U.S. representative on the U.N.'s Security Council.\n\nShe has spent more than three decades working as a public servant for the U.S. Foreign Service, where she served as the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia and held multiple postings in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, Gambia, Nigeria, and Jamaica.\n\nThomas-Greenfield was recently invited, and then disinvited, from another university amid similar backlash. She was set to deliver the commencement address at the University of Vermont. But officials canceled her speech at the request of pro-Palestinian student protesters, who also cited the vetoed ceasefire resolutions, according to the Burlington Free Press.\n\nXavier Muslim Student Association President Zaynab Al-Rashed, who will graduate on Saturday, created the Change.org petition calling on university administrators to find a new commencement speaker and support calls for a ceasefire. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 1,600 people had signed it.\n\nAl-Rashed said she met with administrators Monday and was told that the university began the search for a commencement speaker in September before war broke out in Gaza. She said she was told that the decision to keep or cancel the speech lies with Xavier President Reynold Verret, who was out of the country on university business.\n\n\"We would definitely hope that the U.N. ambassador herself or the administration reconsider the choice of her speaking at our commencement,\" said Al-Rashed, a senior majoring in biology who plans to attend medical school. \"We really want this to be a celebratory conclusion to our time at Xavier, and there is concern that having this individual speak takes away from that.\"", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType":

They have also asked university officials to review how commencement speakers are chosen in the future.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that the university has chosen to invite a U.N. ambassador who has voted against a ceasefire in Gaza to address our graduating class,\" wrote Chase Patterson, Xavier's student government association president. \"This decision sparked significant dismay and disappointment among us, as it contradicts the values and principles that our institution upholds. ... As members of a compassionate and empathetic community, we cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of our fellow human beings.\"\n\nBefore presenting a March resolution to the U.N.'s Security Council that called for an \"immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza,\" the U.S. vetoed three other ceasefire resolutions proposed by other countries. In explaining one veto, Thomas Greenfield said that the U.S. could not support ceasefire resolutions that do not mention Israel's right to self-defense; in explaining another, she said the U.S. could not support a ceasefire until Hamas freed hostages it took during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nSince October, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians have been killed in Gaza.\n\nXavier administrators did not respond to questions about whether they would rescind Thomas-Greenfield's invitation. Neither did Thomas-Greenfield immediately provide a comment.\n\nThomas-Greenfield has served as U.N. ambassador under President Joe Biden since her confirmation in 2021. She also serves as the U.S. representative on U.N.'s Security Council.\n\nShe has spent more than three decades working as a public servant for the U.S. Foreign Service where she served as the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia and held multiple postings in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, Gambia, Nigeria, and Jamaica.\n\nThomas-Greenfield was recently invited, and then disinvited, from another university amid backlash. She was set to deliver the commencement address at University of Vermont but officials canceled her speech at the request of pro-Palestinian student protesters, who also cited the vetoed ceasefire resolutions, according to the Burlington Free Press.\n\nThough Xavier's students have not staged the sorts of anti-war protests that have forced class cancellations at other universities nationwide, students and alumni decried Thomas-Greenfield's invitation this week.\n\nXavier Muslim Student Association President Zaynab Al-Rashed, who will graduate on Saturday, created the Change.org petition calling on university administrators to find a new commencement speaker and support calls for a ceasefire. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 1,600 people had signed it.\n\nAl-Rashed said she met with administrators Monday and was told that the university began the search for a commencement speaker in September before war broke out in Gaza. Though the university announced that Thomas-Greenfield would speak only days ago, it's likely that it was finalized weeks prior, Al-Rashed said.\n\nShe said she was told that the decision to keep or cancel the speech lies with Xavier President Reynold Verret, who could not meet with students on Monday because he was out of the country on university business. He is expected to return Wednesday, Al-Rashed said.\n\n\"We would definitely hope that the U.N. ambassador herself or the administration reconsider the choice of her speaking at our commencement,\" said Al-Rashed, a senior majoring in biology who plans to attend medical school. \"We really want this to be a celebratory conclusion to our time at Xavier, and there is concern that having this individual speak takes away from that.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, Thomas-Greenfield was still set to speak on Saturday in a 1 p.m. ceremony at the Xavier Convocation Center on Stroelitz Street in Gert Town.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The move came days after the University of Vermont also canceled Thomas-Greenfield's commencement address.\n\nAdministrators at both universities cited pressure from students and the community over the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war with Hamas.\n\n\"The vast majority of students want to be able to enjoy a commencement ceremony free of disruptions,\" wrote Xavier President Dr. Reynold Verret in a letter. He called the university's decision to disinvite Thomas-Greenfield \"regrettable\" and said that it had decided to do so \"together with Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's team.\"\n\nXavier announced Thomas-Greenfield as commencement speaker on May 5. But three days later, after more than 1,700 people signed a petition calling on the university to pull the invitation, the New Orleans-based university reversed course.\n\nThe student-led petition asked the university to \"end the politicization of our Commencement ceremony\" and cited Thomas-Greenfield's record at the U.N. She has previously voted against measures calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nNate Evans, a spokesperson for Thomas-Greenfield, told CBS News, \"Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield looks forward to continuing to engage with young people on campuses and other fora across the country to inspire the next generation of diplomats, as she has recently done in Pennsylvania, Texas, and New York.\"\n\nThe ambassador recently toured a high school in Philadelphia, where she held a school-wide assembly and met privately with a group of Palestinian students.\n\nLast week, Thomas-Greenfield was disinvited to speak at the University of Vermont's commencement ceremony.\n\nIn a letter to the university community, University of Vermont President Suresh Garimella acknowledged demonstrations on campus. \"I hear your frustration with foreign policy decisions,\" he wrote, adding that the decision to cancel the ambassador's appearance was made \"with regret.\"\n\nCBS News has learned the university formally invited Thomas-Greenfield to speak at its commencement last summer, several months before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The invitation from Xavier came early this year, long before campus protests broke out nationwide.\n\nA source familiar with the ambassador's thinking told CBS News that Thomas-Greenfield is not deterred by the demonstrations at either school and was prepared to deliver her remarks. The source said she is also mindful of the threat of protesters disrupting commencement ceremonies which could take away from honoring graduates and their achievements.\n\nThomas-Greenfield has served in a variety of diplomatic roles over a nearly 40-year career in government. She was named U.N. ambassador at the start of the Biden administration.\n\nOn Thursday, speaking to Dallas station WFAA, she offered a message to protesters on college campuses across the country. \"I want the students to know that they are being heard. At the same time, we have to be clear that they can't use violence as a means of getting their message across,\" Thomas-Greenfield said. She was not asked about the commencement ceremonies specifically.\n\nPresident Biden is scheduled to address graduates at Morehouse College on May 19. So far, student protests there have not altered commencement plans at the historically Black college in Atlanta.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors":

But college campuses nationwide have seen increased demonstrations in recent weeks linked to Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza that followed a terror attack and kidnappings carried out by Hamas last Oct. 7.\n\n\"In recent days, we have heard the voices of a number of students and others in the Xavier community, who have expressed reservations over the invitation to Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield to serve as our 2024 commencement speaker and have shared their strong views on the United States' position on the conflict in the Middle East,\" Verret wrote. \"There are also many in this community who admire Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield and believe she would meaningfully contribute to the commencement ceremony.\n\n\"That said, everyone's goal is to have a commencement ceremony that appropriately honors the graduates and their achievements. The vast majority of students want to be able to enjoy a commencement ceremony free of disruptions. Therefore, we will not be moving forward with the commencement speaker as originally planned.\"\n\nThe university only announced Thomas-Greenfield as its commencement speaker on May 5, before pulling the invitation three days later.\n\nVerret added that the university \"came to this regrettable conclusion together with Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's team,\" and that it looked forward to welcoming the diplomat to the New Orleans campus at a future date \"to engage with our students and faculty in substantive conversations.\"", "source": {"uri": "wafb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University_of_Louisiana", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University of Louisiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Thomas-Greenfield", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linda Thomas-Greenfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynold_Verret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reynold Verret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambassadors_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambassadors of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://gray-wafb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/S4AN2EE4HBHF3PPYJIDUT7J5CY.jpg?auth=b1f7fe63f230a26db84bdf29e2edf6364705c862876e9d8fc9b5d8bb459c43a1&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551058", "eventUri": "eng-9551058", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 66, "textEnd": 71}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 307}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 751, "textEnd": 757}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1669, "textEnd": 1674}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

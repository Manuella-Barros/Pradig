Calhoun announced in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing named its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and revenue lower than Wall Street expected, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company after the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet raised manufacturing quality concerns.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\" Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said.

He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg will inherit the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company. Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflect the continuing challenges at Boeing. The company reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA has limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners since shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year-end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine that it would pay as part of an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the deal, which is opposed by many families of those who died in the two Max crashes.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.

Calhoun said in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing announced its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and the company's revenue was lower than Wall Street's dismal expectations, as both Boeing's commercial airplanes business and defence unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing, which is the subject of multiple investigations into its safety culture and manufacturing quality.\n\nThe American aerospace giant agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company and limited the number of planes it could produce after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Max flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet. No one was seriously hurt, but the frightening incident and subsequent scrutiny have damaged Boeing's reputation.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\" Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nOrtberg emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018 when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg inherits the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflected the continuing challenges at Boeing. The reported loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier. Since the start of 2019, Boeing has lost more than $25 billion.\n\nExcluding special items, the second-quarter loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion. The commercial airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million, and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year-end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine it agreed to pay as part of its plea deal with the Justice Department in connection with the development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the agreement, which also calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor and for Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nMany families of the people who died in the two Max crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia less than five months later, oppose the deal and plan to ask the judge to reject it.\n\nBoeing's defence and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets. The smaller services business earned $870 million.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2% in morning trading.\n\nDavid Koenig, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "pipestoneflyer.ca", "dataType": "news",

Calhoun announced in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing named its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and revenue lower than Wall Street expected, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company after the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet raised manufacturing quality concerns.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\" Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nOrtberg emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018, when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg will inherit the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company. Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflect the continuing challenges at Boeing. The company reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA has limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners since shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine that it would pay as part of an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the deal, which is opposed by many families of those who died in the two Max crashes.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets.

Ortberg earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nBut Ortberg's appointment doesn't necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company's new leadership. While Calhoun's background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, who was CEO at Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.\n\nOrtberg started work in the aviation industry in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager. He became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, and retired from the company in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRockwell Collins provides avionics, the electrical systems used on aircraft, and information technology used in the aerospace industry. It was purchased by United Technologies in 2018 and now operates as Collins Aerospace. Ortberg stayed with the company for three years as it was integrated into United Technologies, and then he retired.\n\nEven one of Boeing's harshest critics found hope in the appointment of Ortberg.\n\n\"The arrival of a new CEO at Boeing could not have happened at a more crucial and necessary time for the safety of the traveling public around the world,\" said Robert Clifford, attorney for the families of 737 Max crash victims. He said that under Muilenberg, Calhoun, and Boeing's \"do nothing\" board, the company has been in a \"nosedive.\"\n\nSerious problems to solve\n\nOrtberg will have his hands full fixing the problems at Boeing, which has not posted a profitable year since 2019. Since then, its core operating losses totaled $33.3 billion, including the loss announced Wednesday. That loss was far larger than forecast by analysts. Boeing will have difficulty returning to profitability until it can convince regulators that it has fixed problems with the safety and quality of its jets.\n\nThe company has admitted that two 737 Max crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 that killed a total of 346 people were the result of a design flaw. The crashes and the time it took to fix the design cost the company more than $20 billion.\n\nIt recently agreed to plead guilty to charges that its employees defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max. As part of the guilty plea, Boeing agreed to operate under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe company has come under renewed scrutiny after a 737 Max plane's door plug blew off shortly after takeoff in January. More than a dozen whistleblowers have told Congressional investigators about bad practices at Boeing, including the use of parts that did not meet standards. Many said Boeing retaliated against employees who complained about safety practices.\n\nThe company has agreed to an FAA demand to curb production of the 737 Max until the regulator is satisfied it has fixed its safety and quality issues. But that will keep the losses building at Boeing as it can't make money at its current level of production.\n\nBoeing's problems go beyond the 737 Max issues. The company also has problems with its defense business, which resulted in $913 million in losses on its defense, space and security unit, nearly double the $527 million it lost there a year earlier.\n\nIts Starliner space ship made its first crewed flight in the quarter but developed problems after docking at the International Space Station, leaving its two astronauts stuck at the ISS with no date yet known for their return.\n\nBoeing also reported it had additional losses in its program to deliver two new 747 jets that will be used as the new Air Force One planes by the president. That contract has already cost Boeing more than $2 billion going into the quarter. It said Wednesday that increased engineering costs for that contract and for the Starliner contributed to Boeing's increased losses.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) initially fell in premarket trading on the financial results, then bounced back on news moments later that Ortberg had been tapped as CEO. Shares were up more than 1% at the US market open. But shares are down 28% year to date through Tuesday's market close.\n\nThis story was updated with additional reporting and context.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The company aims to pivot from aggressive fixed-price contracts and manage its quality crisis to restore stability.Boeing has announced the appointment of Kelly Ortberg as its new President and CEO, effective August 8, 2024. Ortberg, a seasoned aerospace executive, will succeed Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020 and announced his retirement earlier this year. \"The Board conducted a thorough and extensive search process over the last several months to select the next CEO of Boeing, and Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter,\" said Steven Mollenkopf, Chair of Boeing's Board of Directors. Ortberg will also join Boeing's Board of Directors.\n\nThe leadership change comes at a crucial time for Boeing, which recently reported a $1.4 billion quarterly loss. The company's Defense, Space, and Security unit has significantly contributed to these losses due to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts. These contracts, which have high margins, have made Boeing vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have impacted U.S. corporate earnings in recent years. In 2023 and 2022 alone, the unit's losses amounted to billions of dollars.\n\nReuters reported that Boeing's commercial aircraft production has also faced considerable setbacks. In January, a cabin panel on a 737 MAX 9 jet blew off midair, leading to a production slowdown and intense regulatory scrutiny. The U.S. aviation regulator has capped the production of 737 MAX jets at 38 per month, but actual production has sometimes been lower. This has led to reduced deliveries and frustrated customers, with Boeing delivering 92 aircraft in the second quarter of this year, down 32% from the previous year.\n\nTo address these challenges, Boeing has announced a strategic pivot away from aggressive bidding on fixed-price contracts, which have proven financially risky. \"Ahead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was 'significantly challenged' during the quarter,\" highlighting the need for a strategic shift. Boeing CFO Brian West stated in May that the company will \"burn rather than generate cash in 2024,\" due to lower jet deliveries compared to the previous year.\n\nOrtberg's Vision\n\nOrtberg, who brings over 35 years of aerospace experience, expressed his commitment to leading Boeing through these turbulent times. \"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" Ortberg said. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront. There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nOrtberg's extensive background includes key leadership roles at Rockwell Collins and its integration with United Technologies and RTX. He has served on various boards, including the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and Aptiv PLC. His experience in managing complex engineering and manufacturing operations will be instrumental in Boeing's turnaround efforts.\n\nBoeing, a leading global aerospace company, develops, manufactures, and services commercial airplanes, defense products, and space systems for customers in over 150 countries. As a top U.S. exporter, Boeing leverages the talents of a global supplier base to advance economic opportunity, sustainability, and community impact.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptiv", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aptiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_Industries_Association", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace Industries Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_limited_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public limited company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112169686,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-47592,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 701, "textEnd": 713}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg in a statement from the company. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\"\n\nOrtberg, who noted \"there is much work to be done\" at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing's management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.\n\nBut Ortberg's appointment doesn't necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company's new leadership. While Calhoun's background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.\n\nOrtberg started work in the aviation industry in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager. He became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, and retired from the company in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRockwell Collins provides avionics, the electrical systems used on aircraft, and information technology used in the aerospace industry. It was purchased by United Technologies in 2018 and now operates as Collins Aerospace. Ortberg stayed with the company for three years as it was integrated into United Technologies, and then he retired.\n\nOrtberg will have his hands full fixing the problems at Boeing, which has not posted a profitable year since 2019. Since then, its core operating losses totaled $33.3 billion, including the loss announced Wednesday. Boeing will have difficulty returning to profitability until it can convince regulators that it has fixed problems with the safety and quality of its jets.\n\nThe company has admitted that two 737 Max crashes in October of 2018 and March of 2019 that killed a total of 346 people were the result of a design flaw. The crashes and the time it took to fix the design flaw resulted in a 20-month grounding of the plane that cost the company more than $20 billion.\n\nIt recently agreed to plead guilty to charges that its employees defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process for the 737 Max. As part of the guilty plea, Boeing agreed to operate under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe company has come under renewed scrutiny since a 737 Max plane's door plug blew off shortly after takeoff in January. More than a dozen whistleblowers have told Congressional investigators about bad practices at Boeing, including the use of parts that did not mean standards. Many said Boeing retaliated against employees who complained about safety practices.\n\nThe company has agreed to an FAA demand to curb production of the 737 Max until the regulator is satisfied it has fixed its safety and quality issues. But that will keep the losses building at Boeing as it can't make money at its current level of production.\n\nBoeing's problems go beyond the 737 Max issues. The company also has problems with its defense business, which resulted in $913 million in losses on its defense, space and security unit, nearly double the $527 million it lost there a year earlier.\n\nIts Starliner space ship made its first crewed flight in the quarter but developed problems after docking at the International Space Station, leaving its two astronauts stuck at the ISS with no date yet known for its return.\n\nBoeing also reported it had additional losses in its program to deliver two new 747 jets that will be used as the new Air Force One planes by the president. That contract has already cost Boeing more than $2 billion going into the quarter. It said Wednesday that increased engineering costs for that contract and for the Starliner contributed to Boeing's increased losses.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018, when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg will inherit the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company. Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflect the continuing challenges at Boeing. The company reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA has limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners since shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine that it would pay as part of an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the deal, which is opposed by many families of those who died in the two Max crashes.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets. The smaller services business earned $870 million.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2% in morning trading.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg in a statement from the company. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\"\n\nOrtberg, who noted \"there is much work to be done\" at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing's management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.\n\nBut Ortberg's appointment doesn't necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company's new leadership. While Calhoun's background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.\n\nOrtberg started work in the aviation industry in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager. He became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, and retired from the company in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRockwell Collins provides avionics, the electrical systems used on aircraft, and information technology used in the aerospace industry. It was purchased by United Technologies in 2018 and now operates as Collins Aerospace. Ortberg stayed with the company for three years as it was integrated into United Technologies, and then he retired.\n\nHe will have his hands full fixing the problems at Boeing, which has not posted a profitable year since 2019. Since then, its core operating losses totaled $33.3 billion, including the loss announced Wednesday. Boeing will have difficulty returning to profitability until it can convince regulators that it has fixed problems with the safety and quality of its jets.\n\n- This is a developing story, it will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\n\"The Board would also like to thank Dave Calhoun for his strong leadership at Boeing, first as Chair and then as CEO, when he stepped in to steer the company through the challenges of recent years,\" added Mollenkopf.\n\n\"I'm extremely honoured and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront. There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nOrtberg, 64, brings over 35 years of aerospace leadership to this position, added the aircraft manufacturer's official statement.\n\nFinancial results\n\nThe company also posted a bigger quarterly loss, as its troubled defence and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the US planemaker that has already scaled back commercial aircraft production to tackle a quality crisis.\n\nBoeing's Defence, Space and Security unit, one of its three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defence contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented US corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76bn last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said, in May, the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.\n\nBoeing's ongoing crisis\n\nThe company is mired in crisis after a cabin panel on a 737 MAX 9 jets blew off midair in January, which led to a slowdown in production of its top-selling plane and a management shakeup, even as it came under intense regulatory and legal scrutiny.\n\nThe US aviation regulator has capped production of 737 MAX jets at 38 per month, though Reuters has reported that Boeing has been producing jets during some weeks at a much lower level.\n\nThat has led to lower deliveries, frustrating customers.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Boeing delivered a total of 92 aircraft, down 32 per cent from last year.\n\nRead:

Jennifer Buchanan/The Seattle Times via AP hide caption\n\nAfter a lengthy search, Boeing has tapped aerospace industry veteran Robert \"Kelly\" Ortberg as its next CEO, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nOrtberg will start the job on Aug. 8, replacing retiring CEO Dave Calhoun, who has been under fire as the company's commercial airplane and defense programs continue to struggle.\n\nBoeing will now turn to Ortberg to lead its turnaround plans. He has a background in engineering, not finance, having earned a mechanical engineering degree at the University of Iowa. That may help assuage the concerns of critics who say Boeing's leadership has been too focused on financial results and not enough on engineering quality.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" Ortberg said in a statement. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront. There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nThe job facing Ortberg is daunting. Boeing reported a bigger quarterly loss and weaker revenue than analysts were expecting during the second quarter. The aerospace giant reported a net loss of $1.44 billion in the second quarter, as increased scrutiny of its production lines has limited production of its bestselling 737 Max jets.\n\n\"Despite a challenging quarter, we are making substantial progress strengthening our quality management system and positioning our company for the future,\" Calhoun said. \"While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations and ensure Boeing is the company the world needs it to be.\"\n\nBoeing's board Chair Steve Mollenkopf announced the new CEO in a message to employees.\n\n\"The Board conducted a thorough and extensive search process over the last several months to select the next CEO of Boeing and Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter,\" Mollenkopf wrote. \"He is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\"\n\nOrtberg, 64, is just a few years younger than the company's outgoing leader. Boeing's board had previously extended its mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70 to allow Calhoun, now 67, to stay on as CEO.\n\nOrtberg's career in the aviation industry started at Texas Instruments. He joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 and rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2013. He oversaw mergers with United Technology and RTX (formerly Raytheon) before retiring from the company in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_rose@npr.org", "name": "Joel Rose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seattle_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Seattle Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iowa", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Iowa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_Technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raytheon Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Instruments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Start_Up", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Start Up", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5825x3277+0+9/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff0%2Fa3%2Fb36d5076497faa226de00b341a69%2Fboeing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 323, "textEnd": 329}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The loss was wider and revenue lower than Wall Street expected, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet. It is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety.\n\nThe company is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nOrtberg will become CEO and president on Aug. 8, Boeing said. He emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial-airplanes division.\n\nChairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\n\nMollenkopf said Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said the company had waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share.

Calhoun announced in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing named its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and revenue lower than Wall Street expected, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The company agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company after the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet raised manufacturing quality concerns.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\" Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nOrtberg emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018, when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg will inherit the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company. Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflect the continuing challenges at Boeing. The company reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA has limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners since shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process.

The smaller services business earned $870 million.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2% in morning trading.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg in a statement from the company. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\"\n\nOrtberg, who noted \"there is much work to be done\" at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing's management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.\n\nBut Ortberg's appointment doesn't necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company's new leadership. While Calhoun's background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.\n\nOrtberg started work in the aviation industry in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager. He became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, and retired from the company in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Calhoun said in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing announced its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and the company's revenue lower than Wall Street's dismal expectations, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor?

Cardinals broadcaster Bally secures Comcast deal, clearing major hurdle in bankruptcy plan At the buzzer, Cardinals send Dylan Carlson to Tampa Bay for reliever Shawn Armstrong\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing, which is the subject of multiple investigations into its safety culture and manufacturing quality.\n\nThe American aerospace giant agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company and limited the number of planes it could produce after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Max flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet. No one was seriously hurt, but the frightening incident and subsequent scrutiny have damaged Boeing's reputation.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\" Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nOrtberg emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018, when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg inherits the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflected the continuing challenges at Boeing. The reported loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier. Since the start of 2019, Boeing has lost more than $25 billion.\n\nExcluding special items, the second-quarter loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion. The commercial airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million, and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine it agreed to pay as part of its plea deal with the Justice Department in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the agreement, which also calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor and for Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\n\nMany families of the people who died in the two Max crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia less than five months later, oppose the deal and plan to ask the judge to reject it.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets. The smaller services business earned $870 million.\n\nBoeing shares rose 2% in morning trading.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. Summary Ortberg to become Boeing's President and CEO on August 8th, 2024. Ortberg brings experience from Collins Aerospace and Rockwell Collins. Calhoun stepping down amid incidents, Ortberg appointed from outside Boeing.\n\nBoeing has selected Kelly Ortberg as its new President and CEO after Dave Calhoun announced he would step down in 2024. The selection was first hinted at by The Air Current yesterday and confirmed by Boeing just now. Calhoun has been President and CEO since January 2020.\n\nOrtberg was previously the CEO of Collins Aerospace and Rockwell Collins, as well as an advisor to the CEO of RTX. According to the latter, he currently co-heads an organization hosting annual school robotics competitions. Ortberg will begin the top job at Boeing on August 8th, 2024. This announcment comes at the same time as Boeing's Q2 results after a flurry of orders at the recent Farnborough International Airshow 2024 .\n\nPhoto: Thiago B Trevisan | Shutterstock Boeing's new management\n\nDave Calhoun announced his intention to step down as the CEO and President of Boeing in March 2024. The news came following a slew of incidents, most notably an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX losing a door mid-flight. There has been much speculation as to who would take the top job since Calhoun announced his resignation, and now we have an answer.\n\nKelly Ortberg is set to take the top job in just over a week, begining as the CEO and President on August 8th. Commenting on his appointment, Ortberg remarked,\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company. Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront. There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nPhoto: RTX Who is Kelly Ortberg?\n\nIt was first hinted that Ortberg was in the running for the top job just yesterday, but who is the man taking one of the top jobs in aviation?

He will start Aug. 8.\n\nOrtberg, 64, previously led major aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, which later became Collins Aerospace, leading major acquisitions, including one early in his tenure. The business is now part of industry behemoth RTX. He retired in 2021, though he was most recently on RTX's board and resigned on Wednesday.\n\nThe appointment of the more-than-three-decade aerospace veteran shows Boeing is seeking a steady hand that knows the industry -- but also a company outsider. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a July 29 note that at Collins, Ortberg was a \"tough negotiator dealing with a diverse set of customers and suppliers and managing the complexity of its diverse customer base,\" including Boeing.\n\nOrtberg, who has a mechanical engineering degree, will face a host of challenges to turn Boeing around: persistent losses, additional regulator scrutiny, supply chain strains, a crisis of confidence from airline customers whose planes are delayed, and tense labor talks that now include the threat of a strike.\n\nBoeing said in March that Calhoun would step down by year's end, part of a broader company shake-up that also included the departure of its then-chairman and the replacement of its head of commercial aircraft unit. The changes came after a door plug blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9, heightening federal scrutiny of Boeing just as it was trying to move on from two fatal crashes of its bestselling plane.\n\nBoeing announced Ortberg's appointment alongside a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and a 15% drop in sales.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" Boeing chairman Steven Mollenkopf said in note to employees on Wednesday.\n\nOrtberg will also join Boeing's board.\n\nBoeing has in recent months tried to move past its production and safety crises, including the continued fallout from two deadly crashes of its Max planes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nEarlier this month it pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge that said it misled regulators about the Max planes before they were certified. The agreement requires an independent corporate monitor at the company for three years.\n\nAs CEO, Ortberg will have to ensure quality of Boeing's products that depend on a strained and massive supply chain. The company, which employs some 170,000 people, has to train thousands of new employees who replaced more experienced staff who left in the pandemic, a challenge Boeing's suppliers are also facing.\n\nThe midair door plug blowout put Boeing's leaders back in crisis mode, though there weren't any serious injuries among passengers or crew. Bolts to hold the door panel in place weren't installed at Boeing's Renton, Washington, factory, according to early accident reports.\n\nThat accident was the most serious of a host of manufacturing flaws that also included misdrilled holes and incorrect spacing on fuselages, problems that have slowed deliveries, depriving the company of cash and customers of new planes.\n\nBoeing reached a deal earlier this month to buy Spirit AeroSystems, its fuselage supplier it previously owned. Many of the recent problems originated there and Boeing's leaders have said the acquisition Boeing's leaders have said will help them get a better handle on quality after years of outsourcing, a practice that outgoing CEO Calhoun said earlier this year likely went \"too far.\"\n\n\"One person cannot turn around a company, but Kelly should be able to cast a wider net for talent than a Boeing insider could,\" Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein said in a note Wednesday. \"Also, we note that Rockwell Collins fostered a strong culture, something that we think Boeing is in dire need of now.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collins Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Fleet_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Fleet Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240731-Kelly-Ortberg-ch-1120-a08247.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 322, "textEnd": 328}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 848, "textEnd": 855}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg in a statement from the company. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.\"\n\nOrtberg, who noted \"there is much work to be done\" at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing's management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.\n\nBut Ortberg's appointment doesn't necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company's new leadership. While Calhoun's background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.\n\nOrtberg started work in the aviation industry in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager. He became CEO of Rockwell Collins in 2013, and retired from the company in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" said Boeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nRockwell Collins provides avionics, the electrical systems used on aircraft, and information technology used in the aerospace industry. It was purchased by United Technologies in 2018 and now operates as Collins Aerospace. Ortberg stayed with the company for three years as it was integrated into United Technologies, and then he retired.\n\nHe will have his hands full fixing the problems at Boeing, which has not posted a profitable year since 2019. Since then, its core operating losses totaled $33.3 billion, including the loss announced Wednesday. Boeing will have difficulty returning to profitability until it can convince regulators that it has fixed problems with the safety and quality of its jets.\n\n- This is a developing story, it will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The loss was broader and revenue lower than anticipated by Wall Street, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit operated at a loss.\n\nThe unsatisfactory outcomes come at a chaotic period for Boeing. The company consented to plead guilty to deceitfulness regarding the Max, two of which crashed, leading to the tragic deaths of 346 individuals. The Federal Aviation Administration has heightened its supervision of the company following errors, such as the explosion of a panel on an Alaska Airlines aircraft. It is resisting whistleblower claims of production shortcuts that compromise safety.\n\nThe company is grappling with supply-chain obstacles that are impeding production, which it aims to resolve in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a critical contractor. It is still striving to convince regulators to authorize two new models of the Max and an expanded version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. Additionally, it faces a significant decision worth billions on when to develop a new single-aisle aircraft to replace the Max.\n\nOrtberg will assume the roles of CEO and president on Aug. 8, Boeing confirmed. He emerged as a leading contender only recently. Other individuals reportedly under consideration for the position included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who now serves as CEO of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another experienced Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently assumed leadership of the commercial-airplanes division.\n\nChairman Steven Mollenkopf stated that Ortberg was selected after a \"comprehensive and exhaustive search process\" and \"possesses the appropriate expertise and experience to guide Boeing in its subsequent phase.\"\n\nMollenkopf mentioned that Ortberg has built a reputation for managing intricate engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nA spokesperson from Boeing revealed that the company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg. Boeing took a similar step for Calhoun shortly after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nBoeing, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, in contrast to a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding extraordinary items, the loss amounted to $2.90 per share. Analysts had projected a loss of $1.90 per share, as per a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue decreased by 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of the average forecast of $17.35 billion from Wall Street.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division incurred an operating loss of $715 million, and revenue plummeted by 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared to 136 the previous year.\n\nThe FAA has restricted Boeing's production of Max jetliners since soon after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing has not yet reached the FAA limitations as it works on rectifying its production process. The company affirmed on Wednesday that it is adhering to its plans to increase Max production to 38 per month by the end of the year.\n\nBoeing recorded a charge of $244 million to cover a penalty that it will pay as part of an arrangement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to deceitfulness in connection with the development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon decide whether to approve the agreement, which is opposed by many families of those who perished in the two Max crashes.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit suffered a $913 million loss due to $1 billion in setbacks on four fixed-price government contracts, including an agreement to construct two new Air Force One presidential jets. Meanwhile, the smaller services division generated $870 million in earnings.\n\nBoeing shares increased by 2% in premarket trading.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Fleet_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Fleet Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Boeing-appoints-new-CEO-amidst-second-quarter-loss-exceeding-14.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 326, "textEnd": 332, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Several candidates, including Stephanie Pope and Patrick Shanahan, are also being considered for the CEO role. The next Boeing CEO will face the challenge of rebuilding customer confidence while reshaping the company's strategy.\n\nAnother name has been added to the list of contenders being considered to lead Boeing after its current CEO, Dave Calhoun, steps down at the end of this year. According to reports, former Rockwell Collins chief Kelly Ortberg is also in the running to become the plane manufacturer's top boss, and that a decision could be taken soon.\n\nEx-Rockwell Collins leader being considered\n\nAccording to a report by The Air Current, former Rockwell Collins chief Kelly Ortberg is now part of the list of candidates being considered to replace Boeing's current CEO, Dave Calhoun. The report says that Ortberg is actually a serious outside contender for the role and that Boeing wants to make a decision \"sooner than later.\"\n\nOrtberg has more than three decades of experience in aerospace and defense space and has held several executive positions. He holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa.\n\nRockwell Collins is a significant producer of aircraft communications, electronics, and aviation systems and has several customers in the commercial and military aviation space. Ortberg headed the company for eight years and retired in 2021 as an adviser to the CEO of RTX. He led the company through various phases, including mergers and restructuring.\n\nWhile Ortberg is said to be in serious consideration for Boeing's CEO position, there are others who are also in the race. The Air Current reports that a final choice could emerge as soon as this week.\n\nPhoto: Wirestock Creators | Shutterstock Other candidates\n\nEver since Calhoun announced his decision to step down as Boeing's CEO, several names have emerged to replace him. Among them is Stephanie Pope, who not too long ago was named the COO of Boeing. Patrick Shanahan, head of Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, is also said to be in the race.\n\nRelated Future Boeing CEO? Stephanie Pope Snags COO Role\n\nThe industry veteran has been with the aerospace company for nearly three decades.\n\n5\n\nAnother name that emerged earlier this year was David Gitlin, Carrier Global CEO and a Boeing director, due to his long and successful career in the aerospace industry. In June, it was also reported that GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp turned down the request to replace Calhoun.\n\nSearch continues\n\nBoeing is perhaps going through its toughest crisis yet. Just when it seemed that it was recovering successfully from the two fatal 737 MAX crashes a few years ago, the Alaska Airlines midair blowout incident brought the focus back on its substandard manufacturing processes.\n\nWith airlines losing confidence in Boeing, Dave Calhoun announced his decision to step down.

Though no one was killed, some passengers were injured, and the accident recalled twin fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that the company has struggled to put behind it.\n\nOrtberg is an experienced leader \"with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies\", said Boeing's chair Steven Mollenkopf, who led the search for Calhoun's replacement. \"Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old led Rockwell Collins, which makes avionics and cabin equipment, for five years and helped oversee its $30bn tie-up in 2017 with United Technologies. Now known as Collins Aerospace, it is part of defense contractor RTX.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg. \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nHis appointment comes as Boeing reported a $1.4BN second-quarter loss, far larger than Wall Street expected. The quarter was marked by $1BN in losses tied to fixed-price defense contracts and fewer plane deliveries. The company also reported a $2.90/share loss, far bigger than the $1.97 loss expected, on revenue which tumbled from $19.8 billion to just $16.9 billion, also missing estimates of $17.2 billion.\n\nAnd the cherry on top of another gruesome quarter is that Boeing burned through a near-record $4.3 billion in cash, matching the worst quarters in the immediate aftermath of its 737 MAX crisis...\n\n.... and sending the company's total debt soaring higher by $10 billion (and net debt rising by $5 billion).\n\nStill, despite the dismal earnings, Boeing shares rose 2% as Ortberg's recruitment ended months of speculation over who would take on the multiple challenges facing the company, and has given investors some hope that the epic shitshow that is Boeing's DEI-infused operations in the past five years will finally normalize.\n\nOrtberg began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, before joining Rockwell Collins as a programme manager. As reported previously, many in the aerospace industry had strongly favored an engineer taking the top job at Boeing, with critics suggesting it had prioritized shareholder returns (and DEI virtue signaling) over investment in engineering and innovation.\n\nThe new CEO will be under immediate pressure to restore confidence in the quality and safety of Boeing's manufacturing operations, as well as finding ways to ease the supply chain strains that have hobbled the industry since the pandemic.\n\nBoeing's airline customers have been angered by delays in plane deliveries during a period in which rival Airbus has won market share.\n\nRob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said Ortberg was a \"very good hire\".\n\n\"While he may not be as well known as say Larry Culp (GE) or Dave Gitlin (Carrier), in our experience Kelly was an excellent CEO of Rockwell Collins,\" Stallard said. \"What he brings to the party is not only a wealth of A&D experience, but also a record of running a company with an excellent corporate culture. Clearly there are a massive number of problems at Boeing, but with Kelly as CEO we think there is at least a chance of fixing them.\"\n\nNot that the new CEO is blemish-free: Ortberg will join after Boeing pleaded guilty on July 24 to a felony fraud charge for misleading the US Federal Aviation Administration.

Ortberg, 64, is an engineer by training who rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins, an aviation supplier that's now part of RTX. He will take up his role on Aug 8.\n\nBoeing rose as investors welcomed the end to months of uncertainty after current CEO Dave Calhoun announced in March he would step down. The planemaker is working to placate frustrated airlines and win back the trust of US regulators and the flying public after a near-catastrophe in January was linked to a breakdown in quality controls in its 737 factory outside of Seattle.\n\n\"Ortberg's appointment is the best news for Boeing in a long time,\" said Nick Cunningham, an aviation analyst at Agency Partners in London. \"Right now, Boeing needs a company doctor to come in, turn over every stone, tell everyone the bad news, take the charges needed and then bring about an effective turnaround.\"\n\nOrtberg will take over a company that's seen its finances badly dented from the fallout of the January accident. The planemaker said on Wednesday that it burned through US$4.33 billion in cash. That's after a similar outflow in the first three months, as Boeing slowed down output of its commercial jet factories.\n\nBoeing's defence and space division suffered its worst quarter since mid-2023 as costs ballooned to convert a pair of 747 jumbo jets into the next presidential Air Force One fleet. The company said it recorded US$1 billion of losses on fixed-price contracts, including a loss on the KC-46 military tanker programme.\n\nThe defence stumbles are a reminder that Boeing's operational difficulties extend well beyond its crisis-stricken commercial division. The company has gradually been stepping up output in its 737 Max jets under close supervision by federal regulators, but faces another crisis with a strike deadline looming in September for Seattle-area factory workers.\n\nThe company said it still expects to increase production of the 737 Max to 38 planes a month, and the 787 Dreamliner to 5 a month by year-end.\n\nWith the appointment, Ortberg steps out of retirement and into the leadership role that many once expected him to play at RTX, one of Boeing's biggest suppliers and the parent to enginemaker Pratt & Whitney. He briefly ran Collins Aerospace before shifting to an advisory role and eventually RTX's board in 2020.\n\nAt Rockwell Collins, Ortberg had a track record as dealmaker - striking his first major acquisition just 11 days after taking over as CEO. He was known for his blunt, no-nonsense style and his effort to flatten hierarchy.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,\" said Boeing Chairman Steve Mollenkopf, who led the search for the new CEO. Boeing said it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, as it did in 2021 for Calhoun.\n\nOrtberg was the rare executive to openly criticise a Boeing at a time when the US planemaker held huge sway over its subcontractors. Ortberg called out the manufacturer as \"delinquent\" in 2016, after it abruptly switched payment terms from 30 days to as long as four months, squeezing working capital for its suppliers.\n\nHe eventually joined the consolidation wave, selling the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace company to United Technologies, which later combined with Raytheon Technologies, now RTX. At the time, it was the biggest acquisition in aviation history.\n\nBoeing picked Ortberg as it works through one of the most tumultuous periods in the company's recent past. In January, a fuselage panel blew out of an almost-new 737 Max 9 airliner during flight, which investigators attributed to missing bolts in the so-called door plug segment.\n\nWhile nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, it set off a cascade of developments, from Calhoun's departure to a regulatory clampdown to Boeing pleading guilty to felony charges connected to two previous accidents.\n\nCalhoun will continue to serve as special adviser until March 2025. As part of his decision to step down, Boeing also named Stephanie Pope as new head of its commercial aviation business earlier this year. Pope, 52, was seen as the most promising internal candidate for the CEO job.\n\n\"There is some credence to bringing in an outsider who has a strong working knowledge of Boeing, but no direct current tie,\" said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu in a July 29 note.

Communications skills are also critical, in part to be able to navigate congressional hearings and other politically-oriented venues.\n\nIn Wednesday's press release, Mollenkopf described Ortberg as \"an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,\" according to a message to employees.\n\nOrtberg said \"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" according to the press release. \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nRepresentative Rick Larsen, the senior Democrat on a key House Transportation Committee, said on X that was \"encouraged\" by the appointment.\n\n\"Mr. Ortberg is a mechanical engineer,\" Larsen said. \"I hope that means he will ensure that his top message for everyone is building the best airplane means building the safest airplane in the world.\"\n\nOrtberg is set to take office on August 8, just after a two-day hearing organized by the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington on the Alaska Airlines incident.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines incident raised fresh scrutiny on Boeing and the MAX following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that led to a lengthy grounding of the plane.\n\nBoeing agreed to plead guilty to a fraud charge in connection with the MAX certification as part of a plea deal with the Department of Justice, US officials announced July

Ortberg, 64, is an engineer by training who rose through the ranks at Rockwell Collins, an aviation supplier that's now part of RTX Corp.He will take on the new role on Aug. 8.\n\nBoeing rose as much as 2.7% as investors parsed the surprise appointment that ended months of uncertainty after current CEO Dave Calhoun announced in March he would step down. The planemaker is working to placate frustrated airlines and win back the trust of US regulators and the flying public after a near-catastrophe in January was linked to a breakdown in quality controls in its 737 factory outside of Seattle.\n\n\"Ortberg's appointment is the best news for Boeing in a long time,\" said Nick Cunningham, an aviation analyst at Agency Partners in London. \"Right now, Boeing needs a company doctor to come in, turn over every stone, tell everyone the bad news, take the charges needed and then bring about an effective turnaround.\"\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nThe media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.\n\nOrtberg will take over a company that's seen its finances badly dented from the fallout of the January accident. The stock has lost 27% in value this year, which puts it on track for its worst annual performance since 2020.\n\nAmong his biggest tasks will be to \"incentivize and foster continuous problem solving and collaboration on the shop floor, said Nicolas Owens, industrials equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services LLC.\n\n\"The real test for any Boeing CEO will be navigating the very long cycle and high cost of investment in new plane designs, which can be tricky because the rewards accrue in decades, not years,\" Owens said.\n\nThe planemaker said on Wednesday that it burned through $4.33 billion in cash during the second quarter. That's after a similar outflow in the first three months, as Boeing slowed down output of its commercial jet factories.\n\nBoeing's defense and space division suffered its worst quarter since mid-2023 as costs ballooned to convert a pair of 747 jumbo jets into the next presidential Air Force One fleet. The company said it recorded $1 billion of losses on fixed-price contracts, including a loss on the KC-46 military tanker program.\n\nThe defense stumbles are a reminder that Boeing's operational difficulties extend well beyond its crisis-stricken commercial division. The company has gradually been stepping up output in its 737 Max jets under close supervision by federal regulators, but faces another crisis with a strike deadline looming in September for Seattle-area factory workers.\n\nThe company said it still expects to increase production of the 737 Max to 38 planes a month, and the 787 Dreamliner to 5 a month by year-end.\n\n'Experienced leader'\n\nWith the appointment, Ortberg steps out of retirement and into the leadership role that many once expected him to play at RTX, one of Boeing's biggest suppliers and the parent to enginemaker Pratt & Whitney. He briefly ran Collins Aerospace before shifting to an advisory role and eventually RTX's board in 2020.\n\nAt Rockwell Collins, Ortberg had a track record as dealmaker -- striking his first major acquisition just 11 days after taking over as CEO. He was known for his blunt, no-nonsense style and his effort to flatten hierarchy.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,\" said Boeing Chairman Steve Mollenkopf, who led the search for the new CEO. Boeing said it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, as it did in 2021 for Calhoun.\n\nOrtberg was the rare executive to openly criticize Boeing at a time when the US planemaker held huge sway over its subcontractors. Ortberg called out the manufacturer as \"delinquent\" in 2016, after it abruptly switched payment terms from 30 days to as long as four months, squeezing working capital for its suppliers.\n\nLeadership shuffle\n\nHe eventually joined the consolidation wave, selling the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace company to United Technologies Corp., which later combined with Raytheon Technologies Corp, now RTX. At the time, it was the biggest acquisition in aviation history.\n\nBoeing picked Ortberg as it works through one of the most tumultuous periods in the company's history. In January, a fuselage panel blew out of an almost-new 737 Max 9 airliner during flight, which investigators attributed to missing bolts in the so-called door plug segment.\n\nWhile nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, it set off a cascade of developments, from Calhoun's departure to a regulatory clampdown to Boeing pleading guilty to felony charges connected to two previous accidents.\n\nCalhoun will continue to serve as special adviser until March 2025. As part of his decision to step down, Boeing also named Stephanie Pope as new head of its commercial aviation business earlier this year.

He will start on Aug. 8.\n\nThe appointment lifted the shares of the planemaker 1.4% in early trading even as it posted a bigger loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter due to struggles at its defense and space business.\n\nOne of the two global planemakers, Boeing has been mired in a reputational and safety crisis after a Jan. 5 mid-air cabin panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines-operated MAX 9 jet carrying 171 passengers.\n\nThat led to an executive reshuffle in which CEO Dave Calhoun decided to step down by the end of the year and board chair Larry Kellner said he would not stand for re-election.\n\nCalhoun will be a special advisor to the board until March 2025, Boeing chair Steve Mollenkopf said on Wednesday.\n\nShortly after the January accident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from raising the production of its cash-cow 737 MAX family of jets above 38 a month, without estimating how long the limitation will last.\n\nHowever, Boeing has been making aircraft below that level during some weeks to plug quality gaps, Reuters has reported.\n\nWALL ST CHEERS APPOINTMENT\n\nA mechanical engineer, Ortberg has put more than 30 years in aerospace and defense, including numerous executive roles.\n\nAfter five years leading Rockwell Collins, he steered the company's integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement from RTX in 2021.\n\n\"This is a strong and safe pick. We can appreciate Ortberg's age may be higher than some investors would have liked to see. However, we believe Ortberg's reputation at Rockwell Collins and United Technologies/RTX is strong,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Ken Herbert said in a note.\n\nOrtberg's experience in integrating acquisitions such as steering Collins through an $8.3 billion deal to purchase BE Aerospace in 2016 will face a fresh test at Boeing.\n\nThe planemaker is working to integrate Spirit AeroSystems into its fold after clinching a deal earlier this year to buy back the fuselage maker.\n\nHis appointment also addresses industry push for hiring an outsider to steer Boeing out of its troubles.\n\nOrtberg is a \"tough negotiator\" capable of dealing with a diverse set of customers and suppliers, Jefferies said in a note published after industry publication Air Current reported that Ortberg was a serious contender.\n\nIn the race for one of the top industrial jobs, he pipped Patrick Shanahan, the former Spirit Aero CEO who was seen as a favorite to succeed Calhoun by some analysts and investors.\n\n\"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started,\" Ortberg said in a statement as Boeing waived its mandatory retirement age of 65 years for him.\n\n\"A strong Boeing is great for Southwest Airlines and it's great for our industry,\" said CEO Bob Jordan whose airline is a loyal Boeing customer and among the worst hit by the planemaker's production woes.\n\nDEFENCE BUSINESS STRUGGLES\n\nDuring the second quarter, Boeing delivered a total of 92 aircraft, down 32% from last year. It posted a loss of $2.33 a share, as its troubled defense and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the company.\n\nThe Defense, Space and Security unit, one of Boeing's three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defense contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented U.S. corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/07/1e8de5f62e842d1db41dbfe92c4116c7-85584611.jpg?fit=4096,2398", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 414}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 715, "textEnd": 721}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He has held the role of president and CEO since January 2020, and served as a member of Boeing's Board of Directors since 2009. Boeing's shareholders re-elected Calhoun to the Board of Directors this May during the company's annual general meeting.\n\n\"The Board conducted a thorough and extensive search process over the last several months to select the next CEO of Boeing and Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter,\" said Steven Mollenkopf, Chair of the Board at Boeing in a statement. \"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies. We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nMollenkopf also thanked Dave Calhoun on behalf of the Board for stepping in \"to steer the company through the challenges of recent years.\" Calhoun took the helm of Boeing during the last 737 MAX crisis, when the global fleet was grounded due to two deadly crashes. He further led the company through the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a devastating impact on airlines and the aerospace industry.\n\nRumors that Ortberg might take the leading role at the embattled aerospace giant emerged during the Farnborough International Airshow. Other contenders included Spirt AeroSystems' CEO Pat Shanahan and Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope.\n\nOrtberg, who is 64-years-old, brings 35-years of aerospace leadership experience to the role and possesses a strong engineering background, something that Boeing prioritizes in leadership. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa and joined Rockwell Collins as a program manager in 1987. He also steered the company's integration with United Technologies. No doubt some of that experience will be required as Boeing works to re-integrate Spirit Aerosystems.\n\nBased on what Calhoun has previously said of the role of his successor during this crisis, Ortberg will need to focus on engaging with employees and building trust.\n\n\"We will try to select people who know a lot about airplanes. We are weird. We are in an industry where domain expertise matters a lot,\" Calhoun told Senators during a hearing on the Boeing 737 MAX program in June. \"And so we do prefer to choose from within, but we also do our best to match the skill sets with the opportunity. Right now, the immediate opportunity, and I think your committee has helped us point this out along with everything we've learned in the stand downs and the accidents, is: engagement, engagement, engagement, engagement.

The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet. It is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety.\n\nThe company is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe company reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nKelly Ortbeg, 64, has 35 years of aerospace leadership that he'll bring to his new role.\n\nHe has a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineer from the University of Iowa, and started his career in 1983 as an engineer with Texas Instruments.\n\nIn 1987, he joined Rockwell Collins as a program manager and held increasingly important leadership positions at the company prior to becoming its president and CEO in 2013.\n\nOrtberg helped Rockwell Collins's integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement from RTX in 2021.\n\nHe also served on the Board of Directors of RTX, on the Board of Directors of Aptiv PLC, and is the former Chair of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) Board of Governors.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" said Ortberg. \"Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I'm committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront. There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nOrtberg will succeed Dave Calhoun, who announced earlier this year that he would step down as the CEO after serving as president and CEO since January 2020 and as a Board of Directors member since 2009.\n\nIn addition to Calhoun's departure, the company also announced that Board Chair Larry Kellner did not intend to stand for re-election. The board elected Mollenkopf to succeed Kellner as independent board chair in this role. Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Stan Deal also retired from the company and Stephanie Pope was appointed to lead BCA.\n\nThis is a developing story, and will be updated.\n\nA panel that blew off a Boeing jet will get star billing during a Washington hearing\n\nBoeing admits defrauding US government, forced to pay hundreds of millions\n\nUS files details of Boeing's plea deal related to plane crashes.

Shares rose 2.9% before the bell.\n\nBoeing, one of two global plane makers, has been mired in a reputational and safety crisis after a Jan. 5 midair panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines-operated Max 9 jet carrying 171 passengers. It posted a $1.4 billion loss in the second quarter as it continues to burn cash.\n\nThe accident eventually led to the resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and the departure of the company's previous board president as regulators took aim at the safety culture that was already shaken by previous crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nShortly after the accident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from expanding production of its cash-cow 737 Max family of jets without estimating how long the limitation would last.\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator capped production at 38 jets per month, though Reuters reported that Boeing had been producing jets at a much lower level for some weeks.\n\nOn Feb. 28, the regulator gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues,\" which the company submitted in May.\n\nHowever, the FAA's administrator has said Boeing would not be immediately allowed to increase 737 Max production.\n\n\"During his leadership at Collins, he was well liked by employees and direct reports and very personable,\" Jefferies analysts said in a note from earlier this week, after industry publication the Air Current reported Ortberg was a serious contender.\n\nJefferies said he was a \"tough negotiator\" dealing with diverse customers and suppliers.\n\nA mechanical engineer, Ortberg has more than 30 years of experience in aerospace and defense, including numerous executive roles. After five years leading Rockwell Collins, he steered the company's integration with United Technologies and RTX until he retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nHe pipped Patrick Shanahan to one of the top industrial jobs after the former Spirit Aero CEO was seen as a favorite for succeeding Calhoun by some analysts and investors.\n\n\"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started,\" Ortberg said in a statement.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Boeing delivered 92 aircraft, down 32% from last year. It posted a loss of $2.33 a share, as its troubled defense and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the company.\n\nThe Defense, Space, and Security unit, one of Boeing's three main businesses, lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022. Executives attributed this to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defense contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented U.S. corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dailysabah.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_West_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian West (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick M.

candidate has reportedly joined the race to succeed departing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, aiming to guide the company through a period marked by numerous scandals.\n\nKelly Ortberg has emerged as a contender for the top job at the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer, according to trade publication The Air Current, citing \"multiple industry officials.\"\n\nOrtberg is the former CEO of Rockwell Collins, a company which provided aviation systems and technology services to commercial customers and government agencies until it was purchased by United Technologies in November 2018.\n\nOrtberg currently serves on the board of directors of Aptiv, an automotive technology supplier, and as co-chair of the board of directors for FIRST, an organization which hosts annual high-school robotics competitions.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Boeing to inquire about Ortberg's candidacy, and to ask when the new CEO will be chosen.\n\nOrtberg joins a handful of other potential replacements for Dave Calhoun, who will be stepping down at the end of the year.\n\nCalhoun has led the aerospace giant since 2020, after his predecessor Dennis Muilenburg was fired in the wake of the 2018 and 2019 737 MAX crashes.\n\nIn March, however, Calhoun announced that he would be leaving the company, kicking off the search for his successor.\n\nHis announcement came amid increased scrutiny of the company following the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing aircraft mid-flight, and caused the airline to ground its entire fleet of 737 MAX 9s.\n\nBesides Ortberg, the other major contenders include Stephanie Pope and Patrick Shanahan.\n\nPope is currently the chief operating officer at Boeing, and CEO of the company's Commercial Airplanes division.\n\nAnalysts previously told Newsweek that Pope's tenure with Boeing - having joined the company in 1994 - made her a strong internal candidate.\n\nShanahan is the president and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems, and previously served as Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense between January and June 2019.\n\nShanahan became one of the favorites in early July, after Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit, the supplier which had spun off from the company in 2005, in a deal Boeing said was worth $8.3 billion.\n\nReuters also identified Boeing Chair Steve Mollenkopf as a potential replacement for Calhoun.\n\nErnest Arvai, president of aviation consultancy group AirInsight, previously told Newsweek that Pope and Shanahan's long-standing association with Boeing has deeply ingrained them in the company's culture, potentially hindering their ability to implement the wide-ranging changes that Boeing needs.\n\nBoeing has yet to make a decision, but industry sources told The Air Current that the company wants to make a decision \"sooner rather than later.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hugh_cameron@newsweek.com", "name": "Hugh Cameron",

He'll have to strengthen relations between Boeing and the airlines that are its biggest customers, and earn trust with the regulators and lawmakers that have put the company under a microscope following a January 5 mid-air panel blowout that turned into a full-blown safety crisis.\n\nOrtberg has a background that threads a delicate needle. He's a company outsider but an industry insider, which industry officials said positions him as able to change the company's culture without upending its aerospace roots.\n\nBut questions remained about whether he would drive radical change favored by some politicians and industry analysts.\n\nBob Jordan, CEO of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said the company looks forward \"to working with Kelly Ortberg in his efforts to return Boeing to its place as the leading American aerospace company.\"\n\nOrtberg became CEO of key aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins in 2013 and steered the company's integration with United Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and RTX until his retirement in 2021. He also served as chair of the U.S. aerospace advocacy group Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"This is as clear a break from the past as you can imagine,\" said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nIndustry insiders had previously hoped Boeing would hire someone on the younger side, in the expectation that it will take years to turn the company around.

It posted a loss of $2.33 a share, as its troubled defence and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the company.\n\nThe Defense, Space and Security unit, one of Boeing's three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defence contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented US corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_West_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian West (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick M.

The aerospace industry publication The Air Current reported Sunday that former Rockwell Collins CEO Kelly Ortberg is being considered as a replacement for outgoing Boeing head Dave Calhoun.\n\nThe planemaker is in search of a new leader after one of its 737 Max 9 jets suffered a door plug blowout in January. Since then, the company lost all the momentum from its hoped-for comeback after its last 737 Max mess. Calhoun is retiring at the end of the year.\n\nAs Rockwell Collins CEO, Ortberg led a major supplier of flight controls and in-flight entertainment systems.

The industry publication Aviation Week reported last month that a poll of the aerospace industry suppliers revealed that 30% of them expect her to be named CEO.\n\nAnother name is Pat Shanahan, the CEO of Spirit Aerosystems.

There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nOrtberg holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa. His career started in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments. He then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager and was promoted several times prior to becoming its president and CEO in 2013.\n\nAfter taking the corner office at what was a key avionics supplier, Ortberg began a long march of massive mergers and acquisitions that both redrew the industrial landscape in aerospace, and helped propel Rockwell from a niche supplier to a key Tier 1. Ortberg drove Rockwell's acquisition of flight-services provider Arinc for $1.4 billion and cabin interiors provider B/E Aerospace for $8.3 billion, until unveiling Rockwell's own 2018 merger with United Technologies for $30 billion. Rockwell was combined with then-UTC Aerospace Systems to form the Collins Aerospace division. In April 2020, parent United Technologies merged with large defense prime Raytheon to form Raytheon Technologies, later renamed RTX.\n\nUnder Ortberg's tenure, Rockwell expanded at a 14% compound annual growth rate, from $4 billion in 2013 revs to $9 billion when it was sold to United Technologies, according to Jefferies analysts.\n\nOrtberg quietly served then-RTX Chairman and CEO Greg Hayes until Ortberg retired from executives in March 2021. His absence was noted by several observers in the industry who wondered how the aerospace industry could let someone as respected and proven slip away. His name would periodically surface when CEO searches were known to be occurring at various companies, and indeed, his name was floated as a potential Boeing CEO before Calhoun was appointed in January 2020.\n\nAnalysts see the logic in Ortberg's appointment now.\n\n\"We believe during his leadership at Collins he was well liked by employees and direct reports and very personable,\" said the Jefferies team, led by Sheila Kahyaoglu. \"This was while being a tough negotiator dealing with a diverse set of customers and suppliers and managing the complexity of its diverse customer base, which included negotiating through Boeing's Partnering for Success.\" Ortberg also clearly has experience with major acquisitions and corporate restructuring.\n\n\"There is some credence to bringing in an outsider who has a strong working knowledge of Boeing, but no direct current tie,\" the analysts continued. \"This fresh start includes ensuring a healthy supply chain, while ensuring a content employee base and navigating the current union negotiation.\"\n\nOrtberg has bested a short list of other candidates who were widely talked about as contenders for the top Boeing job, including current COO Stephanie Pope, current Spirit CEO Pat Shanahan, and others. Pope was believed to be Calhoun's personal choice as she was appointed companywide COO at the start of this year, and in the spring took over Boeing Commercial Airplanes from Stan Deal.

He'll have to strengthen relations between Boeing and the airlines that are its biggest customers, and earn trust with the regulators and lawmakers that have put the company under a microscope following a January 5 mid-air panel blowout that turned into a full-blown safety crisis. Ortberg has a background that threads a delicate needle. He's a company outsider but an industry insider, which industry officials said positions him as able to change the company's culture without upending its aerospace roots.\n\nBut questions remained about whether he would drive radical change favored by some politicians and industry analysts. Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest Airlines said the company looks forward \"to working with Kelly Ortberg in his efforts to return Boeing to its place as the leading American aerospace company.\"\n\nOrtberg became CEO of key aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins in 2013 and steered the company's integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement in 2021. He also served as chair of the U.S. aerospace advocacy group Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"This is as clear a break from the past as you can imagine,\" said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. Industry insiders had previously hoped Boeing would hire someone on the younger side, in the expectation that it will take years to turn the company around. Ortberg is 64, however, and Boeing said it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 just like it did for CEO Dave Calhoun, who is departing after a management shakeup earlier this year. AeroDynamic Advisory analyst Kevin Michaels, who first met Ortberg at Rockwell Collins in 1996, said Ortberg is young-looking and energetic and he didn't see his age as a barrier for the top job. \"We all thought that he retired too young,\" Michaels said. Ortberg is said to have beaten out Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope and Spirit AeroSystems boss and former Boeing executive Pat Shanahan for the job.\n\n\"I think it's a positive,\" said one portfolio manager that holds Boeing stock. \"The narrative had been, 'I can't believe only Boeing insiders wanted this job.'\" Boeing had faced pressure from industry executives and U.S. lawmakers to choose new leadership with an engineering background and without lengthy ties to the company. Whether that is enough for lawmakers scrutinizing Boeing's operations remains to be seen.\n\n\"Mr. Ortberg is a mechanical engineer. I hope that means he will ensure that his top message for everyone is building the best airplane means building the safest airplane in the world,\" said Rep Rick Larsen, top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee who represents a district in Washington State home to major Boeing operations. Analysts and acquaintances described Ortberg as being a good listener, honest and willing to take decisive action. \"We believe during his leadership at Collins he was well liked by employees and direct reports and very personable,\" said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu in a note.\n\n\"This was while being a tough negotiator dealing with a diverse set of customers and suppliers and managing the complexity of its diverse customer base.\"\n\n(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal.

The troubled airplane-maker also reported a wider-than-expected second quarter loss and revenue miss.\n\n\"The Board conducted a thorough and extensive search process over the last several months to select the next CEO of Boeing and Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter,\" said Boeing chairman Steven Mollenkopf in a statement.\n\nOrtberg will start Aug. 8 and has been named to the Boeing board.\n\nHe will inherit an aerospace giant that has faced an extraordinarily turbulent year, which was reflected in its second-quarter earnings report. Boeing reported revenue of $16.9 billion vs. $17.46 billion estimated per Bloomberg. The company also posted an adjusted loss per share of $2.90 vs. $1.82 estimated, resulting in a core operating loss of $1.392 billion.\n\nFree-cash flow burn hit $4.3 billion, topping the nearly $4 billion it did lost in Q1, meaning the company could reported an astounding $8.256 billion in negative free cash flow for the first half of the year.\n\nBoeing stock was up about 3% in pre-market trading. The stock is down over 25% this year.\n\nNot surprisingly, Boeing's commercial deliveries took a hit in the second quarter as well. Boeing delivered 92 commercial jets in Q2, down from the 136 planes delivered year ago, or a 32% drop. The 737 Max program had 70 deliveries in Q2, down from the 103 delivered a year ago.\n\nBefore its recent issues, Boeing had monthly production target of 38 737 MAX jets, with a stretch goal of 50 planes per month. Boeing confirmed that it intends to hit the 38 plane goal by the end of the year.\n\nBoeing also delivered nine widebody Dreamliner jets in Q2, down from 20 a year ago. The Dreamliner jet has been the subject of a few whistleblower complaints in 2024 alone, highlighting more issues with Boeing's production and assembly processes. Boeing said it plans to return to 5 787 produced per month\n\nBoeing pulled its full-year outlook at the start of the year given the issues it was facing, most seriously at the time the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout in January.\n\n\"Despite a challenging quarter, we are making substantial progress strengthening our quality management system and positioning our company for the future,\" said Dave Calhoun, outgoing Boeing president and CEO.\n\nHe added: \"We are executing on our comprehensive safety and quality plan and have reached an agreement to acquire Spirit AeroSystems. While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations and ensure Boeing is the company the world needs it to be. We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency.\"\n\nBoeing also pleaded guilty last week to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and agreed to pay at least $243.6 million after breaching a 2021 consent decree with the Department of Justice, with the government alleging Boeing continued risky procedures in plane construction and didn't keep accurate records following the two 737 MAX crashes in 2019 and 2020.\n\nFamilies of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, who have been vocal about Boeing getting off too lightly given the seriousness of the charges, are challenging the Boeing's plea deal and have filed a motion to oppose it -- meaning Boeing isn't out of the legal jeopardy, yet.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

The loss was wider and revenue lower than Wall Street expected, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet.

He emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial-airplanes division.\n\nChairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\n\nMollenkopf said Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said the company had waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, reported a loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion.\n\nThe commercial-airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines -- 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA has limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners since shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine that it would pay as part of an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to fraud in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the deal, which is opposed by many families of those who died in the two Max crashes.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets. The smaller services business earned $870 million.\n\nBoeing shares added 2% in premarket trading.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ortberg, a seasoned aerospace executive, steps in following the fallout from a January incident and subsequent financial woes, including a significant quarterly loss and stagnant jet production.\n\nBoeing has named aerospace industry veteran Kelly Ortberg as its new President and CEO, effectively tasking him with the monumental challenge of revitalizing the struggling planemaker. Ortberg, who previously served as a top executive at Rockwell Collins, will assume his role on August 8. He will face the daunting task of not only reviving jet production but also rebuilding trust with regulators and the public.\n\nThe announcement comes after a troubling period for Boeing, one of two global planemaking giants. The company has been grappling with a reputational and safety crisis, highlighted by a January 5 mid-air panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines-operated MAX 9 jet carrying 171 passengers. The incident resulted in the resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and the departure of the company's previous board president. Further compounding the issue, Boeing reported a $1.4 billion loss for the quarter, exacerbated by ongoing cash flow problems.\n\nIn response to the January incident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) placed a cap on Boeing's production of its 737 MAX jets at 38 units per month. Despite this, Boeing has been producing at lower levels during some weeks. The FAA has mandated that the company develop a comprehensive plan to address systemic quality-control issues, which was submitted in May. However, Boeing is still not permitted to increase 737 MAX production immediately. The company delivered only 92 aircraft in the second quarter, a 32% drop compared to last year, which further strained its finances. Boeing's troubled Defense, Space and Security unit also contributed heavily to the financial woes, losing billions over cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_37_21_0109025.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 626, "textEnd": 634}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 947, "textEnd": 956}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Shares rose 2.9% before the bell.\n\nBoeing, one of two global planemakers, has been mired in a reputational and safety crisis after a Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines-operated MAX 9 jet carrying 171 passengers. It posted a $1.4 billion loss in the second quarter as it continues to burn cash.\n\nThe accident eventually led to the resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and departure of the company's previous board president as regulators took aim at the safety culture that was already shaken by previous crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nShortly after the accident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from expanding production of its cash-cow 737 MAX family of jets without estimating how long the limitation will last.\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator capped production to 38 jets per month, though Reuters has reported that Boeing has been producing jets during some weeks at a much lower level.\n\nThe regulator on Feb. 28 gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues\", which the company submitted in May.\n\nHowever, the FAA's administrator has said Boeing would not be immediately allowed to increase 737 MAX production.\n\nANALYSTS CHEER APPOINTMENT\n\n\"During his leadership at Collins he was well liked by employees and direct reports and very personable,\" Jefferies analysts said in a note from earlier this week, after industry publication the Air Current reported Ortberg was a serious contender.\n\nJefferies said he was a \"tough negotiator\" dealing with a diverse set of customers and suppliers.\n\nA mechanical engineer, Ortberg has more than 30 years of experience in aerospace and defense, including numerous executive roles. After five years leading Rockwell Collins, he steered the company's integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement from RTX in 2021.\n\nHe pipped Patrick Shanahan to one of the top industrial jobs after the former Spirit Aero CEO was seen as a favorite to succeed Calhoun by some analysts and investors.\n\n\"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started,\" Ortberg said in a statement.\n\nDEFEENCE BUSINESS STRUGGLES\n\nDuring the second quarter, Boeing delivered a total of 92 aircraft, down 32% from last year. It posted a loss of $2.33 a share, as its troubled defense and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the company.\n\nThe Defense, Space and Security unit, one of Boeing's three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defense contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented U.S. corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.\n\n(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapavaram,_Eluru_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ganapavaram, Eluru district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-price_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-price contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_West_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian West (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick M.

Communications skills are also critical, in part to be able to navigate congressional hearings and other politically-oriented venues.\n\nIn Wednesday's press release, Mollenkopf described Ortberg as \"an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry,\" according to a message to employees.\n\nOrtberg said \"I'm extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,\" according to the press release. \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nRepresentative Rick Larsen, the senior Democrat on a key House Transportation Committee, said on X that was \"encouraged\" by the appointment.\n\n\"Mr. Ortberg is a mechanical engineer,\" Larsen said. \"I hope that means he will ensure that his top message for everyone is building the best airplane means building the safest airplane in the world.\"\n\nOrtberg is set to take office on August 8, just after a two-day hearing organized by the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington on the Alaska Airlines incident.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines incident raised fresh scrutiny on Boeing and the MAX following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that led to a lengthy grounding of the plane.\n\nBoeing agreed to plead guilty to a fraud charge in connection with the MAX certification as part of a plea deal with the Department of Justice, US officials announced July 24.\n\nShares of Boeing rose 1.6 percent in pre-market trading.\n\njmb/sms\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research's Kelly Richards Receives MPA Elite Women Award\n\nInvestigation finds at least 973 Native American children died in US government boarding schools\n\nChurch of Scientology Forum on the Need for Sustainability", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_biers@kulr8.com", "name": "John Biers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/6b/06bcaf81-b631-590e-8d10-10c03b14eae6/66aa47390aac4.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 414, "textEnd": 422, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-25", "textStart": 1961, "textEnd": 1969}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 3935, "textEnd": 3942}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1597, "textEnd": 1609}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Ortberg, a veteran of the aerospace industry, in charge as the company tries to recover from a crisis prompted by a panel blowing away from a 737 Max plane in January.\n\nMr. Ortberg, known as Kelly, will inherit a long list of difficult tasks. He will have to oversee sweeping cultural changes, finish contract negotiations with the company's largest union, complete the acquisition of an important supplier, stabilize production and lead development of its next generation of planes. His appointment takes effect on Aug. 8.\n\nMr. Ortberg, 64, brings decades of industry experience and an outsider's perspective to the role. He is a former chief executive of Rockwell Collins, which made electronic systems and other technology for aircraft, including those made by Boeing. Speculation about the airplane manufacturer's next chief executive had focused on other candidates for months, but Mr. Ortberg's name entered the public discussion this week after The Air Current reported that he was being considered.\n\nIndustry experts welcomed the news, noting that Mr. Ortberg is a well-regarded engineer and leader.\n\n\"This is Boeing's best day in decades,\" said Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting firm. \"Finally, there's hope for a fantastic turnaround story here. Ortberg is deeply respected in the industry, and ran a company which had one of the best cultures in the business.\"\n\nA mechanical engineer, Mr. Ortberg began his career at Texas Instruments in 1983. He joined Rockwell in 1987, quickly rising through the ranks, overseeing development programs for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 planes, and eventually becoming chief executive in 2013. He remained in that position until late 2018 when Rockwell was acquired by United Technologies. He retained a senior role at the new company until it merged with Raytheon in early 2020 and became RTX. Mr. Ortberg retired from RTX in 2021.\n\n\"Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter,\" Steven Mollenkopf, the Boeing board chairman, said in a message explaining the decision to the company's employees. \"He is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\"\n\nBoeing's board had been searching for a new chief executive since March, when Dave Calhoun announced plans to step down. Mr. Calhoun, a member of Boeing's board since 2009, became chief executive in 2020 to steer the company through crisis after two fatal crashes in which 346 people died. Mr. Calhoun will remain a special adviser to Boeing's board until March 2025.\n\nThe crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, involved the 737 Max 8 jet. After the second accident, regulators banned the plane worldwide for almost two years. The Max started flying passengers again in late 2020 and enjoyed a few relatively uneventful years. But, in January, a panel blew off a 737 Max 9 plane operated by Alaska Airlines, sparking a new crisis and raising concern about the quality of Boeing planes.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration responded by briefly grounding all Max 9 planes and increasing inspections at Boeing's factory near Seattle. The regulator also limited production of the plane and required the company to submit a comprehensive plan to improve quality and safety, which it submitted at the end of May.\n\nThe company made a raft of changes in recent months, including adding more internal inspections, increasing scrutiny of suppliers, expanding training for new hires and simplifying processes and procedures.\n\nBoeing on Wednesday also announced its financial results for the second quarter, which were generally in line with the expectations of Wall Street analysts. The company said that it is making progress toward its goal of producing 38 Max jets a month by the end of the year.\n\nThis month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a federal felony charge that stems from the Max 8 crashes in a deal with the Justice Department that will result in appointment of an independent compliance monitor at the company.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_Technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raytheon Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Aboulafia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Aboulafia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Instruments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consulting firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Boeing-Names-Robert-Ortberg-as-Its-Chief-Executive.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 608, "textEnd": 614}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

But Boeing stock climbed after the struggling plane maker appointed a new CEO to take over in early August.\n\nBoeing (BA) reported a loss of $2.90 per share adjusted, widening from a loss of 82 cents last year. FactSet analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share. Total revenue fell 15% to $16.87 billion, missing estimates of $17.35 billion.\n\nCommercial airplane revenue tumbled 32% to $6 billion, driven by a 32% drop in deliveries. Boeing delivered 92 airplanes during the quarter and it has a backlog of over 5,400 planes valued at $437 billion.\n\nThe Dow giant noted it submitted its comprehensive safety and quality plan to the Federal Aviation Administration during the quarter, following a string of mechanical issues on Boeing flights early in the year. Current CEO Dave Calhoun said Boeing is making \"substantial progress\" toward strengthening its quality management system.\n\n\"While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations,\" Calhoun said.\n\nBoeing expects to increase 737 production to 38 planes per month by the end of the year and boost 787 production to five per month.\n\nDefense, space and security revenue eased 2% to $6.02 billion, while global services revenue rose 3% to $4.89 billion.\n\nBoeing was free cash flow negative for the quarter, in the red $4.3 billion, compared to free cash flow of $2.6 billion last year.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, Boeing appointed Robert K. \"Kelly\" Ortberg to serve as the company's new president and CEO starting Aug. 8. Ortberg will succeed Calhoun, who announced his plans to retire from the plane maker earlier this year. Calhoun has led Boeing as CEO since January 2020 and has been a member of the board since 2009.\n\nOrtberg, 64, has over 35 years of leadership experience in the aerospace industry. Ortberg previously served as president and CEO of Rockwell Collins and led its integration with United Technologies in 2018, followed by the merge with RTX Corporation in 2020. He briefly served as a \"special advisor\" to the CEO of RTX before retiring from the company in 2021.\n\nBoeing Stock\n\nBoeing stock climbed 1.5% early Wednesday on the news.\n\nBA stock has rebounded from its late April lows, but shares are still down more than 28% in 2024 making it one of the worst performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nYou can follow Harrison Miller for more stock news and updates on X/Twitter @IBD_Harrison\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

Here's a comprehensive analysis of Boeing's recent performance, the challenges it faces, and what the future holds under its new leadership.\n\nQ2 Earnings Report: A Disappointing Performance\n\nBoeing's second-quarter financial results revealed a deepening loss, reporting an adjusted loss of $2.90 per share. This was significantly wider than the FactSet analysts' expected loss of $1.90 per share and a marked increase from the $0.82 per share loss in the same period last year. The company's total revenue fell by 15% to $16.87 billion, missing the estimated $17.35 billion.\n\nCommercial Airplane Segment Struggles\n\nThe commercial airplane segment faced severe challenges, with revenue plummeting 32% to $6 billion, driven by a corresponding 32% drop in deliveries. Boeing delivered 92 airplanes during the quarter, maintaining a robust backlog of over 5,400 planes valued at $437 billion. Despite the backlog, the immediate decline in deliveries and revenue underscores the operational difficulties Boeing is grappling with.\n\nEfforts to Improve Safety and Quality\n\nIn response to a series of mechanical issues earlier this year, Boeing submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Current CEO Dave Calhoun emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing its quality management system, stating, \"While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations.\"\n\nProduction Outlook\n\nBoeing ( BA ) plans to increase production of its 737 aircraft to 38 planes per month by the end of the year and boost 787 production to five planes per month. These production increases are crucial for Boeing as it aims to recover from recent setbacks and meet growing market demand.\n\nPerformance in Other Segments\n\nBoeing's defense, space, and security revenue saw a slight decline of 2% to $6.02 billion. However, the global services segment reported a 3% increase in revenue to $4.89 billion. Despite these mixed results, Boeing's diversified portfolio provides a buffer against the challenges faced in the commercial airplane segment.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Financial Health\n\nA major concern for investors is Boeing's free cash flow, which was negative $4.3 billion for the quarter, compared to a positive $2.6 billion in the same quarter last year. Managing cash flow effectively will be critical for Boeing as it balances investment in production and innovation with financial stability.\n\nStrategic Acquisition\n\nIn early July, Boeing announced a strategic acquisition, agreeing to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR ) for $4.7 billion. This deal, expected to close in mid-2025, aims to enhance Boeing's supply chain capabilities and support its long-term growth strategy.\n\nLeadership Change: A New CEO\n\nA significant development for Boeing is the appointment of Robert K. \"Kelly\" Ortberg as the company's new president and CEO, effective August 8. Ortberg, 64, brings over 35 years of leadership experience in the aerospace industry. He previously led Rockwell Collins, overseeing its integration with United Technologies and later with RTX Corporation.\n\nOrtberg will succeed Dave Calhoun, who announced his plans to retire earlier this year. Calhoun has been with Boeing since 2009 and has served as CEO since January 2020, navigating the company through significant challenges, including the 737 Max crisis and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMarket Reaction\n\nDespite the disappointing earnings report, Boeing ( BA ) stock climbed 1.5% early Wednesday on the news of Ortberg's appointment. The stock has rebounded from its late April lows but remains down more than 28% in 2024, making it one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe stock currently has a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 55.31, which suggests that there is a significant potential for strong growth in the near future. This particular figure is especially notable given that the stock has recently demonstrated a falling wedge pattern, a formation that is generally recognized as indicative of impending bullish reversals in the price trend.\n\nThis pattern is often interpreted as a precursor to an upward movement in stock prices. As a result, market participants are beginning to anticipate a decisive move toward the pivotal $217 point. Such a movement is expected to further reinforce Boeing's existing rising wedge formation, which aligns with the notion of a bullish shift in the stock's trajectory. Consequently, this anticipated behavior is likely to bolster investor confidence and enthusiasm surrounding the stock, as it suggests a positive turnaround and an upward momentum in its future performance.\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nOrtberg will face several significant challenges as he steps into his new role. Boeing ( BA ) is dealing with persistent financial losses, increased regulatory scrutiny, and a crisis of confidence from airline customers facing delivery delays. Additionally, the company is engaged in tense labor negotiations, with the threat of a strike looming.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoeing's Q2 earnings report highlighted ongoing operational and financial challenges. However, the appointment of Kelly Ortberg as CEO brings renewed optimism for the company's future. With his extensive experience and proven leadership in the aerospace industry, Ortberg is well-positioned to steer Boeing through its current difficulties and towards a more stable and prosperous future.\n\nAs Boeing ( BA ) works to enhance its safety and quality systems, ramp up production, and navigate regulatory and financial hurdles, investors will be closely watching to see if these efforts translate into a sustainable recovery and long-term growth.

Robert Kelly Ortberg, former CEO of Rockwell Collins, will take the reins as Boeing's CEO starting August 8, succeeding the retiring Dave Calhoun.\n\nOrtberg expressed his honor and humility in joining Boeing, acknowledging the company's storied past as an industry leader and pioneer. \"I'm committed to working together with our dedicated employees to continue this tradition, prioritizing safety and quality,\" he stated. His arrival is seen as timely and potentially revitalizing for Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny over the safety and quality of its planes in recent years.\n\nHaving started his career as an engineer at Texas Instruments in 1983, Ortberg brings a robust engineering perspective to his new role at Boeing. This is significant, as some of Boeing's staff have voiced concerns that the company's management had previously placed too much emphasis on finance rather than engineering quality. Ortberg's educational background in mechanical engineering and his long tenure at Rockwell Collins, where he rose to CEO before retiring in 2021, are expected to resonate well with the engineering community within Boeing.\n\nSteven Mollenkopf, Boeing's Chairman, praised Ortberg as an experienced leader revered within the aerospace industry for his ability to build strong teams and manage complex engineering and manufacturing operations. \"Kelly has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing into its next chapter,\" Mollenkopf remarked.\n\nEven some of Boeing's most critical observers have expressed optimism about Ortberg's appointment. Robert Clifford, an attorney representing families of 737 Max crash victims, noted that Ortberg's leadership comes at a \"crucial and necessary time for the safety of the traveling public around the world.\" He criticized the previous leadership for what he saw as negligence and expressed hope that Ortberg's tenure would bring about significant change.\n\nIn sum, Robert Kelly Ortberg steps into the role of CEO at Boeing during a period of considerable challenges and high expectations. His engineering background, combined with a proven track record in leadership, positions him as a beacon of hope for the company's future, emphasizing safety, quality, and renewed focus on solid engineering principles.\n\nOrtberg, 64, brings over 35 years of aerospace leadership to this position. He began his career in 1983 as an engineer at Texas Instruments, and then joined Rockwell Collins in 1987 as a program manager and held increasingly important leadership positions at the company prior to becoming its president and CEO in 2013.\n\nAfter five years leading Rockwell Collins, he steered the company's integration with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement from RTX in 2021. He has held a number of important leadership posts in industry, including serving on the Board of Directors of RTX. Additionally, he serves on the Board of Directors of Aptiv PLC, a global technology company and an industry leader in vehicle systems architecture. He is the former Chair of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) Board of Governors.\n\nOrtberg holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "merca20.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Merca2.0 Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_islas@merca20.com", "name": "Laura Islas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Trenchless_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Trenchless Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://files.merca20.com/uploads/2024/07/Robert-Kelly-Ortberg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 415, "textEnd": 423}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) delivered more than 30% fewer aircraft in Q2, resulting in lower revenues. Boeing announced its new chief executive, tapping an ex-Rockwell Collins, United Technologies, and RTX executive to take over the reins of the aircraft manufacturer.\n\nBoeing has continued to bleed cash, with the plane maker announcing that during the first half of the year, its free cash flow (FCF) was over -$8 billion, which includes a negative FCF of over $4 billion in Q2 2024, as it continues reeling from the quality and safety issues that it has faced throughout the year.\n\n30% fewer deliveries and corresponding losses\n\nIn Q2, Boeing delivered 92 commercial aircraft, or 32% fewer than in Q2 2023, when it handed over 136 jets to its customers. Its H1 deliveries are down 34%, dropping from 175 to 266 during the same period in 2023.\n\nAs a result, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) Q2 and H1 revenues were $6 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, while during the same two periods in 2023, BCA's earned $8.8 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively.\n\nPhoto: VDB Photos | Shutterstock\n\nOverall, BCA ended Q2 with a loss of $715 million (operating margin: -11.9%, and H1 with a loss of $1.8 billion (operating margin: -17.4%).\n\nBoeing as a company ended with revenues of $16.8 billion in Q2 and $33.4 billion in H1, with both figures being 15% and 11% lower year-on-year (YoY). As a result, the aircraft manufacturer ended the three and six-month period with a net loss of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\n\nIn total, Boeing's FCF in Q2 was -$4.3 billion, while in H1 it was -$8.2 billion, while during the same two periods in 2023, it was still positive, with the plane maker ending the first six months of 2023 with FCF of $1.7 billion.\n\nRelated Boeing Reports Q2 Jet Deliveries Amid Legal And Production Challenges\n\nNumbers were significantly down compared to 2023.\n\n15 Progress in strengthening its quality\n\nDavid Calhoun, the outgoing president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Boeing, said that while the quarter was challenging, the company has made progress in strengthening its quality management system and positioning the company for the future.\n\n\"We are executing on our comprehensive safety and quality plan and have reached an agreement to acquire Spirit AeroSystems.\"\n\nIn Q2, Boeing submitted its plan to improve the quality and safety of its commercial aircraft production to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) while also finalizing an agreement to purchase its main supplier, Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nThe company expected to close the latter transaction in mid-2025.\n\nStill, Boeing reiterated its goals to increase the production of the 737 MAX and 787, outlining that during the quarter, it gradually built more 737 MAXs.\n\nPlans to increase the monthly rate to 38 per month were still on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing also maintained its plans to build five 787s per month by the end of 2024 while reiterating that the 777X has begun its flight certification testing with the FAA after the aircraft received its type inspection authorization (TIA).\n\nRelated Boeing Initiates 777-9 Certification Flight Trials With The FAA\n\nThe beginning of certification flights follows the reception of the 777-9's Type Inspection Authorization (TIA).\n\n12 CEO successor\n\nAt the same time as it announced its Q2 results, Boeing introduced the successor to Calhoun. The company chose Kelly Ortberg to lead the company, with Ortberg assuming the duties of president and CEO of Boeing effective August 8.\n\nIn a letter to Boeing's employees, Steve Mollenkopf, the chair of the board of Boeing, stated that Ortberg was appointed after \"a thorough and extensive search process over the last several months.\"\n\nPhoto: Tada Images | Shutterstock\n\n\"Kelly brings over 35 years of aerospace leadership to this position.

He holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Iowa.\n\nCAREER\n\nOrtberg began his career as an engineer at semiconductor maker Texas Instruments before moving to aircraft electronics supplier Rockwell Collins as a program manager and holding key leadership roles at the company prior to becoming its CEO in 2013.\n\nHe steered the company's merger with United Technologies and RTX until his retirement in 2021.\n\nDuring his tenure at Rockwell Collins Ortberg also oversaw the company's development programs for Airbus A350 XWB, Boeing 787 and the Bombardier CSeries.\n\nOrtberg also serves on the board of automotive parts supplier Aptiv PLC and used to chair the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) Board of Governors.\n\nWHAT'S EXPECTED?\n\nOrtberg's focus will be on navigating Boeing through its safety and regulatory hurdles, while the US planemaker attempts to catch up with rival Airbus.\n\n\"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started,\" Ortberg said after being appointed as Boeing's CEO.\n\nApart from the Alaska Airlines fiasco, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has been docked to the ISS since June 6 after ferrying its first crew of astronauts there, having had its test mission drawn out after a series of issues involving its thrusters and leaks of helium.\n\nThe company posted a loss of $1.4 billion in the latest reported quarter and continues to burn cash.\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety.\n\nThe company is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner.

The company said Wednesday that it had also lost $1.4 billion loss in the quarter as it continues to burn cash.\n\nThe Jan. 5 incident led to the eventual resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and departure of the company's previous board president as regulators took aim at the safety culture that was already shaken by previous crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nShortly after the incident on Jan. 5, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from expanding production of its cash-cow 737 MAX family of jets without estimating how long the limitation will last.\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator capped production of 737 MAX jets at 38 per month, though Reuters has reported that Boeing has been producing jets during some weeks at a much lower level.\n\nThe regulator on Feb. 28 gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues,\" which the company submitted in May. However, the FAA's administrator has said Boeing would not be immediately allowed to increase 737 MAX production.\n\nShares rose 2.9% in premarket trading.\n\nThat has led to lower deliveries, frustrating customers. During the second quarter, Boeing delivered a total of 92 aircraft, down 32% from last year.\n\nThe company posted a loss of $2.33 a share in the second quarter, as its troubled defense and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the U.S. planemaker that has already scaled back commercial aircraft production.\n\nBoeing's Defense, Space and Security unit, one of its three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defense contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented U.S. corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.\n\n(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru;

Current CEO Dave Calhoun said he will step down by year-end after the Alaska Airlines disaster. Other contenders include Stephanie Pope, Pat Shanahan, and Steve Mollenkopf.\n\nThe race for Boeing's new chief may be down to four candidates, including a new name.\n\nKelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace company Rockwell Collins, is seriously being considered for the position of Boeing's chief, trade publication The Air Current reported on Sunday, citing industry officials.\n\nRockwell Collins provided aviation systems and information technology services to government agencies and aircraft manufacturers. It was acquired in 2018.\n\nOrtberg has 30 years of experience in the aerospace and space industry, according to his profile on RTX, the company which runs the former Rockwell Collins. He retired in 2021 as an advisor to the CEO of RTX.\n\nThere have been reports of three other contenders for the position following March announcement that CEO Dave Calhoun will step down by the end of the year, in the wake of the Alaska Airlines disaster in January.\n\nAnother candidate in the running is Stephanie Pope, the CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division. Her predecessor, Stan Deal, announced his immediate retirement at the same time as Calhoun's resignation. Pope, a third-generation employee, was formerly the plane-maker's chief operating officer and has a finance background.\n\nA third candidate is Pat Shanahan, the CEO of Spirit AeroSystems -- the supplier that built the fuselage of the Alaska 737 Max that lost its door plug midair. Earlier this month, Boeing said it would buy back Spirit, a former subsidiary, in a deal worth $4.7 billion.\n\nCurrent Boeing board chair Steve Mollenkopf is also in the running, according to Reuters. He is the former CEO of semiconductor company Qualcomm Incorporated.\n\nBoeing seems to be struggling to find a new leader. At least two people -- Larry Culp, the CEO of GE Aerospace and David Gitlin, the CEO of the home-appliances firm Carrier -- turned down Boeing's requests for the role, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nThe company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment, sent outside standard business hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nDit artikel is oorspronkelijk verschenen op z24.nl", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubhangi_goel@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Shubhangi Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Fleet_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Fleet Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/665c8928d0b8e1c832cb117a-1-scaled.jpg?ver=1722229304", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The company said Wednesday that it had also lost $1.4 billion loss in the quarter as it continues to burn cash.\n\nThe Jan. 5 incident led to the eventual resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and departure of the company's previous board president as regulators took aim at the safety culture that was already shaken by previous crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nShortly after the incident on Jan. 5, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from expanding production of its cash-cow 737 MAX family of jets without estimating how long the limitation will last.\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator capped production of 737 MAX jets at 38 per month, though Reuters has reported that Boeing has been producing jets during some weeks at a much lower level.\n\nThe regulator on Feb. 28 gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues,\" which the company submitted in May. However, the FAA's administrator has said Boeing would not be immediately allowed to increase 737 MAX production.\n\nShares rose 2.9% in premarket trading.\n\nThat has led to lower deliveries, frustrating customers.

It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nOrtberg will become CEO and president on Aug. 8, Boeing said. He emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial-airplanes division.\n\nChairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after \"a thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\n\nMollenkopf said Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The company said Wednesday that it had also lost $1.4 billion loss in the quarter as it continues to burn cash.\n\nThe Jan. 5 incident led to the eventual resignation of CEO Dave Calhoun and departure of the company's previous board president as regulators took aim at the safety culture that was already shaken by previous crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nShortly after the incident on Jan. 5, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred Boeing from expanding production of its cash-cow 737 MAX family of jets without estimating how long the limitation will last.\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator capped production of 737 MAX jets at 38 per month, though Reuters has reported that Boeing has been producing jets during some weeks at a much lower level.\n\nThe regulator on Feb. 28 gave Boeing 90 days to develop a comprehensive plan to address \"systemic quality-control issues,\" which the company submitted in May. However, the FAA's administrator has said Boeing would not be immediately allowed to increase 737 MAX production.\n\nShares rose 2.9% in premarket trading.\n\nThat has led to lower deliveries, frustrating customers. During the second quarter, Boeing delivered a total of 92 aircraft, down 32% from last year.\n\nThe company posted a loss of $2.33 a share in the second quarter, as its troubled defense and space business exacerbated the financial strain on the U.S. planemaker that has already scaled back commercial aircraft production.\n\nBoeing's Defense, Space and Security unit, one of its three main businesses, has lost billions of dollars in 2023 and 2022, which executives attributed to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts.\n\nSuch contracts have high margins but leave defense contractors vulnerable to inflationary pressures that have dented U.S. corporate earnings in the last few years.\n\nThe planemaker used to bid aggressively for fixed-price contracts before the pandemic, but has now said it would pivot away from such contracts to stem losses at the business, which amounted to $1.76 billion last year.\n\nAhead of last week's Farnborough Air Show, the unit's head had said it was \"significantly challenged\" during the quarter.\n\nBoeing CFO Brian West said in May the planemaker will burn rather than generate cash in 2024, hamstrung by lower jet deliveries compared to last year.

Pope, a third-generation employee, was formerly the plane-maker's chief operating officer and has a finance background.\n\nA third candidate is Pat Shanahan, the CEO of Spirit AeroSystems -- the supplier that built the fuselage of the Alaska 737 Max that lost its door plug midair.

Revenue fell 15% from a year earlier, and both its commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people.

Boeing is facing a host of negative headlines stemming from an incident in January when a 737 Max 9 was headed to Ontario carrying 171 passengers and six crew members. After a section of the plane blew out, it returned to Portland shortly after departure.\n\nAlthough no serious injuries were reported, the event was a huge setback for the company. Alaska Airlines temporarily grounded its fleet of 65 Boeing 737 Max 9 flights. This was reflected in Boeing's first-quarter results for fiscal 2024 when quarterly revenue fell by 8% year-over-year to $16.57 billion as the company took action to slow down the production of 737 models.\n\nBut that's not the only issue Boeing has faced, and the question is whether it can earn back trust among airlines who buy its planes and customers flying them?\n\nThe troubles have mounted for Boeing in recent year. For example, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a charge related to two crashes of 737 Max planes in 2018 and 2019, both of which were fatal.\n\nIn the Alaska Airlines case, the Department of Justice revisited the previous cases to decide whether Boeing had violated a settlement from 2021 tied to those two crashes. The plea deal allowed the company to pay an additional fine of $243.6 million with compliance monitoring.\n\nYet Boeing isn't just an airline manufacturer. There are problems in space too. After multiple delays, Boeing's Starliner spaceship finally launched in June, carrying two astronauts bound for the International Space Station (ISS). As of this writing, the spaceship's return to Earth has been delayed due to mechanical issues, leaving the astronauts stranded.\n\nIn other developments, Boeing has decided to buy back fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE:SPR) in an all-stock deal worth $4.7 billion. Spirit AeroSystems was spun out from Boeing in 2005. The deal is expected to close next year and offers hope that Boeing's supply chain can be improved.\n\nFollowing a host of embarrassments, Boeing's CEO David Calhoun has said he will step down from his post this year. The final straw that may have broken the camel's back so to speak was testifying to congress when he admitted to not being an engineer, and so assertions were cast that he was simply engaging in financial engineering at the cost of quality control.\n\nThe company has been looking for someone capable of filling that post, and it might have found its replacement in Spirit's CEO, Patrick Shanahan, although this is only speculation for now.\n\nBoeing's financials have been gyrating for a few years now. For example, in 2020, a year of disruptions for many companies, especially travel-related firms, Boeing suffered a sharp pullback.\n\nThe company's annual top line declined by 24% in 2020 compared to 2019. The next two years were periods of gradual revenue recovery and by 2023, Boeing finally rose above the pre-pandemic total revenue level for the first time, posting a revenue figure of $77.79 billion.\n\nThe airplane manufacturer has faced solid demand even during some tough macro conditions. For example, in 2020, the company reported a total backlog of $363 billion, including more than 4,000 commercial planes. These backlog figures have only grown over the years.\n\nIn spite of all the problems, Boeing commands a 40.6% market share in the airplane manufacturing industry, while Airbus has a 60.4% market share so it's in the interests of all stakeholders to keep Boeing alive.\n\nIn order to do so management will need to make a concerted effort to improve the bottom line. Looking back to 2019, the company had posted negative annual bottom-line figures every year. Net income over the past 3 years alone has accumulated to a loss of nearly $10 billion.\n\nWith that said, Boeing can survive a sharp drawdown in cash thanks to a rich balance sheet that has over $15 billion in liquid reserves. Nonetheless, shareholders won't take a whole lot of comfort knowing such a discussion is even being had for the former premier plane manufacturer.\n\nBoeing stock is unlikely to rebound anytime soon following 14 analysts downgrades in the most recent quarter.\n\nThe company is plagued by a host of issues at this time. The primary issue is the lack of trust both plane buyers and customers have in flying Boeing planes given the manufacturing defects that have grown in recent years.\n\nFinancially, the firm also suffers from weak gross margins that have not helped the bottom line. When you combine the lack of profitability over the past year with the expectations for losses once again this year, it's hard to be anything but pessimistic.\n\nIf there was one ray of sunshine, it would be the consensus forecast among 25 analysts at this time now is for the share price to climb back to $218 per share.\n\nThe low end of the range is $180 per share while the high-end forecast sits at $275 per share, which seems unlikely anytime soon until the anchor manufacturing defects has been fully addressed and consumers grow in confidence that the worst is of the problems are in the rearview mirror.", "source": {"uri": "financhill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financhill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick M.

It's unbelievable; if anybody's coming out of this deal good, it's you. Why haven't you resigned?\" Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked.\n\nCalhoun responded, \"I'm sticking this through. I am proud of having taken the job. I'm proud of our safety record, and I am proud of our Boeing people.\"\n\n\"You're proud of this safety record? Wow,\" Hawley retorted.\n\nBoeing also pleaded guilty last week to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and agreed to pay at least $243.6 million after breaching a 2021 consent decree with the Department of Justice, with the government alleging Boeing continued risky procedures in plane construction and didn't keep accurate records following the two 737 MAX crashes in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAlong the backdrop of heavy criticism and slowdown of its business, Boeing's financial performance is expected to suffer. For Q2, Boeing is expected to report revenue of $17.46 billion per Bloomberg, a 3% drop from a year ago. Profitability will likely take a steep hit, with analysts expecting an adjusted loss per share of $1.82, resulting in an adjusted net income loss of $790.74 million, a loss over 90% greater than a year ago.\n\nBoeing pulled its full-year outlook at the start of the year given the issues it was facing, most seriously at the time the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout in January. At a Wolfe Research conference in May, Boeing CFO Brian West said Boeing would burn more cash than the nearly $4 billion it did in Q1, meaning the company could report an astounding $8 billion in negative free cash flow for the first half of the year. West will be under pressure to show Boeing's cash burn will decline as 2024 progresses.\n\nNot surprisingly, Boeing's commercial deliveries took a hit in the second quarter as well. Boeing delivered 92 commercial jets in Q2, down from the 136 planes delivered year ago, or a 32% drop. The 737 Max program had 70 deliveries in Q2, down from the 103 delivered a year ago.\n\nBefore its recent issues, Boeing had monthly delivery target of 38 737 MAX jets, with a stretch goal of 50 planes per month. Investors will be looking for progress from Boeing and Calhoun that it is indeed able to expand production and deliveries despite FAA and regulator oversight. Increased deliveries will also help Boeing's aforementioned cash burn rate.\n\nBoeing also delivered nine widebody Dreamliner jets in Q2, down from 20 a year ago. The Dreamliner jet has been the subject of a few whistleblower complaints in 2024 alone, highlighting more issues with Boeing's production and assembly processes.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

His appointment takes effect on Aug. 8.\n\n\"Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,\" Steven Mollenkopf, the board chairman, said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with him as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in its long history.\"\n\nMr. Ortberg, 64, brings decades of industry experience and an outsider's perspective to the role. He is a former chief executive of Rockwell Collins, which made electronic systems and other technology for aircraft.\n\nBoeing's board had been searching for a new chief executive since March, when Dave Calhoun announced plans to step down. Mr. Calhoun, a member of Boeing's board since 2009, was appointed chief executive in 2019 to steer the company through crisis after two fatal crashes in which 346 people died.\n\nThough unrelated to the earlier crashes, the panel incident earlier this year reignited questions about the quality of Boeing's planes.

Revenue fell 15% from a year earlier, and both its commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet. It is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nOrtberg will become CEO and president on Aug. 8, Boeing said. He emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial-airplanes division.\n\nChairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after \"a thorough and extensive search process\" and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\n\nMollenkopf said Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Revenue fell 15% from a year earlier, and both its commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing. The company agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection with the Max, two of which crashed, killing 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has increased its oversight of the company following mistakes including the blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines jet. It is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety.\n\nThe company is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nShares rose more than 3% before the opening bell Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

MARCH 2019: An Ethiopian Airlines MAX crashes, killing all 157 people on board. China's aviation regulator becomes the first in the world to ground the MAX, followed by others including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. APRIL 2019: The FAA forms an international team to review the safety of the 737 MAX. Boeing cuts monthly production by nearly 20%. JULY 2019: Boeing posts its largest ever quarterly loss.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2019: Boeing's board of directors creates a permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft.\n\nOCTOBER 2019: Boeing fires Kevin McAllister, the top executive of its commercial airplanes division. DECEMBER 2020: The company fires CEO Dennis Muilenburg in the wake of the twin crashes.\n\nJANUARY 2020: Boeing suspends 737 production, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years.\n\nMAY 2020: Boeing resumes 737 MAX production at a \"low rate.\" JUNE 2020: Boeing begins a series of long-delayed flight tests of its redesigned 737 MAX with regulators at the controls. SEPTEMBER 2020: An 18-month investigation by a U.S. House of Representatives panel finds Boeing failed in its design and development of the MAX as well as its transparency with the FAA, and that the FAA failed in oversight and certification.\n\nNOVEMBER 2020: The U.S. FAA lifts the grounding order, allowing the 737 MAX to fly again. DECEMBER 2020: Congress passes legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes, including requiring manufacturers to disclose certain safety-critical information to the FAA.\n\nJANUARY 2021: The European Union Aviation Safety Agency approves the MAX's return to service in Europe. MARCH 2021: China's aviation regulator says major safety concerns with the MAX needed to be \"properly addressed\" before conducting flight tests.\n\nAPRIL 2021: Boeing halts 737 MAX deliveries after electrical problems re-ground part of the fleet.\n\nNOVEMBER 2021: Current and former Boeing company directors reach a $237.5 million settlement with shareholders to settle lawsuits over safety oversight of the 737 MAX.\n\nOCTOBER 2022: The FAA tells Boeing that some key documents submitted as part of the certification review of the 737 MAX 7 are incomplete and others need a reassessment. DECEMBER 2022: Congress agrees to extend a deadline for new standards for modern cockpit alerts stemming from the 2020 legislation after intense lobbying from Boeing.\n\nAPRIL 2023: Boeing pauses deliveries of some 737 MAXs to deal with a new supplier quality problem involving non-compliant fittings. JULY 2023: Boeing's first delivery of the 737 MAX 7 is delayed to 2024.\n\nAUGUST 2023: Boeing identifies a new 737 MAX supplier quality problem involving improperly drilled holes on the aft pressure bulkhead.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023: Boeing 737 MAX deliveries fall to their lowest levels since August 2021.\n\nDECEMBER 2023: Boeing makes its first direct delivery of a 787 Dreamliner to China since 2019, seen as a precursor to China potentially unfreezing deliveries of the 737 MAX. JANUARY 2024: A mid-air cabin blowout compels Alaska Air to perform an emergency landing of its recently acquired 737 MAX 9 aircraft, prompting the FAA to ground 171 of these jets and initiate an investigation. The FAA also bars Boeing from increasing MAX output, but lifts the grounding of MAX-9s once inspections were completed. FEBRUARY 2024: The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published its preliminary report on the Alaska Air incident involving a Boeing 737 MAX jet. According to the investigation, the door panel that flew off the jet mid-flight appeared to be missing four key bolts.\n\nMARCH 2024:\n\n** The FAA's 737 MAX production audit finds multiple instances where Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.

The deal comes as Boeing, which had sold Spirit in 2005 to cut costs, attempts to solve its quality hurdles and accelerate jet deliveries.\n\n** Boeing agrees to\n\nplead guilty\n\nto a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of $243.6 million to resolve the U.S. Justice Department investigation into the two 737 MAX fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\n** Boeing names former Rockwell Collins executive\n\nKelly Ortberg\n\nas its new president and CEO after a months-long search.\n\n(Reporting by David Gaffen, Nathan Gomes and Pratyush Thakur; Editing by Leslie Adler, Devika Syamnath,

He retired in 2021 as an advisor to the CEO of RTX.\n\nThere have been reports of three other contenders for the position following March announcement that CEO Dave Calhoun will step down by the end of the year, in the wake of the Alaska Airlines disaster in January.\n\nAnother candidate in the running is Stephanie Pope, the CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division. Her predecessor, Stan Deal, announced his immediate retirement at the same time as Calhoun's resignation. Pope, a third-generation employee, was formerly the plane-maker's chief operating officer and has a finance background.\n\nA third candidate is Pat Shanahan, the CEO of Spirit AeroSystems -- the supplier that built the fuselage of the Alaska 737 Max that lost its door plug midair. Earlier this month, Boeing said it would buy back Spirit, a former subsidiary, in a deal worth $4.7 billion.\n\nCurrent Boeing board chair Steve Mollenkopf is also in the running, according to Reuters. He is the former CEO of semiconductor company Qualcomm Incorporated.\n\nBoeing seems to be struggling to find a new leader. At least two people -- Larry Culp, the CEO of GE Aerospace and David Gitlin, the CEO of the home-appliances firm Carrier -- turned down Boeing's requests for the role, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nThe company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment, sent outside standard business hours.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubhangi_goel@businessinsider.com", "name": "Shubhangi Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockwell Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a7045eaab37011780b2881?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771357", "eventUri": "eng-9771357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security (DSS) unit has been a significant drag, posting billions in losses in 2023 and 2022. These struggles stem largely from cost overruns on fixed-price contracts, which, while potentially lucrative, have left Boeing vulnerable to inflationary pressures. In efforts to curb these losses, Boeing is now easing off on aggressive bidding for such contracts. The headwinds were acknowledged just before the Farnborough Air Show, and Boeing's Chief Financial Officer has already warned of cash burn throughout 2024 due to lower jet deliveries compared to last year.\n\nBoeing's defense business woes are part of a broader struggle affecting the company. The US aviation regulator currently limits Boeing's production of 737 MAX jets to 38 per month, but production has fallen short at times, causing customer discontent. Boeing's deliveries in the second quarter amounted to 92 aircraft, marking a 32% decline from the same period last year. These operational setbacks, coupled with financial strain, are contributing to investor unease about Boeing's capacity to recover swiftly.\n\nThe bigger picture: Navigating a challenging flight path.\n\nBoeing's issues highlight broader challenges in the aerospace sector, including the impacts of inflation and production hiccups.

Calhoun said in March that he would retire at the end of the year, and analysts generally praised the quicker transition.\n\nBoeing announced its new CEO as it reported a loss of more than $1.4 billion on falling revenue during the second quarter. The loss was wider and the company's revenue lower than Wall Street's dismal expectations, as both Boeing's commercial-airplanes business and defense unit lost money.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a tumultuous time for Boeing, which is the subject of multiple investigations into its safety culture and manufacturing quality.\n\nThe American aerospace giant agreed to plead guilty this month to a federal fraud charge in connection with its 737 Max jetliner and two crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration increased its oversight of the company and limited the number of planes it could produce after a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines Max flying at an altitude of 16,000 feet. No one was seriously hurt, but the frightening incident and subsequent scrutiny have damaged Boeing's reputation.\n\nBoeing Chairman Steven Mollenkopf said Ortberg was chosen after a \"thorough and extensive search process\"\u009d and \"has the right skills and experience to lead Boeing in its next chapter.\"\u009d Ortberg has earned a reputation for running complex engineering and manufacturing companies, Mollenkopf said.\n\nThe company waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Ortberg, a spokesperson said. Boeing did the same for Calhoun days after he turned 64 in 2021.\n\nOrtberg emerged as a leading candidate only recently. Others who were reportedly considered for the job included Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive and now CEO of its most important supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, and another longtime Boeing executive, Stephanie Pope, who recently took over the commercial airplanes division.\n\nOrtberg led Rockwell Collins from 2013 to 2018, when it merged with United Technologies and wound up as part of RTX, the company formerly known as Raytheon. He retired from RTX in 2021.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a longtime aerospace analyst and consultant and recently a harsh critic of the company, said the hire is great news for Boeing.\n\n\"He is a deeply respected leader in the aerospace industry, and brings more hope for a better future than the company has enjoyed in decades,\"\u009d Aboulafia said.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle said Ortberg \"has an engineering background, experience in the aviation industry, and experience as a public company CEO.\"\u009d\n\nIn a statement issued by Boeing, Ortberg said, \"There is much work to be done, and I'm looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nCalhoun will serve as a special adviser to the Boeing board until next March.\n\nLike Calhoun, who took over as CEO in the wake of the two Max crashes, Ortberg inherits the leadership of a company facing ongoing crises and criticism from inside and outside the company.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, is pushing back against whistleblower allegations of manufacturing shortcuts that crimp on safety. It is dealing with supply-chain problems that are hindering production, which it hopes to fix in part by re-acquiring Spirit AeroSystems, a key contractor. It faces a threatened strike this fall by its largest union, the International Association of Machinists.\n\nThe company is still trying to persuade regulators to approve two new models of the Max and a bigger version of its two-aisle 777 jetliner. And it faces a multi-billion-dollar decision on when to design a new single-aisle plane to replace the Max.\n\nThe quarterly earnings reported Wednesday reflected the continuing challenges at Boeing. The reported loss of $1.44 billion for the second quarter compared with a loss of $149 million a year earlier. Since the start of 2019, Boeing has lost more than $25 billion.\n\nExcluding special items, the second-quarter loss worked out to $2.90 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $1.90 per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue dropped 15%, to $16.87 billion, falling short of Wall Street's average forecast of $17.35 billion. The commercial airplanes division had an operating loss of $715 million, and revenue plunged 32% as Boeing delivered fewer passenger jets to airlines - 92 planes, compared with 136 a year earlier.\n\nThe FAA limited Boeing's production of Max jetliners shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident, but Boeing hasn't even hit the FAA limits as it seeks to fix its manufacturing process. The company said Wednesday that it is sticking with its plans to boost production of the Max to 38 per month by year end.\n\nBoeing took a charge of $244 million to cover a fine it agreed to pay as part of its plea deal with the Justice Department in connection with development of the Max. A federal judge in Texas will soon consider whether to approve the agreement, which also calls for the appointment of an independent compliance monitor and for Boeing to invest at least $455 million \"in its compliance, quality, and safety programs.\"\u009d\n\nMany families of the people who died in the two Max crashes, which took place off the coast of Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia less than five months later, oppose the deal and plan to ask the judge to reject it.\n\nBoeing's defense and space unit lost $913 million because of $1 billion in setbacks to four fixed-price government contracts, including a deal to build two new Air Force One presidential jets. The smaller services business earned $870 million.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Lethbridge Herald - News and Sports from around Lethbridge"},

USA!\u201d It was a rare moment of Trump coming face-to-face with open detractors, which is highly unusual for someone accustomed to staging rallies in front of ever-adoring crowds. Libertarians, who prioritize small government and individual freedoms, are often skeptical of the former president, and his invitation to address the convention has divided the party. Trump tried to make light of that by referring to the four criminal indictments against him and joking, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a Libertarian before, I sure as hell am a Libertarian now.\u201d Trump tried to praise \u201cfierce champions of freedom in this room\u201d and called President Joe Biden a \u201ctyrant\u201d and the \u201cworst president in the history of the United States,\u201d prompting some in the audience to scream back: \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d As the insults continued, Trump eventually hit back, saying \u201cyou don\u2019t want to win\u201d and suggesting that some Libertarians want to \u201ckeep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won about 3% of the national vote in 2016, but nominee Jo Jorgensen got only a bit more than 1% during 2020\u2019s close contest. Libertarians will pick their White House nominee during their convention, which wraps on Sunday. Trump\u2019s appearance also gave him a chance to court voters who might otherwise support independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. who gave his own Libertarian convention speech on Friday. Polls have shown for months that most voters do not want a 2020 rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden. That dynamic could potentially boost support for an alternative like the Libertarian nominee or Kennedy, whose candidacy has allies of Biden and Trump concerned that he could be a spoiler. Despite the raucous atmosphere, Trump continued to press on with his speech, saying he\u2019d come \u201cto extend a hand of friendship\u201d in common opposition to Biden. That prompted a chant of \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d from supporters, but more cries of \u201cEnd the Fed!\u201d \u2014 a common refrain from Libertarians who oppose the Federal Reserve. One person who held up a sign reading \u201cNo wannabe dictators!\u201d was dragged away by security. Trump tried to win over the crowd by pledging to include a Libertarian in his Cabinet, but many in the crowd hissed in disbelief. The former president did get a big cheer when he promised to commute the life sentence of the convicted founder of the drug-selling website Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, and potentially release him on time served. That was designed to energize Libertarian activists who believe government investigators overreached in building their case against Silk Road, and who generally oppose criminal drug policies more broadly. Ulbricht\u2019s case was much-discussed during the Libertarian convention, and many of the hundreds in the crowd for Trump\u2019s speech hoisted \u201cFree Ross\u201d signs and chanted the phrase as he spoke. Despite those promises, many in the crowd remained antagonistic. One of the candidates vying for the Libertarian presidential nomination, Michael Rectenwald, declared from the stage before the former president arrived that \u201cnone of us are great fans of Donald Trump.\u201d After his speech, Rectenwald and other Libertarian White House hopefuls took the stage to scoff at Trump and his speech. Those for and against Trump even clashed over seating arrangements. About two hours before the former president\u2019s arrival, Libertarian organizers asked Trump supporters in the crowd to vacate the first four rows. They wanted convention delegates \u2014 many of whom said they\u2019d traveled from around the country and bought expensive tickets to the proceedings \u2014 could sit close enough to hear the speech. Many of the original seat occupants moved, but organizers eventually brought in more seats to calm things down. The Libertarian split over Trump was reflected by Peter Goettler, president and chief executive of the libertarian Cato Institute, who suggested in a Washington Post column that the former president\u2019s appearance violated the gathering\u2019s core values and that \u201cthe political party pretending to be libertarian has transitioned to a different identity.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign noted that Biden didn\u2019t attend the Libertarian convention himself, and argued that the former president\u2019s doing so was part of an ongoing effort to reach would-be supporters in places that are not heavily Republican \u2014 including the former president\u2019s rally Thursday in the Bronxduring a pause in his New York hush money trial. The Libertarian ticket will try to draw support from disaffected Republicans as well as people on the left. Such voters could also gravitate toward Kennedy. Trump didn\u2019t dwell on Kennedy on Saturday night. But, after previously praising him and once considering him for a commission on vaccination safety, the former president has gone on the attack against Kennedy. He suggested on social media that a vote for Kennedy would be a \u201cwasted protest vote\u201d and that he would \u201ceven take Biden over Junior.\u201d The former president, while in office, referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as \u201cone of the greatest miracles in the history of modern-day medicine.\u201d He\u2019s since accused Kennedy of being a \u201cfake\u201d opponent of vaccines. In his speech at the Libertarian convention, Kennedy accused Trump and Biden of trampling on personal liberties in response to the pandemic. Trump bowed to pressure from public health officials and shut down businesses, Kennedy said, while Biden was wrong to mandate vaccines for millions of workers. For his part, Biden has promoted winning the endorsement of many high-profile members of the Kennedy family, in an attempt to marginalize their relative\u2019s candidacy. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, slammed Trump and top Republicans for opposing access to abortion and supporting limits on civil society, saying in a statement Saturday, that \u201cfreedom isn\u2019t free in Trump\u2019s Republican Party and this weekend will be just one more reminder of that.\u201d", "summary": "Trump hit back at hecklers, saying \u201cyou don't want to win\u201d and suggesting that some Libertarians want to \u201ckeep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d", "url": "https://fortune.com/2024/05/26/presidential-election-donald-trump-criminal-indictments-libertarian-party-national-convention-speech/", "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24147053998378-e1716735268212.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:05:07", "author": "The Associated Press,Will Weissert", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Will Weissert"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.121}

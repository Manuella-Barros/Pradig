Whatever a pig's life is,\" Pumba's owner said.\n\nPumba, a black 200-pound pot-bellied pig, came to be a resident of Gloucester County, New Jersey under somewhat trying circumstances. His previous owners were moving to West Virginia; they were selling their horse on Craigslist and telling potential buyers that if they couldn't find anything else to do with Pumba, they would have to euthanize him.\n\nJay, who the Inquirer is referring to by his nickname for privacy reasons, wanted to buy the horse. He didn't really want the pig, but he also didn't want to see anybody euthanized.\n\nSo about eight years ago, Jay brought Pumba home, along with the horse and a couple of chickens thrown in for good measure.\n\nJay said if he wanted to raise pigs for slaughter, he would do so, but Pumba is a pot-bellied big, and not to be eaten. Pot-bellied pigs are very smart, social, sensitive creatures, according to The Pig Placement Network. They sometimes get depressed. Pumba himself is friendly but has fearsome-looking tusks.\n\nEver since he was adopted, Pumba has lived peaceably in Jay's field, sleeping on hay, exploring the barn, and eating pig feed purchased especially for him from Tractor Supply. Nobody bothered him much.\n\n\"When I go in there to feed him, I talk to him, even though he ain't talking back,\" Jay said. \"I let him live his life out there. Whatever a pig's life is.\"\n\nJay's two-year-old grandson lives next door and they often walk between the properties. On Friday, they must not have closed the gate tightly enough, Jay said.\n\nPumba had never escaped before. But this time, he let himself out into the wide world beyond.\n\nThere he was, spotted by the Mattress Firm Sewall and the Village Pub, wandering around in traffic. The Washington Township police dispatched two officers who chased him down, tackled him, and tied him up. Then they put out a wanted poster on Facebook.\n\nCalls started coming in. Jenn Birney, a managing member of Green with Envy Landscape & Design, had just seen that pig on Jay's property the week before, when the company was doing mulch and cleanup.\n\n\"We know where the pig belongs,\" she told police.\n\nJay, who drives a tractor trailer for work and has no time for jokes, started hearing about it, too.\n\n\"My neighbor told me, 'your pig's on Facebook.' I said, 'the pig ain't on Facebook, I was just out there a half hour ago, and the pig was in the yard,'\" said Jay. Eventually he looked online. \"I saw it and said, man, that's my pig!\"\n\nThe two are now reunited. Jay is not particularly eager for the media and community attention surrounding the escape, but so be it, he said.\n\n\"I'm just a working guy. I've got a wife, kids, grandkids,\" he said. \"Hopefully the pig's got a good life.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_greenberg@inquirer.com", "name": "Zoe Greenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craigslist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gloucester County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gloucester County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor_Supply_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tractor Supply Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress_Firm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mattress Firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mulch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semi-trailer truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Township,_Morris_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/MxJ15MYDBQcgRKi3QxIMY-xO3Fw=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/LK3VEML2SVFSHCTWKAQNPZMVMU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541584", "eventUri": "eng-9541584", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

He believed it was mixed-breed.\n\nThe mother said her son could not say whether the dog attack on the pig appeared deliberate or accidental.\n\nShe said she reported the incident to the Tauranga City Council.\n\nShe said her husband had been helping the council's animal control staff try to capture the pig and almost had it a few days ago, but understandably it was a \"lot more skittish\" since the attack.\n\nShe said their concerns were for the pig's welfare and the safety of locals encountering the pig while walking through the reserve with their dogs.\n\n\"We don't know whether the pig has tusks underneath its fur or has serious injuries, but if it gets scared anything could happen,\" the mother said.\n\nThe dog-friendly 14.5ha reserve has large open spaces, bush tracks, a small waterfall and wetlands, and borders residential areas.\n\nSelwyn Ridge School is nearby but principal Craig Price said he had not heard about any sightings or encounters with the pig by school staff or students.\n\nFor safety reasons, the primary school had asked students and staff to stay out of the reserve until it was caught.\n\nCouncil animal services team leader Brent Lincoln confirmed the council received a report on April 23 that two dogs had attacked a pig in Johnson Reserve, and it was believed this pig was associated with a large group of pigs that the council rehomed from the reserve last month.\n\n\"No one has claimed the pig and we intend to capture it and rehome it.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately encounters with dogs have made the pig more wary and while we have been able to get within a couple of metres of it, we have not been able to secure it yet.\n\n\"From our observations, there are no external injuries to the pig, but I'm sure it has suffered some internal bleeding,\" he said.\n\nLincoln urged people to avoid the pig but, if possible, leave a small amount of food for it to eat and call the council.\n\n\"We are hoping that it will relax a little so that we can trap the animal and give it a new life on someone's lifestyle block.\"\n\nLincoln said every owner must ensure their dog cannot cause a nuisance or danger to any person or animal and a dog can be impounded and its owner fined up to $3000 or prosecuted for this offence under the Dog Control Act.\n\n\"In addition, an owner of a dog [who] deliberately sets their dog on to another animal such as a pig in these circumstances may also face penalties under the Animal Welfare Act.\"\n\nHe said pigs were not allowed to be kept within the city boundary unless on land zoned rural and like all stock, the area in which they were kept must be fully fenced.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandra_conchie@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Sandra

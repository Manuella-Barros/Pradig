Elaborating on the issue of appointment of Vice-Chancellors, Sukhu said that there is a communication gap. \u201cToday, I cleared this communication gap with the Governor. The file is pending on the part of the state government. It is pending with the Secretary, State Law Department. The Governor wants to appoint vice-chancellors of all four universities as soon as possible,\u201d Sukhu said. Sukhu, who met Shukla at Raj Bhavan on Friday, also termed the displeasure of the Governor over the fact that no government officer or state minister was present during the official function of International Yoga Day on June 21 as legit. The CM assured the Governor that in future these things will be kept in mind. After meeting Shukla, Sukhu said that the post of the Governor is a constitutional post. \u201cHe is right that there should be people from the government side on the day of International Yoga Day. I was myself away from Shimla on that day. Even our Shimla Mayor Surinder Chauhan was also not available on that day. I agree there should have been someone from the side of the state government,\u201d he said. Sukhu also termed his meeting with the Governor as a courtesy call. He said, \u201cIt has been almost four months, I did not meet the Governor. There has been a Model Code of Conduct in the state since March 16. We all were busy in the elections. Today, I came to meet him and cleared the communication gap. I assured the Governor that in the future all the points raised by him will be kept in mind.\u201d Though there was no response from Raj Bhavan on the meeting between CM Sukhu and Governor Shukla, sources said the two held a close door meeting for around 45 minutes. Sources said, \u201cThe move on the part of the CM suggests that the government is not in the mood to indulge in any conflict with the Raj Bhavan.\u201d However, state BJP president Rajiv Bindal slammed the state government on the issue. On Thursday, Shukla had hit at the state government stating that the state government wanted him to appoint the Vice-Chancellor of Agriculture University of their choice against the rules. He had said, \u201cThe state government wants me to appoint the person of its choice to the post of vice-chancellor. I will not go against the rules and regulations. I want to clarify that the Bill is not pending with Raj Bhavan. It was sent back to the state government seeking more clarifications. Agriculture Minister Chander Kumar should comment after verifying the facts. I am also concerned with the day-to-day functioning of CSK Agriculture University, Palampur. I know that scholars\u2019 studies are being affected in the absence of the vice-chancellor, but I can\u2019t go against the rules\u201d. In September 2023, the Assembly passed the Himachal Pradesh Universities of Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2023, enabling the government to appoint vice-chancellors to these universities. BJP legislators opposed the Bill, accusing the Government of ending the autonomy of the institutions.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-sukhu-cm-vc-university-governor-9422062/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/premium-22.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:25:12", "author": "Saurabh Parashar", "authors": ["Saurabh Parashar"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.334}

She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nHemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an

A ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court has paved the way for Sandra Hemme, a woman whose murder conviction was overturned, to be released from prison after serving 43 years. Hemme has been in custody at the Chillicothe Correctional Center.\n\nCHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri's attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 63, left prison Friday in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her daughter and granddaughter. Her sister, Joyce Ann Kays, was all grins.\n\nThe judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.\n\nHe added that further delay was causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nAfter she is released, \"she is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said after Friday's court hearing. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.",

She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nHemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.com.mt",

(AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri's attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.\n\nOn Friday, Sandra Hemme left prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release.\n\nThe judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts. Attorneys for Hemme, 64, say they are thrilled.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.\n\nHe added that further delay is causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nAfter she is released, \"she is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said after Friday's court hearing. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still behind bars late Friday, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman was opposition from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press on Thursday, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already been in prison for decades for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news",

The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, whose health is ailing.\n\nSean O'Brien, Hemme's attorney, said he's thrilled she will be released.\n\n\"This has been a long time coming. We are headed to the prison now to walk her out. She is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said. \"It's not over. There's a lot more to do but this is a big step.\"\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court have all agreed that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "trentonian.com", "dataType":

(AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years of a life sentence was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri's attorney general to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning.

O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases.

Hemme's murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison, despite objections from Missouri's attorney general.\n\nCHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years of a life sentence was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri's attorney general to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nHemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.",

She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nHemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- A Missouri judge has once again ruled that a woman whose 1980 murder conviction was overturned must be released -- and he said she must be allowed to walk free by Friday evening.\n\nJudge Ryan Horsman overturned Sandra Hemme's conviction last month and ordered her release or a retrial, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought it in the courts.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.\n\nHe added that further delay is causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nAfter she is released, \"she is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said after Friday's court hearing. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still behind bars late Friday, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman was opposition from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases.

But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.\n\nHe added that further delay was causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nAfter she is released, \"she is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said after Friday's court hearing. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType":

O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon,

O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType":

said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com",

(AP) -- A Missouri judge has once again ruled that a woman whose 1980 murder conviction was overturned must be released -- and he said she must be allowed to walk free by Friday evening.\n\nJudge Ryan Horsman overturned Sandra Hemme's conviction last month and ordered her release then, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought it in the courts.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning.\n\nHe also scolded the attorney general's office for calling the warden and telling them not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" the family said in a statement.\n\nThey continued, saying further delay is causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\n\"This has been a long time coming,\" Sean O'Brien, Hemme's attorney, said. \"She is going right to her father.\"\n\nEven though a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court have all agreed on her release, she was still behind bars late Friday, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases.

It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already been in prison for decades for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor

It's unclear if it will.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already been in prison for decades for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter. \"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"Her granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"Hemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.

The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

(AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri's attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.\n\nOn Friday, Sandra Hemme left prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence.\" But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts. Hemme is now 64 years old. Her attorney says they are thrilled.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nCHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) -- A Missouri judge has once again ruled that a woman whose 1980 murder conviction was overturned must be released -- and he said she must be allowed to walk free by Friday evening.\n\nJudge Ryan Horsman overturned Sandra Hemme's conviction last month and ordered her release or a retrial, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought it in the courts.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTwo of Hemme's relatives were in court Friday but declined to talk after the hearing. The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and moved to palliative care. \"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" Hemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, said in a court filing Thursday.\n\nHe added that further delay is causing their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nAfter she is released, \"she is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said after Friday's court hearing. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still behind bars late Friday, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman was opposition from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press on Thursday, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already been in prison for decades for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\n__\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon,

She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already been in prison for decades for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\n__\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon,

Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType":

Sandra Hemme has already served 43 years in prison. Judge Ryan Horsman overturned her conviction last month and ordered her release then, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought it in the courts. On Friday, Horsman said Hemme must be released by 6 p.m. CDT or he would bring Bailey into court next week and hold him in contempt. Hemme is now 64 years old.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court agree that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Sandra Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType":

A ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court has paved the way for Sandra Hemme, a woman whose murder conviction was overturned, to be released from prison after serving 43 years. Hemme has been in custody at the Chillicothe Correctional Center.\n\nBy HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH and JIM SALTER Associated Press\n\nCHILLICOTHE, Mo. -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri's attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 63, left prison Friday in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push Cardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words\n\nThe judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\n\"She is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said. Her father was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nHe said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years of a life sentence was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri's attorney general to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Cardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words\n\nHemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nHemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O'Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming,\" he said of her release.\n\nO'Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she\u00b4s already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn\u00b4t commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey\u00b4s office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner\u00b4s effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey\u00b4s office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn\u00b4t commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell\u00b4s effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 - just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person\u00b4s DNA on the knife, but not Williams\u00b4.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman - a fellow officer, who died in 2015 - and the prosecution wasn\u00b4t told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman\u00b4s pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke\u00b4s apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nChillicothe Correctional Center, where Sandra Hemme is being held, is pictured Thursday, July 18, 2024, in Chillicothe, Mo.

A ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court has paved the way for Sandra Hemme, a woman whose murder conviction was overturned, to be released from prison after serving 43 years. Hemme has been in custody at the Chillicothe Correctional Center.\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court agree that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Sandra Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years.

Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType":

The rest of her family members were with Hemme's father, whose health is ailing.\n\nSean O'Brien, Hemme's attorney, said he's thrilled she will be released.\n\n\"This has been a long time coming. We are headed to the prison now to walk her out. She is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said. \"It's not over. There's a lot more to do but this is a big step.\"\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court have all agreed that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison was released Friday, after Missouri's attorney general fought for more than a month to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 63, left prison Friday in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" she said. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed. \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy Cardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words\n\nThe judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme's attorneys had established \"clear and convincing evidence\" of \"actual innocence\" and overturned the conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" her attorney Sean O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released by a designated time, he wanted Bailey himself to appear in court Tuesday morning, and he threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt.\n\nHe also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after an appeals court panel said she could be released. \"I would suggest you never do that,\" Horsman said, adding: \"To call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\"\n\nThe Missouri Corrections Department then confirmed Hemme, whose been in prison for 43 years, would be released before 6 p.m. CDT Friday.\n\n\"She is going right to her father,\" O'Brien said. Her father was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \"This has been a long time coming.\"\n\nHe said previously that delays had caused their family \"irreparable harm and emotional distress.\"\n\nThere are still struggles ahead.\n\n\"She's going to need help,\" he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nOver the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nHorsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider.\n\nHemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now.\n\nHer attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agreed.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" since evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit the crime.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nSalter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, she remains behind bars. - Internewscast Journal", "body": "A circuit judge, an appellate court, and the Missouri Supreme Court all agree that a woman, whose murder conviction was overturned, should be released after spending 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Sandra Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\nThis decision has been hailed as remarkable by legal experts, such as Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor at Saint Louis University Law School. Wolff emphasized the importance of respecting and obeying court rulings once they have been made.\n\nDespite the unanimous decision from the courts, the woman, now 64 years old, faces opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. Bailey has taken legal action to extend her sentence, citing decades-old prison assault cases as justification. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has also refused to release her, citing Bailey's intervention.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com",

Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.'\n\nMr O'Brien has previously that delays had caused their family 'irreparable harm and emotional distress'.\n\nAnd there are still struggles ahead.\n\n'She's going to need help,' he said, noting she won't be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long.\n\nMs Hemme didn't address the media after her release but during the park reunion, where she hugged her family, the grandmother told her granddaughter:\n\n'You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,' she said. 'You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.'\n\nHer granddaughter laughed and replied: 'I get that a lot'.\n\nMr O'Brien said she would then be going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalised with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care.\n\nSpeaking of his client's freedom, he added: 'This has been a long time coming.'\n\nMORE : Donald Trump gunman Thomas Crooks 'had pictures of Princess Kate on his phone'\n\nMORE : JD Vance built his career by claiming to understand 'Hillbilly' Appalachia -

She still isn't. - WTOP News", "body": "A circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court agree that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned...\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court agree that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Sandra Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

daughter.\n\nJeschke's murder in November 1980 was discovered by her mother when she didn't show up for work.\n\nShe was found naked inside her apartment in a pool of blood, with her limbs bound by a

(Neil Nakahodo/The Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\n\nA Missouri woman who spent 43 years in prison after incriminating herself in a 1980 murder while she was a psychiatric patient has been freed from prison despite attempts in the last month by Missouri's attorney general to keep her behind bars.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, was the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project, after she was found guilty of killing 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke more than 40 years ago.\n\nBut a judge overturned the conviction last month, agreeing that her lawyers had established evidence of her innocence and that a former police officer was the likely killer.\n\nHemme left a prison in Chillicothe on Friday and was embraced by family and supporters at a nearby park. She hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" a smiling Hemme said to her granddaughter. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed and said, \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme declined to speak to reporters immediately after her release, which came despite Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, fighting her release in the courts. Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others.\n\nHemme received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence\", with Bailey arguing that Hemme should start serving those sentences now.\n\nDuring a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman threatened to hold the attorney general's office in contempt and said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning.\n\nThe judge also scolded Bailey's office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed on her own recognizance.\n\nHemme's attorney, Sean O'Brien, criticized the delay of her release.\n\n\"It was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\" O'Brien said. \"It shouldn't be this hard to free an innocent person.\"\n\nWhen Hemme was initially questioned about Jeschke's death, her lawyers say she was shackled in wrist restraints and so heavily sedated to the point that she \"could not hold her head up straight\" or \"articulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses.\"\n\nThe lawyers said in a petition seeking Hemme's exoneration previously that authorities ignored her \"wildly contradictory\" statements and suppressed evidence implicating then-police officer Michael Holman, who attempted to use Jeschke's card. Holman died in 2015.\n\nCONDEMNED MISSOURI INMATE IS 'ACCEPTING HIS FATE,' HIS SPIRITUAL ADVISER SAYS\n\nThe judge wrote that \"no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\"\n\n\"In contrast, this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene,\" the judge wrote.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 1980, Jeschke missed work and her concerned mother climbed through a window in her apartment and discovered her nude body on the floor in a pool of blood. Jeschke's hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord, a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat and a knife was under her head.\n\nHemme was not being investigated in connection with the killing until she showed up nearly two weeks later carrying a knife at the home of a nurse who once treated her and refused to leave.\n\nPolice located Hemme in a closet and transported her back to St. Joseph's Hospital. She had been hospitalized several times starting when she began hearing voices at the age of 12.\n\nHemme had been discharged from that same hospital the day before Jeschke's body was found, and arrived at her parents' house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement, and Hemme was subsequently questioned.\n\nHemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms when she was first questioned. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, according to her lawyers' petition.\n\nDetectives said Hemme appeared \"mentally confused\" and not fully able to understand their questions.\n\n\"Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,\" her attorneys wrote in the petition.\n\nHemme eventually purported that she witnessed a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke.\n\nWabski, whom Hemme met when they both stayed in the state hospital's detoxification unit, was initially charged with capital murder before prosecutors quickly learned he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time and dropped the charges against him.\n\nAfter learning Wabski was not the killer, Hemme cried and claimed she was the killer.\n\nPolice were also starting to look at Holman as a suspect. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting his pickup truck was stolen and collecting an insurance payout. The same truck was seen near the crime scene and Holman's alibi, in which he claimed to have spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel, could not be confirmed.\n\nHolman, who was ultimately fired and has since died, had also attempted to use Jeschke's credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was discovered. Holman claimed he found the credit card in a purse that had been left in a ditch.\n\nDuring a search of Holman's home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, which Jeschke's father said he recognized as a pair he bought for her. Police also found jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year.\n\nThe four-day investigation into Holman then ended abruptly, and Hemme's attorneys said they were never provided many of the details uncovered.\n\nHemme wrote to her parents on Christmas Day in 1980, saying she might as well change her plea to guilty.\n\n\"Even though I'm innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved,\" Hemme wrote.\n\n\"Just let it end,\" she added. \"I'm tired.\"\n\nThe following spring, Hemme agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken out of consideration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she failed to share enough details about the incident.\n\nHer attorney told her that her chance to avoid being sentenced to death relied on having the judge to accept her guilty plea. Following a recess and some coaching, she gave the judge more details.\n\nThe plea was later thrown out on appeal, but she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors were not provided details of what her current attorneys say were \"grotesquely coercive\" interrogations.\n\nThe system \"failed her at every opportunity,\" Larry Harman said in her lawyers' petition. Harman, now a judge, previously helped Hemme have her initial guilty plea thrown out.", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [],

The courts agreed that there is credible evidence of Hemme's innocence and allowed the now 64-year-old to be placed in the custody of her sister in Higginsville while her case is under review.\n\nLivingston County Circuit Judge Ryan Horsman said Hemme is a victim of \"manifest injustice.\" Hemme confessed to the crime, but evidence implicated Michael Holman, a St. Joseph police officer fired from the force.

She hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\n\"You were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\" a smiling Hemme said to her granddaughter. \"You looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\"\n\nHer granddaughter laughed and said, \"I get that a lot.\"\n\nHemme declined to speak to reporters immediately after her release, which came despite Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, fighting her release in the courts.

Holman died in 2015.\n\nThe judge wrote that \"no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\"\n\n\"In contrast, this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene,\" the judge wrote.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 1980, Jeschke missed work and her concerned mother climbed through a window in her apartment and discovered her nude body on the floor in a pool of blood. Jeschke's hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord, a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat and a knife was under her head.\n\nHemme was not being investigated in connection with the killing until she showed up nearly two weeks later carrying a knife at the home of a nurse who once treated her and refused to leave.\n\nPolice located Hemme in a closet and transported her back to St. Joseph's Hospital. She had been hospitalized several times starting when she began hearing voices at the age of 12.\n\nHemme had been discharged from that same hospital the day before Jeschke's body was found, and arrived at her parents' house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement, and Hemme was subsequently questioned.\n\nHemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms when she was first questioned. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, according to her lawyers' petition.\n\nDetectives said Hemme appeared \"mentally confused\" and not fully able to understand their questions.\n\n\"Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,\" her attorneys wrote in the petition.\n\nHemme eventually purported that she witnessed a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke.\n\nWabski, whom Hemme met when they both stayed in the state hospital's detoxification unit, was initially charged with capital murder before prosecutors quickly learned he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time and dropped the charges against him.\n\nAfter learning Wabski was not the killer, Hemme cried and claimed she was the killer.\n\nPolice were also starting to look at Holman as a suspect. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting his pickup truck was stolen and collecting an insurance payout. The same truck was seen near the crime scene and Holman's alibi, in which he claimed to have spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel, could not be confirmed.\n\nHolman, who was ultimately fired and has since died, had also attempted to use Jeschke's credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was discovered. Holman claimed he found the credit card in a purse that had been left in a ditch.\n\nDuring a search of Holman's home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, which Jeschke's father said he recognized as a pair he bought for her. Police also found jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year.\n\nThe four-day investigation into Holman then ended abruptly, and Hemme's attorneys said they were never provided many of the details uncovered.\n\nHemme wrote to her parents on Christmas Day in 1980, saying she might as well change her plea to guilty.\n\n\"Even though I'm innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved,\" Hemme wrote.\n\n\"Just let it end,\" she added. \"I'm tired.\"\n\nThe following spring, Hemme agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken out of consideration.\n\nBut the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she failed to share enough details about the incident.\n\nHer attorney told her that her chance to avoid being sentenced to death relied on having the judge to accept her guilty plea. Following a recess and some coaching, she gave the judge more details.\n\nThe plea was later thrown out on appeal, but she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors were not provided details of what her current attorneys say were \"grotesquely coercive\" interrogations.\n\nThe system \"failed her at every opportunity,\" Larry Harman said in her lawyers' petition.

Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than this confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared her, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\n\"This Court finds that the evidence shows that Ms. Hemme's statements to police are so unreliable and that the evidence pointing to Michael Holman as the perpetrator of the crime so objective and probative that no reasonable juror would find Ms. Hemme guilty,\" Horsman concluded in his 118-page ruling. \"She

But the Missouri attorney general's office filed an emergency motion to keep Ms. Hemme, who had been convicted of murder in the 1980 killing of a library worker, in prison.\n\nIn court documents filed this month, the attorney general's office said that the state's Supreme Court \"should immediately intervene\" in Ms. Hemme's case, citing two crimes she committed while in prison, including violence against an inmate and against an employee of the Missouri Department of Corrections. Ms. Hemme had been sentenced to a total of 12 years in prison because of those crimes, according to court documents.\n\nBut the Missouri Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the attorney general's emergency motion was \"moot,\" opening the way for Ms. Hemme to be freed from what her lawyers have said has been the longest-known wrongful incarceration of a woman in the United States.\n\nIt was unclear when Ms. Hemme would be released from prison.

But Prosecutor Michelle Davidson did not publicly announce a decision and did not respond to requests for comment about the case.\n\nOn July 9, Horsman issued an order for Hemme's release. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office called the warden and prevented her release, though no stay was in place.\n\nBailey's office fought Hemme's innocence case and then her release, filing motions in Livingston County and with the Western District Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court. On Thursday, the high court overruled the attorney general's motion to stay her release.\n\nDuring a heated hearing on Friday, Horsman threatened to hold officials with the attorney general's office in contempt if they further prevented her release.\n\n\"I would suggest, counsel, you never do that again,\" Horsman told Assistant Attorney General Andrew Clarke regarding their calls to the warden, adding that it was \"wrong, absolutely wrong.\"\n\nHorsman said if Hemme was not released by 6 p.m. Friday, he expected anyone with the AG's office who was involved as well as Attorney General Andrew Bailey to appear in his courtroom at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nKiller believed to be a cop\n\nOfficers interviewed Hemme several times while she was a psychiatric patient. She was convicted on statements she made to police, though many were contradictory.

Michael Holman was questioned once as a suspect, but never arrested in Jeschke's death. He died in 2015.\n\nHolman's truck was seen in the area the day of the murder, his alibi could not be corroborated and he used Jeschke's credit card after he said he found it in a purse in a ditch.

Three FBI reports on forensic evidence were also not disclosed. Information about Holman's criminal conduct in the months before and after the murder was also withheld.\n\n\"The nondisclosure of that evidence resulted in a trial that was fundamentally unfair, resulting in a verdict unworthy of confidence,\" Horsman's order said.\n\nHemme joins a growing list of people in the Kansas City region who were wrongfully convicted and freed, including Ricky Kidd, Keith Carnes, Lamonte McIntyre and Olin \"Pete\" Coones.

Email our journalists at RealityCheck@kcstar.com.\n\nAt the behest of Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's Office, the Missouri Department of Corrections continues to imprison a woman who was declared innocent and has been incarcerated for more than four decades.\n\nThat's despite an order from a judge and now a ruling from the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nOn Thursday, the high court denied a request to halt Sandra \"Sandy\" Hemme's release. Yet she has not been freed. Her attorneys have filed a motion accusing the prison warden of disregarding a lawful order by not releasing her yet.\n\nHemme's conviction in a 1980 murder was vacated June 14 by Livingston County Circuit Court Judge Ryan Horsman, who heard evidence about the case during a hearing in January.\n\nOn July 9, Horsman ordered Hemme, 64, be released from Chillicothe Correctional Center, about 90 minutes northeast of Kansas City.\n\nHowever, the Missouri Attorney General's Office intervened in her release, calling the warden though no stay was in place. The attorney general's office then filed motions with the Western District Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nThe courts struck down those efforts to block her release, including on Thursday morning when the Missouri Supreme Court rejected the attorney general's latest request.\n\nThe legal wrangling in Hemme's case has kept her behind bars, where she has spent the past 43 years. Her prison term marks the longest known wrongful conviction of a woman in U.S. history, according to information from the National Registry of Exonerations.\n\nLater Thursday, Hemme's legal team filed a motion to compel Warden Chris McBee to comply with Horsman's July 9 order, saying McBee was disregarding a lawful order by continuing to incarcerate Hemme.\n\n\"The Missouri Supreme Court firmly rejected the Attorney General's request that the court override Judge Horsman's release order,\" Hemme's legal team said in a statement. \"Ms. Hemme's family is eager and ready to be reunited with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly execute Judge Horsman's July 9th order for Ms. Hemme's release.\"\n\nHer attorneys noted that Hemme's father was hospitalized with kidney failure and as of Thursday, was receiving palliative care.\n\n\"He wants only to see his daughter free in his lifetime, just as Ms. Hemme wants nothing more than to be at her father's bedside at this time,\" the motion to compel said.\n\nMissouri Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said additional legal actions were being taken, and they couldn't release Hemme until those were resolved. A check of Missouri case records did not show that anything had yet been filed as of 5 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMurder in St. Joseph\n\nPatricia Jeschke, 31, was found dead on the floor of her St. Joseph apartment in November 1980.\n\nFormer St. Joseph police officer Michael Holman was questioned once as a suspect.

A pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings identified by Jeschke's father was also found in Holman's possession.\n\nHolman was never arrested in Jeschke's death though he was later sent to prison for stealing. He died in 2015.\n\nIn Horsman's June judgment, he wrote that \"evidence directly\" ties Holman to the murder. The judge also said a report about the earrings was never turned over to Hemme's defense attorney and three FBI reports on forensic evidence were not disclosed.

She still isn't.", "body": "By HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTH and JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nA circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court agree that a woman whose murder conviction was overturned should be free after 43 years in prison.\n\nYet Sandra Hemme is still behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled.\n\n\"I've never seen it,\" said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \"Once the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\"\n\nThe lone holdup to freedom for the 64-year-old woman is opposition from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has filed court actions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center has declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey's actions.\n\nCircuit Judge Ryan Horsman ruled on June 14 that \"the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\" A state appeals court ruled on July 8 ruled that Hemme should be set free. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly St. Louis hosts emergency and military training for massive earthquake St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time New report says MetroLink expansion in St. Louis would aid economy HOA rules in the St. Louis area can turn into fighting words Former St. Louis County health department employee pleads guilty to soliciting bribes\n\nBailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another appeal filed late Thursday asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. It's unclear if it will. Meanwhile, a judge in Chillicothe has scheduled an afternoon hearing in the case.\n\nHemme has been serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nShe's been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. Her lawyers, in an emailed statement to The Associated Press, said her family \"is eager and ready to reunite with her, and the Department of Corrections should respect and promptly\" release her.\n\nHemme's immediate freedom has been complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \"offering to commit violence.\" Bailey argues that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and the additional sentences should now be served.\n\nHer attorneys counter that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \"draconian outcome.\"\n\nSome legal experts agree.\n\nPeter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison is \"a shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\" noting that she's already served 43 years for a crime that evidence strongly suggests she didn't commit.\n\n\"To now say she has to serve an additional 12 years is like running over a person and backing your car up to run over them a second time,\" Joy said.\n\nBailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nBailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence.\n\nIn 2023, Bailey's office argued against then-St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's effort to overturn the murder conviction of Lamar Johnson, who was imprisoned 28 years. A St. Louis judge sided with Johnson, who was freed.\n\nBailey's office also argued in court in May against freeing Christopher Dunn, who has spent 33 years in prison for a 1990 killing that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore determined that Dunn probably didn't commit. A judge is still deciding that case.\n\nAnd Bailey is opposing St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell's effort to set aside the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams. A hearing is Aug. 21 -- just a month before Williams is scheduled to be executed. Testing unavailable at the time of the 1998 stabbing death found another person's DNA on the knife, but not Williams'.\n\nHorsman, after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \"malleable mental state\" when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \"often monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\" Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said.\n\nThe St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman -- a fellow officer, who died in 2015 -- and the prosecution wasn't told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found.\n\nEvidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman's pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke's apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home.\n\nHorsman, in his report, called Hemme \"the victim of a manifest injustice.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But the Missouri attorney general's office filed an emergency motion to keep Ms. Hemme, who had been convicted of murder in the 1980 killing of a library worker, in prison.\n\nIn court documents filed this month, the attorney general's office said that the state's Supreme Court \"should immediately intervene\" in Ms. Hemme's case, citing two crimes she committed while in prison, including violence against an inmate and against an employee of the Missouri Department of Corrections.

But lawyers for Ms. Hemme have argued that her statements were \"unreliable and false confessions\" because she had been given medication that was \"literally designed to overpower her will.\"\n\nOne detective who interviewed Ms. Hemme said at the time that she was \"not totally cognizant of what was going on\" and that she \"tended to wander when responding to questions,\" court documents state.\n\nThe Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization that works to overturn wrongful convictions and whose lawyers have represented Ms. Hemme, said that evidence was withheld in the case that connected a St. Joseph Police Department officer to the killing of Ms. Jeschke.\n\nThe officer, Michael Holman, was found to have used Ms. Jeschke's credit card a day after her murder, and his truck was seen near Ms. Jeschke's home around the time she was killed, according to the Innocence Project. The St. Joseph Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Mr. Holman died in 2015, according to court records.\n\nLast year, Ms. Hemme sought to challenge her conviction by filing a petition in the 43rd Circuit Court of Livingston County.\n\nThe court found in June that the statements Ms. Hemme gave to the police were \"so unreliable, and that the evidence pointing to Michael Holman as the perpetrator of the crime so objective and probative that no reasonable juror would find Ms. Hemme guilty,\" Judge Ryan W. Horsman wrote in a 118-page ruling. \"She is the victim of a manifest injustice.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Actual innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillicothe_Correctional_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chillicothe Correctional Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mootness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Holman_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Holman (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_confession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False confession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livingston County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Livingston County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Missouri-Supreme-Court-Clears-Release-of-Woman-Who-Spent-43.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744723", "eventUri": "eng-9744723", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

But Prosecutor Michelle Davidson has not publicly announced a decision and has not responded to requests for comment about the case.\n\nOn July 9, Horsman issued an order for Hemme's release. The Missouri Attorney General's Office called the warden and prevented her release, though no stay was in place.\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General's Office fought Hemme's innocence case and then her release, filing motions in Livingston County and with the Western District Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court. On Thursday, the high court overruled the AG's motion to stay her release.\n\nDuring a heated hearing on Friday, Horsman threatened to hold officials with the AG's office in contempt if they further prevented her release.\n\n\"I would suggest, counsel, you never do that again,\" Horsman told Assistant Attorney General Andrew Clarke regarding their calls to the warden, adding that it was \"wrong, absolutely wrong.\"\n\nHorsman said if Hemme was not released by 6 p.m. Friday, he expected anyone with the AG's office who was involved as well as Attorney General Andrew Bailey to appear in his courtroom at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nKiller believed to be a cop\n\nOfficers interviewed Hemme several times while she was a psychiatric patient. She was convicted on statements she made to police, though many were contradictory. No forensic evidence linked Hemme to the murder and she did not have a motive.\n\n\"Evidence directly\" ties a former St. Joseph Police Department officer to the crime, Horsman wrote in the June judgment. Michael Holman was questioned once as a suspect, but never arrested in Jeschke's death. He died in 2015.\n\nHolman's truck was seen in the area the day of the murder, his alibi could not be corroborated and he used Jeschke's credit card after he said he found it in a purse in a ditch. A pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings identified by Jeschke's father was also found in Holman's possession.\n\nHorsman said a report about the earrings was never turned over to Hemme's defense attorney. Three FBI reports on forensic evidence were also not disclosed. Information about Holman's criminal conduct in the months before and after the murder was also withheld.\n\n\"The nondisclosure of that evidence resulted in a trial that was fundamentally unfair, resulting in a verdict unworthy of confidence,\" Horsman's order said.\n\nHemme joins a growing list of people in the Kansas City region who were wrongfully convicted and freed, including Ricky Kidd, Keith Carnes, Lamonte McIntyre and Olin \"Pete\" Coones. Kevin Strickland, who was released in 2021 also spent 43 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Aside from being considered the longest-known wrongly incarcerated woman in the US, in recent weeks, her situation became more complicated.\n\nA circuit court judge in Missouri overturned her conviction on June 14, ordering her to be retried or released from prison within 30 days. The judge wrote: \"no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\"\n\nBut weeks later, the Missouri Attorney General blocked her release after a lawyer from his office intervened, calling the prison to consider whether two unrelated sentences -- amounting to 12 years in prison -- should keep her behind bars, according to a July 10 court filing.\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday sided with the lower court's ruling, signaling that Hemme now appears to be able to go free.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when she would be released. The Independent has emailed a lawyer for Hemme.\n\nThe lower court judge noted that evidence \"directly ties\" a former police officer -- Michael Holman -- to the brutal murder of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke on November 13, 1980. Holman died in 2015.\n\nJeschke's slaying was grisly. After she didn't show up for work, her mother climbed into her apartment through a window to find her daughter's naked body in a pool of blood on the floor, her limbs bound with a telephone cord, a knife under her head, and a pair of pantyhose wrapped around her throat.\n\nAs investigators began their search for the killer, Hemme reemerged in the area, having just been discharged from the psychiatric hospital -- where she had spent most of her life after age 12 -- just one day before Jeschke's body was found. Authorities found this timing suspicious.\n\nPolice took Hemme in for questioning, noting that she seemed \"mentally confused.\"\n\nAfter Hemme accused a man of being the murderer -- who could not have been since he was in an alcohol treatment center at the time of Jeschke's death -- she pleaded guilty in exchange for removing the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nAuthorities searched Holman's house after he died in 2015. They found gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, which Jeschke's father said he had given his daughter.\n\n\"She is the victim of a manifest injustice,\" the circuit judge wrote in June.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_rissman@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Kelly Rissman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Holman_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Holman (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/46fd4f38dfdca289d42dee5d6e885b47", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744723", "eventUri": "eng-9744723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 452, "textEnd": 459}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 897, "textEnd": 904}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-11-", "textStart": 1331, "textEnd": 1342}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

She was given a life sentence.\n\nThere was no evidence that linked her to the crime other than a confession she gave under heavy sedation in a psychiatric hospital, a review into her case found.\n\nNow 64, she is believed to have served the longest known wrongful conviction of a woman in US history according to her representatives.\n\nHer legal team at the Innocence Project said they are grateful that Ms Hemme is finally reunited with her family, and they will \"continue to fight\" to clear her name.\n\nWhile she is no longer incarcerated, her case is still being reviewed.\n\nCircuit Court Judge Ryan Horsman's original 118-page ruling overturning her conviction came on 14 June. It said Ms Hemme's lawyers had clear proof of her innocence, including evidence that was not given to her defence team at the time.\n\n\"This court finds that the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence,\" Judge Horsman concluded.\n\nThe review found that local police ignored evidence that directly pointed to one of their own officers - Michael Holman - who later went to prison for another crime and died in 2015.\n\nHolman's truck was seen in the area the day of the murder, his alibi could not be corroborated, and he used Patricia Jeschke's credit card after claiming he found it in a ditch.\n\nA pair of distinctive gold earrings identified by Ms Jeschke's father were also found in Holman's home.\n\nNone of this was disclosed to Ms Hemme's defence team at the time, the review said.\n\nMs Hemme was interrogated by police several times under the influence of antipsychotic medication and a powerful sedative after being involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. She had been receiving occasional psychiatric treatment since she was 12 years old.\n\nHer responses were \"monosyllabic\" and she was \"not totally cognisant of what was going on\", court documents showed, and at times could barely hold her head up straight and was in pain from muscle spasms - a side effect of the medications.\n\nJudge Horsman's review noted that no forensic evidence linked Ms Hemme to the murder. She had no motive and there were no witnesses linking her to the crime.\n\nSandra Hemme finally left prison on Friday, and the Kansas City Star reports that she will live with her sister.\n\nAfter her release she was reunited with family in a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\nHer father had been hospitalised and was receiving palliative care this week. Her legal team said she was planning to visit him as soon as she can.\n\nDefence lawyer Sean O'Brien told the Star that she will still need help because she has spent most of her life in prison and was ineligible for social security.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confession (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Holman_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Holman (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actual innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alibi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_O'Brien_(writer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean O'Brien (writer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kansas_City_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Kansas City Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antipsychotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_commitment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Involuntary commitment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/251ddc62caa968ec8d7756b94b2c6079", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744723", "eventUri": "eng-9744723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 936, "textEnd": 943}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMissouri woman Sandra Hemme has been serving time for four decades after being wrongfully accused of a 1980 murder -- now a court has cleared a path for her freedom.\n\nThe 64-year-old's dealings with the criminal justice system have been turbulent. Aside from being considered the longest-known wrongly incarcerated woman in the US, in recent weeks, her situation became more complicated.\n\nA circuit court judge in Missouri overturned her conviction on June 14, ordering her to be retried or released from prison within 30 days. The judge wrote: \"no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\"\n\nBut weeks later, the Missouri Attorney General blocked her release after a lawyer from his office intervened, calling the prison to consider whether two unrelated sentences -- amounting to 12 years in prison -- should keep her behind bars, according to a July 10 court filing.\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday sided with the lower court's ruling, signaling that Hemme now appears to be able to go free.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when she would be released. The Independent has emailed a lawyer for Hemme.\n\nThe lower court judge noted that evidence \"directly ties\" a former police officer -- Michael Holman -- to the brutal murder of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke on November 13, 1980. Holman died in 2015.\n\nJeschke's slaying was grisly. After she didn't show up for work, her mother climbed into her apartment through a window to find her daughter's naked body in a pool of blood on the floor, her limbs bound with a telephone cord, a knife under her head, and a pair of pantyhose wrapped around her throat.\n\nAs investigators began their search for the killer, Hemme reemerged in the area, having just been discharged from the psychiatric hospital -- where she had spent most of her life after age 12 -- just one day before Jeschke's body was found. Authorities found this timing suspicious.\n\nPolice took Hemme in for questioning, noting that she seemed \"mentally confused.\"\n\nAfter Hemme accused a man of being the murderer -- who could not have been since he was in an alcohol treatment center at the time of Jeschke's death -- she pleaded guilty in exchange for removing the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nAuthorities searched Holman's house after he died in 2015. They found gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, which Jeschke's father said he had given his daughter.\n\n\"She is the victim of a manifest injustice,\" the circuit judge wrote in June.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_rissman@independent.co.uk", "name": "Kelly Rissman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Holman_(filmmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Holman (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/11/15/Screenshot-2024-07-11-at-10.51.10%E2%80%AFAM.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744723", "eventUri": "eng-9744723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 587, "textEnd": 594}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1032, "textEnd": 1039}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-11-", "textStart": 1466, "textEnd": 1477}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

He was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nA review of her case found no evidence linking her to the crime, other than her confession under heavy sedation in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nNow 64, she is believed to have served the longest known wrongful conviction for a woman in American history, according to deputies.\n\nHer legal team at the Innocence Project said they were grateful Ms Hemmy had finally been reunited with her family and they would \"continue to fight\" to clear her name.\n\nAlthough he is not in jail, his case is still under review.\n\nCircuit Court Judge Ryan Horsman The original 118-page judgment It overturned his conviction on June 14. A clear proof of his innocence is the MS. Including evidence that Hemmin's lawyers had and was not given to his defense team at the time.\n\n\"This Court finds that the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence,\" Judge Horsman concluded.\n\nHolman's truck was found in the area on the day of the murder, his alibi could not be confirmed, and he used Patricia Jeschke's credit card.\n\nA pair of distinctive gold earrings identified by Ms Jeschke's father were also found at Holman's home.\n\nNone of this was reported to Ms Hemm's defense team at the time, the review said.\n\nMs. Hemme was questioned by the police several times under the influence of an antipsychotic and a powerful anesthetic after being involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. From the age of 12 he was receiving psychiatric treatment from time to time.\n\nHer responses were \"monosyllabic\" and \"she was completely unaware of what was going on,\" court documents show, adding that at times she could not hold her head straight and was in pain from muscle spasms -- a side effect of the medication.\n\nJudge Horsman's review noted that no forensic evidence linked Ms Hemm to the murder. She has no motive and no witnesses linking her to the crime.\n\nAfter being released, she reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter.\n\nHer father was hospitalized and receiving palliative care this week. Her legal team said she plans to meet with him as soon as possible.\n\nDefense attorney Sean O'Brien told the Star that he will still need help because he has spent most of his life in prison and is ineligible for Social Security.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confession (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actual innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alibi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_O'Brien_(writer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean O'Brien (writer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anesthetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antipsychotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d8e/live/e061c530-4695-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744723", "eventUri": "eng-9744723", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 865, "textEnd": 872}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

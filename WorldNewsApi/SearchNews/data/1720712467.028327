{"id": 232034988, "title": "Election 2024: MacGiolla Easbuig &#038; McClafferty elected on first count in Glenties", "text": "Independent candidates Miche\u00e1l Choilm MacGiolla Easbuig and Michael McClafferty have retained their seats on the Glenties Municipal District Council. Both were confirmed as elected just after 3pm at the count centre in the Highlands Hotel. Returning officer Paddy Doherty confirmed that both had exceeded the 1,883 quota and were, therefore, deemed elected on the first count. MacGiolla Easbuig topped the poll with 2,125 first preference votes, with McClafferty taking 1,885 votes. Celebrations were muted from MacGiolla Easbuig and his entourage, after the sudden passing of F\u00edon\u00e1n Mac Ruair\u00ed, a young man from Rannafast on Saturday, rocked his locality. Councillor MacGiolla Easbuig did not make a speech or speak to the media after he was elected, and also asked that no photos be taken of him out of respect for the deceased young man. He has been returned to the Council for the third successive time, after his first election success in 2014, and in 2019 where he also topped the polls. Meanwhile Councillor McClafferty nearly doubled his first preference votes from 2019 as he retained his seat. He was elected on the Fine Gael ticket in 2019, before quitting the party just a year later. We now await the distribution of MacGiolla Easbuig and McClafferty\u2019s surplus votes, as there will be tight competition to fill the remaining four seats in this six-seater area.

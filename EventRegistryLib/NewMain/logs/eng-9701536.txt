But he told the French Catholic daily La Croix that he had decided not to remove them now because he didn't want to \"tear the church apart.\"\n\n\"My deep, formed, intimate conviction is that they will one day need to be removed: they prevent Lourdes from reaching all the people for whom the sanctuary's message is intended,\" Micas was quoted as saying. \"But I have decided not to remove them immediately, given the passions and violence the subject incites.\"\n\nThe Rev. Marko Rupnik has been accused by over 20 women of psychological, spiritual and sexual abuses over decades. He hasn't responded to the allegations and refused to cooperate with an investigation by his former Jesuit order, but his collaborators have denounced what they called a media \"lynching.\"\n\nThe Jesuits expelled him last year after determining the women's claims were \"very highly credible.\" Some women say the abuse occurred during the creation of the artwork itself, rendering the mosaics a triggering and traumatic reminder of what they endured.\n\nThe Vatican opened a canonical investigation into Rupnik last October, after an outcry that his victims hadn't received justice and suspicions that he had been protected by Jesuits up to and including Pope Francis. The pope denied any significant involvement but confirmed Rupnik had been excommunicated for committing one of the Catholic Church's most serious crimes: using the confessional to absolve a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity.\n\nThe debate about what to do with his mosaics has simmered for two years, precisely because the works are so widespread: They grace some of the Catholic Church's most important and visited shrines, basilicas and sanctuaries around the world.\n\nThe debate exploded anew last week after the Vatican's communications chief strongly defended continuing to use Rupnik artwork on the Vatican News website.\n\nHis position prompted the pope's top anti-abuse adviser, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, to send a letter to all Vatican offices urging them to stop featuring Rupnik's artwork. O'Malley said continuing to promote it ignores the pain of victims and could imply a defense of the Slovene priest.\n\nMicas acknowledged as much in his statement and interview with La Croix, saying he understood that the mosaics have become a barrier to victims coming to pray at Lourdes because they associate them with abuse.", "source": {"uri": "ncronline.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Reporter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosaic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jesuits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Croix (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Rupnik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marko Rupnik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vatican News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se\u00e1n_Patrick_O'Malley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excommunication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confessional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovene language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basilica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope Francis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Mosaics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Mosaics", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Mosaics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Mosaics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2024-07/Vatican_Abuse_Art_24180644623129%20%282%29.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=CisWjVYh", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701536", "eventUri": "eng-9701536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

It even meets with strong opposition on the part of some: the subject stirs up passions. Today the best decision to take is not yet ripe and my conviction-turned-decision, which would not be sufficiently understood, would add even more division and violence,\" he added.\n\nThe bishop's statement comes after more than a year of discernment and prayer. Bishop Micas formed a special commission in May 2023 to determine the future of the Father Rupnik mosaics made up of victims of abuse, sacred art specialists, lawyers, safeguarding experts, and chaplains.\n\nBishop Micas told CNA in an interview at the Lourdes' shrine in February that he had received a \"pile of letters\" from Catholics all over the world regarding Rupnik's mosaics.\n\n\"We've received letters, letters, a pile of letters -- people very angry because the mosaics are still there and other people who were very angry at the idea we could remove them,\" the bishop said.\n\n\"This [decision] occupies my mind, my prayer, and my heart every day, especially when I meet victims of abuse,\" Bishop Micas added.\n\nThe Rupnik mosaics, added to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in 2008, depict the luminous mysteries of the rosary with the \"Wedding Feast at Cana\" in the center of the exterior entrance to the lower basilica. Rupnik's wide-eyed figures are set against bright gold backdrops in marked contrast with the 19th-century shrine's neo-Gothic stone facade.\n\nFather Rupnik, a priest and artist, has been accused by about two dozen women, mostly former religious sisters, of spiritual, psychological, and sexual abuse over three decades.\n\nHe was removed from the Jesuits one year ago, and the Vatican has announced that Father Rupnik will face a canonical process over the abuse allegations after Pope Francis decided to waive the statute of limitations on the claims.\n\nThe priest's prolific art career that followed his alleged abuse has created a problem for many shrines and Catholic churches across Europe and North America. Rupnik's workshop has accounted for projects for more than 200 liturgical spaces around the world, including Fatima, the Vatican, the John Paul II shrine in Washington, D.C., and the tomb of St. Padre Pio.\n\nSome have argued that removing Rupnik's art would be a manifestation of \"cancel culture\" and point to the work of Renaissance artists with scandalous personal lives. Others highlight the allegations that the accused priest convinced religious sisters to commit sins with him by persuading them that sinful acts would worship God and ask if his sacred art might likewise be imbued with and communicate \"a false Gospel.\"\n\nThe Vatican has come under criticism as it has continued to publish images of mosaics made by Rupnik on its official media outlet, Vatican News, most recently on June 28. Paolo Ruffini, the head of the Vatican's communications office, defended using Rupnik's art during an appearance in Atlanta on June 21, arguing that removing it wouldn't help his accusers.\n\nCardinal Se\u00e1n O'Malley, the Pope's top adviser on clerical sexual abuse prevention, sent a letter to the Roman Curia on June 26 asking Vatican officials not to use Rupnik's art to \"avoid sending a message that the Holy See is oblivious to the psychological distress that so many are suffering.\"\n\nFor Lourdes, the problem is felt acutely as the Marian shrine is known throughout the world as a place of healing and consolation and thought of by many as a privileged place for abuse victims seeking healing. The French bishops have underscored this by gathering in Lourdes to pray and fast for victims of abuse.\n\nIn his most recent statement, Bishop Micas underlined that he believes that at Lourdes the suffering and the wounded, including victims of sexual abuse, must always come first.\n\n\"My role is to ensure that the Sanctuary is welcoming to everyone, especially those who are suffering, including victims of sexual abuse and assault, both children and adults,\" the bishop said.\n\n\"At Lourdes, the suffering and wounded in need of consolation and reparation must always be prioritized. This is the special grace of this shrine: nothing should prevent them from responding to Our Lady's message to come here on pilgrimage.\"\n\nFor this reason, Bishop Micas said that he believes that mosaics should be removed. He added that Rupnik's art \"has nothing to do with other artworks whose artists and victims are deceased, sometimes for centuries.\"\n\n\"Here, the victims are alive and so is the artist,\" he said.\n\nEntrusting the situation to Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Bernadette, the bishop said that he will \"continue to work even more with victims and to discern what should be done here in Lourdes to honor the absolute requirement of consolation and reparation.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is the grace proper to this Sanctuary: nothing must prevent them from responding to the message of Our Lady inviting them to come on pilgrimage.\"\n\n\"Because this has become impossible for many,\" Micas said, \"my personal opinion is that it would be preferable to remove these mosaics.\"\n\nMicas also addressed the subject in an exclusive interview with La Croix International, which also appeared Tuesday, explaining that the Rupnik pieces at the Lourdes shrine are installed so as to be removable without destruction.\n\n\"[T]hey will one day need to be removed,\" he said, since they \"prevent Lourdes from reaching all the people for whom the sanctuary's message is intended,\" but he has \"decided not to remove them immediately, given the passions and violence the subject

The allegations span several decades, much of which he spent in Rome at the Centro Aletti art institute he also founded in the early 1990s.\n\nRupnik's accusers say the removal of Rupnik's art from places of worship is necessary because the abuse they suffered was part of Rupnik's \"creative\" artistic process, making the art particularly ill-suited to sacred spaces, Crux.\n\nRELATED:\n\nOther victims of sexual abuse say the presence of art bearing the signature of a notorious abuser -- especially one who escaped justice for so long as Rupnik did -- adds insult to injury and creates new trauma.\n\nOn 2 July, Bishop Jean-Marc Micas of Tarbes and Lourdes, France, issued a press release saying his \"personal preference\" is for the removal of the Rupnik mosaics currently adorning the shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, but also noted there is still resistance from some quarters on taking such action and that a consensus has not been reached.\n\nMicas announced that, for now, he is suspending the illumination of the Rupnik mosaics during evening processions at the shrine, calling this a \"first step\" and promising both to continue working toward consensus around his preference for removing the art.\n\n\"My role is to ensure that the Sanctuary welcomes everyone, and especially those who suffer, among them, victims of abuse and sexual assault, children and adults,\" Micas said.\n\n\"In Lourdes,\" Micas added, \"the tried and wounded people who need consolation and reparation must hold first place. This is the grace proper to this Sanctuary: nothing must prevent them from responding to the message of Our Lady inviting them to come on pilgrimage.\"\n\nHe added: \"Because this has become impossible for many, my personal opinion is that it would be preferable to remove these mosaics.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nMicas also addressed the subject in an exclusive interview with La Croix International, which also appeared on 2 July, explaining that the Rupnik pieces at the Lourdes shrine are installed so as to be removable without causing damage.\n\n\"[T]hey will one day need to be removed,\" he said, since they \"prevent Lourdes from reaching all the people for whom the sanctuary's message is intended\", adding, though, that he has \"decided not to remove them immediately, given the passions and violence the subject incites\".\n\n\"This option does not have widespread support,\" Micas said, and \"even meets with real opposition from some.\"\n\nHe surmised that \"were my conviction to become a decision, [it] would not be sufficiently understood, [and] would add even more division and violence\".\n\nIt has not been clarified who are the sources of opposition, nor how they could thwart the determined will of a diocesan bishop in his own see, reports Crux.\n\nMicas said he will \"continue to work even more with victims, to discern what should be done...in Lourdes, to honour the absolute requirement of consolation and reparation.\"\n\n\"We will discern,\" Micas summed up, \"with the people of good will who agree to help us, the next steps.\"\n\nPhoto: Mosaics made by artist and priest Marko Rupnik, displayed on the Notre-Dame-du-Rosaire Basilica in the Sanctuary of Lourdes, Lourdes, France, 31 March 2023.

Many of the women who accuse Rupnik of abuse are nuns from a convent in Ljubljana he co-founded in the early 1990s. Other accusations involve Rupnik's time at a Rome art institute he subsequently founded.\n\nFive of the women last month asked the dioceses where Rupnik's works are displayed to take them down - a request that the French diocese of Tarbes-Lourdes said it would honor in part. The diocese said Rupnik's mosaics within the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes - one of the world's biggest Catholic pilgrimage sites - would no longer be lit up during a procession each evening.\n\nThe Italian lawyer for the women, Laura Sgro, called the decision \"a first step that we welcome.\" But she said the mosaics will still be visible during the day and \"will continue to fuel the uneasiness of the faithful and the victims' pain.\"\n\nIn Lourdes, a think-tank including bishops, art experts, victims and psychologists had been assembled to decide whether or not the mosaics be removed. Bishop Jean-Marc Micas said he personally wanted to remove the mosaics, while cautioning that this did not have \"widespread support.\"\n\nMore than 200 of Rupnik's mosaics adorn churches around the world, from Madrid to Washington and at pilgrimage sites including Fatima in Portugal and the Vatican itself.\n\nThe Church briefly excommunicated Rupnik in 2020 after he absolved someone of having sexual relations with him, but reinstated him after he formally repented. Then in June 2023, Rupnik was expelled from the Jesuit order - of which Pope Francis is a member. In October, Francis waived the statute of limitations on the offenses, opening the way for potential disciplinary proceedings.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le

The question also raises potentially thorny problems of responsibility, canonical and civil jurisdiction, and a host of other related issues.\n\nFrom Lourdes to Connecticut\n\nBishop Jean-Marc Micas of Tarbes and Lourdes issued a press release on Tuesday announcing immediate measures to reduce the visibility of Rupnik mosaics that adorn the fa\u00e7ade of the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes. Micas said his preference is for their eventual removal, but he is working to build consensus before proceeding.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with La Croix International, Micas explained the mosaics had been installed in a manner allowing for their removal without destruction.\n\nRELATED: Rupnik art dispute more nuanced than it seems, historian says\n\n\"My deep, formed, intimate conviction is that they will one day need to be removed,\" Micas told La Croix International, \"they prevent Lourdes from reaching all the people for whom the sanctuary's message is intended.\" Nevertheless, Micas said he has decided \"not to remove them immediately, given the passions and violence the subject incites.\"\n\nThe Holy Spirit Chapel at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, and SHU's Nativity Chapel both have Rupnik-studio mosaics, as does the Holy Family Chapel at the Knights of Columbus headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nSHU and the Knights of Columbus\n\n\"We were very surprised and disappointed when we first learned of Rupnik's inappropriate and exploitive behavior,\" Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, told Crux. \"Leadership from around the University,\" SHU said, \"have had ongoing discussions about the mosaics.\"\n\n\"They are works of faith,\" SHU said, \"and we consider them as such.\"\n\nSHU did not say whether University leaders had reached a final decision regarding the mosaics' fate.\n\nThe handling of Rupnik's case by Vatican authorities and Rupnik's former Jesuit superiors has come under close scrutiny and has been the subject of intense criticism ever since the allegations against Rupnik came before the public more than a year and a half ago.\n\nThe Society of Jesus expelled Rupnik for \"disobedience\" last year, after the Vatican decided there was a case to answer but declined to prosecute, citing the statute of limitations on the crimes alleged. When the diocese of Koper in Rupnik's native Slovenia agreed to take him on as a priest in good standing, there was a global outcry.\n\nPope Francis, in the wake of the global indignation and unusual pressure from within his own inner circle, ordered a review of Rupnik's case.\n\nThat was eight months ago.\n\n\"The mosaics in our chapel were created in 2009 by many artists from [the] Centro Aletti where Marko Rupnik was the director,\" the SHU statement explains.\n\nMost of the Rupnik works that adorn Catholic places of worship around the world were produced and installed years and even decades before allegations against the priest came to light, though a few have gone up even after the gruesome allegations of serial spiritual, psychological, physical and sexual abuse began to emerge in December 2022.\n\nSeveral of Rupnik's presumed victims say his art was central to his abusive modus operandi, making his artwork especially ill-suited to the adornment of sacred space.\n\nA letter sent recently by Laura Sgr\u00f2, the attorney for five of Rupnik's most outspoken victim-accusers, to Ordinaries and rectors of shrines and chapels at which Rupnik studio art is installed, alleges Rupnik abused at least one of his victims on the scaffolding set up to install a mosaic.\n\n\"These facts occurred in a church,\" the letter says of the alleged abuse on the scaffold, \"in a consecrated place.\"\n\n\"Other sisters have recounted how they served as models for the works of Father Rupnik,\" the letter says, \"these also displayed in sacred spaces, and while they posed they were abused.\"\n\n\"This letter,\" Sgr\u00f2 wrote, \"does not constitute a judgment on the works of Father Rupnik, but only a reflection on the opportunity of their presence in consecrated placed, dedicated to Our Lord.\"\n\nThe SHU statement also said the works of Rupnik and his Centro Aletti \"can be found around the globe, including the Knights of Columbus chapel In New Haven, the Vatican and the St. John Paul II National Shrine in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nThe Knights of Columbus have their headquarters in New Haven, where there are Rupnik works in the Knights' Holy Family Chapel, as well. The Knights told Crux they have a review underway but declined to offer details.\n\n\"We have determined not to discuss the details of our review process until it concludes,\" the Knights said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Washington, DC chapter of the Knights of Columbus called for the removal of Rupnik works from the KofC-sponsored St. John Paul II Shrine in the U.S. capital.\n\nRELATED: Lourdes bishop faces resistance on removal of Rupnik art\n\n\"We are deeply disturbed by and strongly condemn all instances of sexual abuse, which are completely antithetical to the life, legacy, and teachings of St. John Paul II,\" the Knights said in regard to the St. John Paul II Shrine. \"We continue to pray for victims and are carefully considering the best course of action concerning the mosaics that were installed at the shrine.\"\n\nThe Knights also said they \"are aware of recent reports that the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith's investigation is at an advanced stage,\" calling that news \"an important factor\" in their considerations.\n\nThe Roman Question\n\nMonsignor John Kennedy, who heads the disciplinary section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith responsible for the review of the Rupnik matter, recently called Rupnik's \"a delicate case.\"\n\n\"[W]e started well, and we are really continuing step after step, keeping all aspects in mind, because there is the aspect of the allegations against him, there is the aspect of the victims, there is the aspect of the impact on the Church,\" Kennedy said, \"so it's delicate.\"\n\nThe letter from Sgr\u00f2 said the request on behalf of her clients \"must not be transmuted into a hasty judgment (It. giudizio anticipato) of the facts attributed by my clients to Father Rupnik.\"\n\n\"Regardless of any proceedings underway against the author, and in fact independent of the proceedings' outcome,\" Sgr\u00f2 wrote, \"what is asked is that reasons of good sense prevail in not using these mosaics in ecclesial settings, without respect of their artistic value, which -- it is certain -- is not under discussion here.\"\n\n\"Said works,\" Sgr\u00f2 wrote, \"cannot remain where they have been placed, both for respect of victims and for the [sacred] character of the places of prayer,\" in which they have been installed. \"This does not mean they should not find adequate space elsewhere,\" Sgr\u00f2 also wrote, \"[someplace as] does not cast a shadow over the spirituality of the faithful.\"\n\nSgr\u00f2 told Crux the letter went to \"bishops, nunciatures, religious,\" who have in their \"home\" a work of Rupnik. \"We sent the letter to all the addresses we found regarding the over two hundred twenty works by Rupnik placed in sacred places,\" Sgr\u00f2 said.\n\nIt was unclear whether either Bishop Frank Caggiano of Bridgeport or Archbishop Christopher Coyne of Hartford were in receipt of the letter.\n\nOfficials in the Diocese of Bridgeport, within which SHU is located, did not respond to Crux's repeated requests for information regarding the role of the diocese in decision-making.\n\nCoyne of Hartford, which has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over New Haven, only came into his see very recently. Coyne was in Rome to receive his pallium -- the particular sign of a metropolitan archbishop's office -- at a ceremony on Friday, the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul.", "source": {"uri":

Although he is convinced that they will have to be removed one day, the Bishop of Lourdes, Jean-Marc Micas, told the French newspaper \"La Croix\" (Tuesday evening online). Until then, the first step will be to no longer emphasise them, as was previously done, for example, by illuminating them during the evening Marian procession.\n\nMicas pointed out that it was possible to remove the mosaics without destroying them. They had not been glued directly to the walls of the basilica, but had been installed in such a way that they could be removed.\n\nHis decision was preceded by the appointment of a working group in April 2023 to discuss the continued existence of the artworks on the fa\u00e7ade of the Rosary Basilica. Micas emphasised at the time that the group was to help him with the decision he had to make as bishop.\n\nThe renowned Slovenian artist Rupnik had fallen into disrepute due to various allegations of sexual harassment and spiritual abuse. The Jesuit order and the Vatican have imposed punitive measures on him. As a result, Rupnik's religious work is also under discussion. In Lourdes, Rupnik was commissioned to create mosaics on the theme of the rosary for the fa\u00e7ade of the basilica to mark the 150th anniversary of the Marian apparitions there in 2008.\n\n\"Lourdes must be a place of consolation for those affected\"\n\nMicas emphasised that it was agreed that Lourdes must continue to be a place of consolation and healing for those affected by abuse. However, the working group was divided on the removal of the mosaics. Those in favour had emphasised that artistic or economic considerations should not be more important than the care of those affected by abuse. The opponents had pointed out that the trauma of the victims could not be healed by destroying the memories of the abuse and that the work had to be separated from the person of the artist.\n\nFor him personally, the decisive factor was that the mosaics could be an obstacle for those affected to visit Lourdes. The omnipresence of the works is problematic; they are impossible to overlook. Lourdes is a place of mercy where those wounded by life and the Church must come first, said Micas. Addressing those affected, he emphasised that their lives and their personalities were \"infinitely more valuable\" than the most beautiful work of art.\n\nThose affected call for further steps\n\nA group of affected women, represented by Italian lawyer Laura Sgro, welcomed the decision, but also called for further steps to be taken. Even if the mosaics are no longer illuminated in the evening, they are still visible during the day and fuel the disconcertment of the faithful and the feeling of pain of the victims, they said in a statement on Wednesday. Those affected are prepared to meet with Bishop Micas to discuss an appropriate course of action.\n\nRelated", "source": {"uri": "irishcatholic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Catholic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basilica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosaic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jesuits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Croix (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Rupnik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marko Rupnik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa\u00e7ade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fa\u00e7ade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrimage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary_Basilica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosary Basilica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_apparition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marian apparition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.irishcatholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/26.jpg?fit=1329%2C885&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701536", "eventUri": "eng-9701536", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Rupnik's workshop has accounted for projects for more than 200 liturgical spaces around the world, including Fatima, the Vatican, the John Paul II shrine in Washington, D.C., and the tomb of St. Padre Pio.\n\nSome have argued that removing Rupnik's art would be a manifestation of \"cancel culture\" and point to the work of Renaissance artists with scandalous personal lives. Others highlight the allegations that the accused priest convinced religious sisters to commit sins with him by persuading them that sinful acts would worship God and ask if his sacred art might likewise be imbued with and communicate \"a false Gospel.\"\n\nThe Vatican has come under criticism as it has continued to publish images of mosaics made by Rupnik on its official media outlet, Vatican News, most recently on June 28. Paolo Ruffini, the head of the Vatican's communications office, defended using Rupnik's art during an appearance in Atlanta on June 21, arguing that removing it wouldn't help his accusers.\n\nCardinal Se\u00e1n O'Malley, the pope's top adviser on clerical sexual abuse prevention, sent a letter to the Roman Curia on June 26 asking Vatican officials not to use Rupnik's art to \"avoid sending a message that the Holy See is oblivious to the psychological distress that so many are suffering.\"\n\nFor Lourdes, the problem is felt acutely as the Marian shrine is known throughout the world as a place of healing and consolation and thought of by many as a privileged place for abuse victims seeking healing. The French bishops have underscored this by gathering in Lourdes to pray and fast for victims of abuse.\n\nIn his most recent statement, Micas underlined that he believes that at Lourdes the suffering and the wounded, including victims of sexual abuse, must always come first.\n\n\"My role is to ensure that the Sanctuary is welcoming to everyone, especially those who are suffering, including victims of sexual abuse and assault, both children and adults,\" the bishop said.\n\n\"At Lourdes, the suffering and wounded in need of consolation and reparation must always be prioritized. This is the special grace of this shrine: nothing should prevent them from responding to Our Lady's message to come here on pilgrimage.\"\n\nFor this reason, Micas said that he believes that mosaics should be removed. He added that Rupnik's art \"has nothing to do with other artworks whose artists and victims are deceased, sometimes for centuries.\"\n\n\"Here, the victims are alive and so is the artist,\" he said.\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nEntrusting the situation to Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Bernadette, the bishop said that he will \"continue to work even more with victims and to discern what should be done here in Lourdes to honor the absolute requirement of consolation and reparation.\"", "source": {"uri": "catholicnewsagency.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Catholic News Agency"},

Such is decision, however, is not yet mature, and the ongoing discussion continues to provoke controversy and heated debate.\n\nThat is the substance of a statement by Bishop Jean-Marc Micas, Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes on the possibility of removing the works by the famous Slovenian mosaicist, who has been accused of sexual and psychological of adult consecrated women. After Rupnik was expelled from the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), the case against him was re-opened by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith at the behest of Pope Francis, who decided to waive the statute of limitations to allow a trial to take place.\n\n\"Many victims of sexual violence and abuse by clerics, have expressed their suffering and the violence\" they feel is done to them by seeing the mosaics at the entrance of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary, Bishop Micas said in his statement.\n\nHe explained that, together with the rector of the shrine, he had established a commission -- composed of abuse victims (from France and elsewhere), experts in sacred art, lawyers, people involved in preventing and combatting abuse, and chaplains from Lourdes -- to determine how to respond to \"this difficult problem.\" The group met from May to October of last year. At the same time, Bishop Micas said he read and listened to opinions on the matter from various other people, including Cardinals and bishops, artists, lawyers, victims, and pilgrims.\n\n\"Today, I see that opinions are very divided and often divided,\" Bishop Micas says in his statement. \"Should we leave these mosaics where they are? Should they be destroyed? Should they be removed or exposed elsewhere? There is no consensus on any of the proposals. The positions taken are lively and passionate.\"\n\nFor his part, the pastor of Tarbes and Lourdes made his \"personal opinion\": \"this situation has nothing to do with other works whose author and victims have died, sometimes for several centuries. Here the victims are alive and so is the perpetrator.\"\n\nMoreover, he said, \"I have understood over the months that it was not my responsibility to reason from the status of a work of art, about its 'morality,\" which must be distinguished from that of its author.\"\n\nBishop Micas reiterates that the shrine is meant to welcome \"everyone, especially those who suffer, including victims of abuse and violence, both children and adults.\" At Lourdes, he continues, \"the suffering and the injured who need consolation and reparation must be put first.\"\n\nSo, he says, because responding to the message of Our Lady to come on pilgrimage to Lourdes, \"has become impossible for many people, my personal opinion is that it would be preferable to remove these mosaics.\"\n\nAt the same time, he recognizes that his opinion is not widely accepted, and has even encountered \"real opposition from some.\"\n\nTherefore, the Bishop concludes, \"the best decision to be made is not yet mature, and my conviction has turned into a decision that would not be sufficiently understood and would add even more division and violence.\"\n\nNonetheless, Bishop Micas insists that he will continue to work closely with victims \"to honour the absolute need for consolation and requirement.\"\n\nFurther, the Bishop says he has decided, as a concrete step, \"that these mosaics will no longer be highlighted, as they have been until now, by the light display during the Marian procession that brings pilgrims together every evening.\"\n\n\"This is a first step,\" he says, adding, \"We will work with people of good will who are willing to help us to identify the next steps.\"", "source": {"uri": "vaticannews.va", "dataType": "news", "title": "vaticannews.va"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This perspective aims to respect and support the victims of the alleged abuses by the former Jesuit.\n\nBishop Jean-Marc Micas of the Diocese of Tarbes and Lourdes released a statement on July 2, 2024, highlighting the sensitive issue of retaining Rupnik's artwork, which is prominently displayed at the entrance of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary. The bishop underscored the pain and trauma that these mosaics evoke for the victims, citing that many have voiced their distress over the artworks' continued presence.\n\nIn the statement, Bishop Micas recounted the formation of a commission between May and October of the previous year. This commission, comprising abuse survivors (both French and international), sacred art experts, lawyers, abuse prevention advocates, and Lourdes chaplains, was tasked with addressing the complex issue. The bishop has also sought counsel from various stakeholders, including cardinals, bishops, artists, lawyers, victims, and pilgrims.\n\nThe discussions revealed a spectrum of passionate and polarized opinions. Some advocate for the mosaics to remain, while others call for their destruction or relocation. \"There is no consensus,\" noted Bishop Micas, who shared his personal opinion that the situation is unique due to the living status of both the artist and the victims, differentiating it from historical cases where the individuals involved are long deceased.\n\nEmphasizing the sanctuary's mission to provide solace to all, especially those suffering from abuse, Bishop Micas stated, \"At Lourdes, those who are suffering and need comfort and healing must come first.\" He acknowledged the opposition to the removal of the mosaics but maintained that the well-being of the victims should be prioritized. \"My personal opinion is that it would be preferable to remove these mosaics,\" he declared, although he admitted that this decision is not yet widely accepted and faces significant resistance.\n\nBishop Micas emphasized that a definitive resolution has not yet been reached, acknowledging that any premature decision could exacerbate division and violence. He committed to ongoing collaboration with abuse survivors to support their healing. Additionally, as an interim measure, the bishop decided to discontinue highlighting the mosaics during the nightly Marian procession, a step towards addressing the concerns raised.\n\nThe bishop concluded by inviting the participation of individuals of good will to help determine future actions, indicating a willingness to adapt and find a solution that respects the needs and voices of those affected by Rupnik's actions.

(Lev believes the Giotto fresco may have been the inspiration for Rupnik's work in the Redemptoris Mater.)\n\n\"Nothing unusual about it,\" Lev said of artists injecting such personal flourishes into their scenes.\n\nRELATED: Connecticut Catholic apostolates wrestle with fate of Rupnik artwork\n\nOn the other hand, Lev said there's a great deal unusual about the broader debate over the removal of Rupnik's artworks which his abuse scandals have kindled - and insists that, contrary to popular opinion, things aren't nearly as straight-forward as they may seem.\n\nCalling the distinction between art and artist \"complicated,\" Lev noted that several prominent artists whose work is featured in the Vatican and beyond have their own nefarious histories.\n\n\"Raphael was a notorious womanizer, how he seduced women is not known, but that he did is well documented,\" she said, noting that Caravaggio himself was known for his drunken antics and at one point killed a man in a violent duel.\n\nFamed French artist Eug\u00e8ne Henri Paul Gauguin was described by Lev as a \"sex tourist,\" while Gian Lorenzo Bernini, whose masterpiece canopy adorning the main altar in St. Peter's Basilica is currently being restored ahead of the upcoming Jubilee of Hope in 2025, was an adulterer, at the time a capital offense, who at one point \"slashed his mistresses face.\"\n\nLikewise, Lev said that Italian artist Carlo Crivelli served time for seducing a married woman, while Italian painter Agostino Tassi a century later was convicted for the rape of fellow artist Artemsia Gentileschi, and Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini apparently killed four men.\n\nLev voiced her belief that the core of the problem with Rupnik is that he \"seems to have had no accountability for his crimes.\"\n\n\"His crimes don't seem to have been acknowledged by the Church writ large,\" she said, lamenting the growing impression that Rupnik was protected by higher-ups and continued to be promoted even after allegations were lodged \"as if nothing had happened.\"\n\nThe appearance of Rupnik's artwork on missalettes and other Vatican materials, she said, \"makes a mockery of the entire 'closeness to victims' narrative - so as the Romans once did, instead of damning the man, at least one can damn his legacy.\"\n\nHowever, she said the situation is more nuanced than that, and flagged several considerations that as a historian she believes ought to be part of the broader debate.\n\nLev noted that Rupnik's larger projects were not completed alone, but with the help of many well-intended believing members of the Aletti Center.\n\n\"Should they be punished too? This was their time and their effort making works they thought were evangelizing - or are we saying they are all complicit?\" she said.\n\nShe also noted that, in Rome and beyond, Rupnik for decades was \"lionized\" by the Catholic community, including many of her peers, who appeared dazzled by his works and who would go to lengths to show off any mosaics they had.\n\n\"Now those people who thought he was God's gift to art want to dump him? How were they such blind patrons?\" she asked, adding, \"If we don't leave the works this question will never be asked, which I consider a problem.\"\n\nLev compared \"cancelling\" Rupnik to destroying Caravaggio masterpieces once news of the murder and of his gambling and promiscuity came to light.\n\nCenturies later, \"we can look at his struggle between light and dark and learn from it,\" she said, asking about Rupnik, \"is there nothing we can learn from thinking about why he was so popular for so many years?\"\n\nOther concerns involve the immense cost of taking down and replacing Rupnik's art, she said, noting that this also raises the question of what to replace it with, and whether whatever is found would survive as long as a Rupnik piece would have, before being taken down or replaced itself.\n\nReferring to the explicit descriptions Rupnik's alleged victims have given of his abuse, Lev lamented that \"these poor women had to do that to get anyone to pay attention,\" and voiced her belief that more attention ought to be paid to his current standing as a Catholic priest.\n\n\"Why are we more upset about his art that the fact that he is still allowed to hold a chalice?\" she said, suggesting that the church \"Start with sacraments, then let's talk about art.\"\n\nRELATED: Lourdes bishop faces resistance on removal of Rupnik art\n\nDebate over the Vatican's ongoing use of Rupnik's art has flared recently after the head of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, Italian layman Paolo Ruffini, recently sparked controversy for defending his office's continued use of the artwork of the former Jesuit on its website.\n\nDuring a June 21 session at the Catholic Media Conference in Atlanta, Ruffini was asked why his office continued to use Rupnik's artwork on its website, despite the various allegations against Rupnik, and an ongoing Vatican investigation.\n\nIn response, Ruffini said the investigation into Rupnik had not yet been completed, saying, \"who am I to judge the Rupnik stories?\"\n\nHe said that \"we're not talking about minors,\" and said that as Christians, \"we are asked not to judge.\" He also suggested that taking down the artwork would not signal any further closeness to victims and, when challenged by the audience on this, said, \"I think you're wrong.\"\n\nNata\u0161a Govekar, who leads the department for Theology and Pastoral activity in the Vatican's communications dicastery, is a member of the Aletti Center, founded by Rupnik and which for years has served as his base of artistic operations in Rome.\n\nRuffini's remarks in Atlanta were met with a wave of immediate backlash, with many observers and survivors of clerical abuse calling them insensitive and a sign that the church has learned nothing since the abuse scandals first exploded.\n\nAmerican Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston and president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors then wrote a letter to the head of all Vatican departments asking that they refrain from using Rupnik's art out of respect for victims of abuse.\n\nRELATED: Pope's safeguarding czar urges Vatican to take down Rupnik artwork\n\nIn the letter, dated June 26, O'Malley asked for \"pastoral prudence\" in displaying Rupnik's work, saying, \"We must avoid sending a message that the Holy See is oblivious to the psychological distress that so many are suffering.\"\n\nIn her comments to Crux, Lev said she believes Ruffini \"made some good points\" in his remarks, \"but they were couched in such a cavalier, dismissive attitude, that he might as well have just slapped those women in the face.\"\n\nSpeaking to journalists on the margins of a book presentation in Rome Monday, Vatican Secretary of State Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin claimed that he had not yet seen O'Malley's letter, saying, \"On the Rupnik issue, I'm not involved in it, so it's difficult for me to give an opinion.\"\n\n\"I really don't know what to say to this, because I have not yet seen this letter,\" he said, but referred to a decision announced by Bishop Jean-Marc Micas of Tarbes and Lourdes shortly before the book presentation stating that after 18 months of debating what to do with the Rupnik mosaics adorning the fa\u00e7ade of the Marian shrine there, no consensus was reached, so it was decided to leave them for now, but to no longer illuminate them at night.\n\nParolin in referring to the decision said, \"I don't think they even proposed to take down the mosaics in Lourdes, those things are a little difficult,\" but offered no further comment on the Vatican's own use and display of Rupnik's art.\n\nRupnik's case is currently being investigated by the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF), after authorities initially refused to lift a statute of limitations allowing an inquiry to take place, before reversing course at the pope's request last fall.\n\nLast summer, he was expelled from his Jesuit order, the same order to which Pope Francis belongs, after Jesuit authorities found the allegations to be \"highly credible,\" and after Rupnik refused to collaborate with an internal inquiry.", "source":

Their time and their effort [went to] making works they thought were evangelising - or are we saying they are all complicit?\" she said.\n\nShe also noted that, in Rome and beyond, Rupnik for decades was \"lionised\" by the Catholic community, including many of her peers, who appeared dazzled by his works and who would go to lengths to show off any mosaics they had.\n\n\"Now those people who thought he was God's gift to art want to dump him? How were they such blind patrons?\" she asked, adding: \"If we don't leave the works this question will never be asked, which I consider a problem.\"\n\nLev compared \"cancelling\" Rupnik to destroying Caravaggio masterpieces once news of the murder and of his gambling and promiscuity came to light.\n\nCenturies later, \"we can look at his struggle between light and dark and learn from it,\" she said, asking about Rupnik, \"is there nothing we can learn from thinking about why he was so popular for so many years?\"\n\nOther concerns involve the immense cost of taking down and replacing Rupnik's art, she said, noting that this also raises the question of what to replace it with, and whether whatever is found would survive as long as a Rupnik piece might endure.\n\nLev argues that more attention ought to be paid to Rupnik's current standing as a Catholic priest.\n\n\"Why are we more upset about his art that the fact that he is still allowed to hold a chalice?\" she said, suggesting that the Church, in deciding what to do about Rupnik, should \"start with sacraments, then let's talk about art\".\n\nDebate over the Vatican's ongoing use of Rupnik's art has flared recently after the head of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, Italian layman Paolo Ruffini, recently sparked controversy for defending his office's continued use of the artwork of the former Jesuit on its website.\n\nRELATED:\n\nRuffini's remarks were met with a wave of immediate backlash. Many observers and survivors of clerical abuse called them insensitive and a sign that the Church has learned nothing from the clerical child abuse scandal.\n\nIn her comments to Crux, Lev said she believes Ruffini \"made some good points\" in his remarks, \"but they were couched in such a cavalier, dismissive attitude, that he might as well have just slapped those women in the face\".\n\nRELATED:\n\nVatican Secretary of State Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, when speaking to journalists during a book presentation in Rome, claimed that he had not yet seen the letter by Cardinal O'Malley, adding: \"On the Rupnik issue, I'm not involved in it, so it's difficult for me to give an opinion.\"\n\nHe referred to a recent decision announced by Bishop Jean-Marc Micas of Tarbes and Lourdes that after 18 months of debating what to do with the Rupnik mosaics adorning the fa\u00e7ade of the Marian shrine there, no consensus has been reached, and so it has been decided to leave the art works in place for now, but to no longer illuminate them at night in order to reduce their visibility to a degree.\n\nRELATED:\n\nIn referring to that decision, Parolin said: \"I don't think they even proposed to take down the mosaics in Lourdes, those things are a little difficult,\" and offered no further comment on the Vatican's own use and display of Rupnik's art.\n\nRupnik's case is currently being investigated by the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF), after authorities initially refused to lift a statute of limitations allowing an inquiry to take place, before reversing course after the Pope intervened last year.\n\nPhoto: Mosaic by Father Marko Rupnik inside the Redemptoris Mater chapel in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.

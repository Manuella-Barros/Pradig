Sisak, Jennifer Peltz, Eric Tucker and Jill Colvin, Associated Press\n\nTuesday, May 28, 2024 | 8:01 a.m.\n\nNEW YORK -- Donald Trump's landmark hush money trial turns on the testimony of a prosecution witness who told lies on the stand and cannot be trusted, a defense lawyer said Tuesday during closing arguments as he pressed jurors for an acquittal in the first criminal case against a former American president.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating Trump's fate.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's landmark hush money trial turns on the testimony of a prosecution witness who told lies on the stand and cannot be trusted, a defense lawyer said Tuesday during closing arguments as he pressed jurors for an acquittal in the first criminal case against a former American president.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating Trump's fate.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,'' said defence attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.'' In an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything'' approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense team attacked the hush money case against him Tuesday by calling the star witness a liar, seeking to discredit weeks of testimony that prosecutors say prove the former president interfered in the 2016 election through a scheme to suppress stories seen as harmful to his campaign.\n\nThe closing arguments, which were expected to last the entire day, gave attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nIn an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense team attacked the hush money case against him Tuesday by calling the star witness a liar, seeking to discredit weeks of testimony that prosecutors say prove the former president interfered in the 2016 election through a scheme to suppress stories seen as harmful to his campaign.\n\nThe closing arguments, which were expected to last the entire day, gave attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nIn an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,\" Blanche said of Cohen. \"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\" and that the prosecution's star witness told \"lies\" on the stand and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys are aiming to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.

He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nIn an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nAlso Read | Papua New Guinea Landslide: India Announces Aide of USD 1 Million for Landslide-Hit Nation.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,\" Blanche said of Cohen. \"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a USD 130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels.\n\nTrump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services. Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterised that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions. \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying USD 150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump is \"innocent\" and did not break the law, a lawyer for the former president told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday as the landmark hush money trial moved closer to its conclusion.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\" and that the prosecution's star witness told \"lies\" on the stand and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Blanche said. \"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys are aiming to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you.

Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's defense team attacked the hush money case against him Tuesday by calling the star witness a liar, seeking to discredit weeks of testimony that prosecutors say prove the former president interfered in the 2016 election through a scheme to suppress stories seen as harmful to his campaign.\n\nThe closing arguments, which were expected to last the entire day, gave attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nIn an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee just months before the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nBefore prosecutors began closing arguments, Judge Juan M. Merchan urged jurors to disregard what he said was an \"improper\" comment by Blanche that the panel should not send Trump to prison. Merchan said that decision was his alone.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels.\n\nTrump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services. Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer, and to another Trump aide who said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions. \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\".\n\nIn an hours-long address to the jury, Mr Blanche attacked the foundational premises of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential election to stifle an adult film actress's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nMr Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the cheques he was signing and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than a month of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Mr Blanche said, adding that Mr Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple\".\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "bridportnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bridport and Lyme Regis News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything'' approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee just months before the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defence attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labelled Cohen the \"GLOAT'' -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nBefore prosecutors began closing arguments, Judge Juan M. Merchan urged jurors to disregard what he said was an \"improper\" comment by Blanche that the panel should not send Trump to prison. Merchan said that decision was his alone.\n\nThe case centres on a USD 130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels.\n\nTrump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services. Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterised that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\" In his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer, and to another Trump aide who said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions. \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying USD 150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nAlso Read | Michael Cohen to face more grilling as Donald Trump's hush money trial enters its final stretch\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently: --\n\nHere's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nAlso Read | Trump's defense rests case in hush money trial without calling him as witness\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election. \"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him. \"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last. Merchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday. Defense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers. Seated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\" The former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\nAlso Read | Libertarians skip over Trump and RFK Jr. for Chase Oliver\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said. He was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats. Inside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument. As has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial. They include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos. Other family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Jurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with. To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nAlso Read | Trump's attacks on early voting muddle Republican election plans\n\nAny verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life. For others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments.\n\nLast Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal. Though most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony. Following the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\".\n\nIn an hours-long address to the jury, Mr Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle an adult film actress's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the cheques he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyerss aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,\" Mr Blanche said of Mr Cohen.\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to Ms Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels.\n\nTrump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services.\n\nMr Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and evidence showing that Mr Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Mr Cohen characterised that work as \"very minimal\", Mr Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\nMr Blanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying cheques to Mr Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the evidence of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer.\n\nMr Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign cheques while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions.\n\n\"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.",

Pure and simple.\"\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe defense lawyer said he expected his argument before the seven men and five women on the jury to last about 2\u00bd hours. Then, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass gets his turn to try to persuade jurors that they should convict Trump in the first-ever trial of a U.S. president. Steinglass told New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan his arguments could last 4 to 4 1/12 hours.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Merchan is expected to read legal instructions to the jury and then hand the case to the jurors for their closed-door deliberations.\n\nUnder the U.S. legal system, the jurors will have to unanimously decide whether to acquit the 77-year-old Trump or find him guilty. If they cannot agree, resulting in a hung jury, prosecutors then would decide whether to retry the case.\n\nFor Trump, the outcome is consequential, not only for his personal freedom but his political fate. He is the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, set to run again in the November election against President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020.\n\nNational polls show Biden and Trump locked in a tight contest, but some opinion polls indicate Trump supporters could switch their vote to Biden or not vote at all if the former president is convicted.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could be placed on probation or be sentenced to up to four years in prison, although he is certain to appeal and could continue to run for the presidency.\n\nTrump is facing three other indictments, including two accusing him of illegally trying to upend his 2020 election loss. But all three cases are tied up in legal wrangling between his lawyers and prosecutors. As a result, the New York case nearing completion may be the only one decided before the November election.\n\nTrump had often said he wanted to testify in his own defense at the trial, but in the end, did not, which was his right.\n\nProsecutors called 20 witnesses to testify about an array of paperwork showing how Cohen was repaid in 2017 for the hush money he wired to Daniels' lawyers just days before the election.\n\nCohen testified that Trump told him to \"just do it\" -- to send the money to Daniels, and then later twice approved the reimbursement plan, once just before he was inaugurated as the country's 45th president and then again at a White House meeting less than three weeks after he assumed office. Trump's defense team has contended the 2017 payments to Cohen were for legal work he did for Trump, not a hush money reimbursement.\n\nTrump's team put only two witnesses on the stand. One of them, New York lawyer Robert Costello, said that in 2018, Cohen assured him he had \"nothing on Trump\" and that he, not Trump, concocted the hush money payment deal with Daniels.\n\nTrump urged several Republican lawmakers to show up in the courtroom during the trial in the seats behind the defense table as a show of support. The legislators, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, often stayed for an hour or two of testimony and then, because they were not subject to the gag order barring Trump from attacking witnesses and jurors, walked outside the courthouse and held news conferences to criticize witnesses against Trump, especially Cohen and Daniels.\n\nSome of Trump's adult children occasionally showed up at the trial, but not his wife, former first lady Melania Trump. His two oldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, were there Tuesday, as was his second daughter, Tiffany Trump.\n\nThe question for the jurors centers on Cohen's credibility, and whether the paperwork documents in the case outweigh any doubts they may have about his checkered history.\n\nHe acknowledged during hours of testimony that he has over the years been a serial liar on Trump's behalf and to protect his own wife from tax evasion charges. He said that as part of the hush money reimbursement plan, he stole $60,000 from the Trump company because he felt Trump had shorted him on his year-end 2016 bonus.\n\nCohen testified that with Trump's consent, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's then-chief financial officer, \"grossed up\" the overall reimbursement to $420,000, in part to cover Cohen's tax liability, and that the reimbursement was paid out in $35,000 monthly increments in 2017, with Trump signing nine of the 11 checks to Cohen.\n\nDespite his pivotal role in the reimbursement, Weisselberg, now serving a five-month prison sentence for lying under oath in a previous Trump-related business fraud civil case, was not called as a witness by the prosecution, which Blanche immediately noted at the start of his closing argument.\n\nEarly witnesses in the trial portrayed Cohen as brash, profane and volatile. However, on the witness stand, the 57-year-old disbarred lawyer was reserved and did not erupt under hours of a withering cross-examination by Blanche.\n\nFor years, Cohen was a Trump loyalist, his lawyer and political fixer who tended to Trump's every whim during his years as a New York real estate magnate and during his 2016 run for the presidency. As news of Daniels' claim of a liaison with Trump and the hush money reimbursement to Cohen became public in 2018, the relationship between the then-president and Cohen ruptured after federal agents raided his then-New York home, a hotel room.\n\nIn the end, Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury in connection with his lying to a congressional panel about a Trump Tower construction project in Moscow that never materialized, tax fraud and a campaign finance law violation linked to the hush money payment to Daniels. He served 13\u00bd months in a federal prison and another year-and-a-half in home confinement.\n\nSince then, he has turned into a persistent Trump critic. He testified pointedly that he hopes Trump is convicted.\n\nThe 45-year-old Daniels testified that Trump invited her to dinner in his hotel suite at a Lake Tahoe golf tourney in the western state of Nevada but never brought in any food. After talking for a while, Daniels said she unexpectedly found Trump sitting in his underwear on his bed when she emerged from a bathroom. Soon thereafter, Daniels said they had sex although she blacked out on the details of it.\n\nA month before the 2016 November election, The Washington Post unearthed a 2005 outtake from the celebrity-driven \"Access Hollywood\" show in which Trump boasted that he could grope women at will because he was a star.\n\nThe emergence of the tape led directly to the hush money payment to Daniels. The Trump campaign was worried that the Access Hollywood footage might offend female voters and that one more sex-related Trump story would be worse. Daniels, at the same time, was hawking her Trump story or wanted money to stay quiet.\n\nCohen said he created a shell company, transferred money into it from his home equity line of credit and wired Daniels' lawyer the hush money. Cohen said he would not have made the payment on his own without Trump's assent.\n\nWithin a week, Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former first lady and U.S. secretary of state, to win a four-year term in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" said defence attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defence attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a US$130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nMichael R.

None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\".\n\nIn an hours-long address to the jury, Mr Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle an adult film actress's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the cheques he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyerss aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,\" Mr Blanche said of Mr Cohen.\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to Ms Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels.\n\nTrump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services.\n\nMr Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and evidence showing that Mr Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Mr Cohen characterised that work as \"very minimal\", Mr Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\nMr Blanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying cheques to Mr Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the evidence of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer.\n\nMr Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign cheques while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions.\n\n\"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.",

He gave a thumbs-up as he left the courtroom during a break but did not address reporters.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nMore from this section France's historic D-Day beaches threatened by rising sea levels Wayne Rooney makes surprising Susan Boyle admission and reveals shock at playing golf with Donald Trump Trump defense attorney attacks hush money case as 'lies'\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to listen silently while Daniels recounted their alleged tryst and his once close personal attorney and fixer Cohen took the stand.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump has used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms",

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He raised his left hand in a fist as he left the courtroom for lunch but did not address the assembled media.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms",

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\".\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Mr Blanche said.\n\n\"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than a month of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Mr Blanche said, adding that Mr Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple\".\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)",

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L. Price in New York contributed to this report.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of former President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michael R.

He raised his left hand in a fist as he left the courtroom for lunch but did not address the assembled media.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nMore from this section\n\nUniFab All-In-One software launches latest update to comprehensively improve audio and video processing experience\n\nChurch of Scientology Debuts New Online Hub for Global Public Service Campaigns\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\n\" READ MORE: Trump's hush money trial verdict could come this week. Here's what each outcome could mean for the election.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\n\" READ MORE: Biden is struggling in Pa. -- even with his base -- as voters prefer Trump on major issues. Here are takeaways from an Inquirer/NYT/Siena poll.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@inquirer.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jill_colvin@inquirer.com", "name": "Jill Colvin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_peltz@inquirer.com", "name": "Jennifer Peltz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@inquirer.com", "name": "Michael R.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\" and that the prosecution's star witness told \"lies\" in the witness box and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Mr Blanche said.\n\n\"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, probably on Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nThe deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"},

Justice Juan Merchan said he would instruct the jury that Blanche's statement was out of line.\n\n\"That statement was outrageous, Mr. Blanche,\" he said.\n\nThe jury could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\nIn his closing argument, Blanche cast Trump, 77, as a victim of blackmail by porn star Stormy Daniels and argued that prosecutors had failed to prove he covered up a $130,000 payment to buy her silence in the final days of the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter a decade earlier.\n\nBlanche said Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story as he battled a string of unflattering stories of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"She was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage to try and get paid,\" Blanche told the 12 jurors who will decide whether to convict Trump, the U.S. president from 2017-2021, of falsifying documents to cover up the Daniels payment.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nBlanche urged jurors to look past the salacious details and focus on the paperwork at the heart of the case.\n\nHe said Trump did not know that his fixer Michael Cohen paid the hush money to Daniels, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump falsified documents when he reimbursed Cohen after the election.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decision-making.\n\nLater today, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented during the six-week trial. They must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race.\n\nOutside the courtroom, prominent Biden supporters warned that Trump would erode democracy and encourage political violence if reelected. \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now he will never leave,\" actor Robert De Niro said while pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nBLANCHE SAYS WITNESSES NOT CREDIBLE\n\nBlanche told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees.\n\nBlanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election.\n\n\"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\nThe charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means.\n\nThose \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.",

He gave a thumbs-up as he left the courtroom during a break but did not address reporters.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to listen silently while Daniels recounted their alleged tryst and his once close personal attorney and fixer Cohen took the stand.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump has used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nMore from this section\n\nBill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Blanche portrayed Trump as a blackmail victim and argued that prosecutors failed to prove wrongdoing. The case revolves around a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. Trump denies all charges.\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer urged jurors at his hush money trial on Tuesday to set aside their personal views while considering whether he should be the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\n\"This isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said while wrapping up his closing argument in the trial of the businessman-turned-politician who is the 2024 Republican candidate for president. \"If you focus just on that evidence you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very quick and easy not guilty verdict,\" he said.\n\nA short time later, after the jury was dismissed for lunch, the judge overseeing the case chastised Blanche for telling jurors that the evidence was not sufficient to send Trump to prison. Jurors are only tasked with assessing guilt or innocence, while judges determine punishment of those found guilty. Justice Juan Merchan said he would instruct the jury that Blanche's statement was out of line.\n\n\"That statement was outrageous, Mr. Blanche,\" he said. The jury could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\nIn his closing argument, Blanche cast Trump, 77, as a victim of blackmail by porn star Stormy Daniels and argued that prosecutors had failed to prove he covered up a $130,000 payment to buy her silence in the final days of the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter a decade earlier. Blanche said Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story as he battled a string of unflattering stories of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"She was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage to try and get paid,\" Blanche told the 12 jurors who will decide whether to convict Trump, the U.S. president from 2017-2021, of falsifying documents to cover up the Daniels payment. Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nBlanche urged jurors to look past the salacious details and focus on the paperwork at the heart of the case. He said Trump did not know that his fixer Michael Cohen paid the hush money to Daniels, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump falsified documents when he reimbursed Cohen after the election.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking. Later on Tuesday, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented during the six-week trial. They must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race. Outside the courtroom, prominent Biden supporters warned that Trump would erode democracy and encourage political violence if reelected. \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now he will never leave,\" actor Robert De Niro said while pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nBLANCHE SAYS WITNESSES NOT CREDIBLE Blanche told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees.\n\nBlanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election. \"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law. The charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means.\n\nThose \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes. If found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up. Trump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to listen silently while Daniels recounted their alleged tryst and his once close personal attorney and fixer Cohen took the stand.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump has used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri":

Blanche claimed prosecutors failed to prove Trump illegally falsified documents to cover up a payment to Stormy Daniels. Jurors may begin deliberations soon.\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer urged jurors on Tuesday to look past the salacious details in his criminal hush money trial and focus on the paperwork at the heart of the case as he urged them to find the former president not guilty of criminal behavior.\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said as he began his closing argument after six weeks of trial. Blanche said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump, the 2024 Republican candidate for president, illegally falsified documents to cover up a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to advance his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said as the trial resumed after a week-long break. Blanche was making his final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether Trump will become the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. Jurors could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\nOnce Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified records to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter. Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, overseeing the trial, said he would ask jurors to stay late so both sides could complete their arguments on Tuesday. \"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" he told jurors.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. They will make their closing argument after the defense, as is standard in New York criminal trials. \"Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump posted on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor would it prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race. Blanche told jurors not to rely on the testimony of Daniels or of lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nCohen testified that he paid Daniels $130,000 out of his own pocket and Trump paid him back after the election, disguising those payments as monthly legal fees. Blanche said those payments were indeed monthly legal fees as Cohen served as Trump's personal lawyer during that time.\n\n\"In life usually the simplest answer is the right one, and that's certainly the case here,\" Blanche said. During the trial, jurors heard about Cohen's felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.", "source": {"uri":

Trump's lawyer urged jurors to set aside personal views while evaluating the evidence. A conviction could lead to up to four years in prison for Trump.\n\nA New York prosecutor told jurors that Donald Trump engaged in a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 election and then tried to cover it up, as lawyers made their closing arguments in the former president's criminal hush money trial on Tuesday. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass spoke as the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president neared an end. Jurors could begin assessing Trump's guilt as soon as Wednesday.\n\nA lawyer for Trump urged jurors to set aside their personal views while considering whether to convict him of falsifying business documents to cover up a payment that ensured porn star Stormy Daniels would not tell voters during the 2016 election with her story of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. \"This isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said in his closing argument at the trial of Trump, 77, who is the 2024 Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\"If you focus just on that evidence you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very quick and easy not guilty verdict,\" he said. In his closing argument, Blanche said Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story as he battled a string of unflattering stories of sexual misconduct in the final weeks of the 2016 election. Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nSteinglass said it was irrelevant if Daniels was seeking a payday, because Trump broke the law by covering up evidence that his fixer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to keep quiet. \"It doesn't really matter because you don't get to commit election fraud or falsify business records because you think you've been victimized,\" Steinglass said.\n\nProsecutors say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking. They must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. Blanche drew a reprimand from the judge overseeing the trial for telling jurors the evidence was insufficient to send Trump to prison. Jurors are tasked with assessing guilt or innocence while judges determine punishment of those found guilty.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan told jurors after they returned from lunch to ignore that statement. \"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" he said before prosecutors began their closing argument. A conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race.\n\nBLANCHE SAYS WITNESSES NOT CREDIBLE Blanche said Trump did not know that Cohen paid the hush money to Daniels, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump falsified documents when he reimbursed Cohen after the election.\n\nHe told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees. Blanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election.\n\n\"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said. He said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\nSteinglass told jurors they were free to consider Cohen's felony convictions and history of lying when weighing his credibility, but urged them not to dismiss his testimony out of hand. \"Mr. Trump not only corrupted those around him. He also got them to lie to cover it up,\" Steinglass said.\n\nThe charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means. Those \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime. Blanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

This case is about Donald Trump and whether he should be held accountable,\" he added.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nSpeaking to reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nThe 12 anonymous jurors will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden and the verdict will inject new tension into the White House race.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nThe first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, Trump faces charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense.\n\nInstead, he used his trips to court to stage tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/dw", "source":

It's a paper case,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said as he began his closing argument after six weeks of trial.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump, the 2024 Republican candidate for president, illegally falsified documents to cover up a hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to advance his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said as the trial resumed after a week-long break.\n\nBlanche was making his final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether Trump will become the first US president to be convicted of a crime. Jurors could begin deliberations as soon as tomorrow.\n\nOnce Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified records to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, overseeing the trial, said he would ask jurors to stay late so both sides could complete their arguments today.\n\n\"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" he told jurors.\n\nProsecutors must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by US law. Trump said on social media they had an unfair advantage making their presentation after the defence, as is standard in New York.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race.\n\nBlanche told jurors they could not rely on the testimony of Daniels or of lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nCohen testified that he paid Daniels US$130,000 (RM610,194) out of his own pocket and Trump paid him back after the election, disguising those payments as monthly legal fees.\n\nBlanche said those payments were indeed monthly legal fees, as Cohen served as Trump's personal lawyer during that time.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger and emphasised that the payments were publicly reported. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\n\"If there was some deep-rooted intent to defraud, why do you think it was reported to the IRS as exactly what it was?\" Blanche said, referring to the US tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard about Cohen's felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanour under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise the Daniels payment, which they say amounted to an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up. He said Trump had done nothing improper by working with tabloid publisher David Pecker to suppress stories that might have hurt his campaign.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if there was a conspiracy to try to win an election,\" he said. \"You have to find that this effort was done by unlawful means.\"\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid. -- Reuters",

Sisak | Associated Press, Jennifer Peltz | Associated Press, Eric Tucker | The Associated Press and Michelle Price | mprice@ap.org | Associated Press\n\nBy MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump is \"innocent\" and did not break the law, a lawyer for the former president told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday as the landmark hush money trial moved closer to its conclusion.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, probably on Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nThe deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump at Manhattan Criminal Court (Spencer Platt/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump at Manhattan Criminal Court before closing arguments in his criminal hush money trial (Spencer Platt/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nMichael Cohen (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nDonald Trump speaks to members of the media upon arriving at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York (Julia Nikhinson, Pool/AP)\n\nThe three

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He raised his left hand in a fist as he left the courtroom for lunch but did not address the assembled media.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nFOX41

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\" and that the prosecution's star witness told \"lies\" in the witness box and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks\" are simple, Mr Blanche said.\n\n\"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, probably on Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nThe deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases centre on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "thenorthernecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Northern

He lied to you,\" Blanche told the jury. \"He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true. ... Michael Cohen is the GLOAT, greatest liar of all times.\"\n\nAnd in a highly charged statement that later earned the stern rebuke of the presiding judge, Blanche told the jury: \"You cannot, you cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict someone based on the words of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDefense attorneys are prohibited from arguing against convicting their clients based on a penalty they could receive if found guilty, as jurors in New York State have no role in sentencing criminal defendants. Judges are tasked with imposing sentences.\n\nAfter Blanche concluded his summation and the jury was dismissed for lunch, Manhattan prosecutor Joshua Steinglass accused Blanche of misconduct, calling his conduct \"a blatant and wholly unlawful attempt to curry sympathy for their client.\"\n\nSupreme Court Justice Juan Merchan agreed with the prosecution's request for the judge to make a curative instruction to the jury, telling the body to disregard Blanche's statement and pointing out that a prison sentence is not mandatory for the charges. Trump faces up to four years in prison if convicted, but could receive no jail time as a first-time offender in a white-collar case.\n\n\"I think saying that is outrageous,\" said Merchan. \"Someone who has been a prosecutor as long as you is simply outrageous. I can't believe that was inadvertent. It's simply not allowed.\"\n\nEarlier in his summation, Blanche emphasized the charges against Trump are based on documents -- not a sexual liaison or the inner workings of the tabloid industry -- which he argued shows that Trump, then the leader of the free world, had no involvement in the company's record-keeping.\n\n\"This case is about documents; it's a paper case,\" said Blanche. \"This is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago -- an account that President Trump has denied.\"\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of felony falsifying business records as part of what prosecutors alleged was a scheme to cover-up the payment of hush money to adult film actress Daniels, who testified -- in sometimes graphic detail -- that she had a sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2016, during which Trump did not wear protection.\n\nProsecutors have said the cover-up was part of a pattern of ''catch and kill\" schemes, the heart of a \"criminal conspiracy\" between Trump, Cohen and supermarket tabloid publisher David Pecker, to buy negative stories about Trump and bury them as he sought the presidency against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe charges of falsifying business records are misdemeanors, but were upgraded to felonies by prosecutors, who argued the crimes were committed in order to cover up another crime, which prosecutors said is conspiracy to promote an election by unlawful means.\n\nProsecutors have said the payment was illegally recorded in Trump Organization records as legal services as part of a retainer agreement, but neither the retainer nor the legal services existed.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has kept a relatively low profile during Trump's trial, was in court as Blanche delivered his closing. Three of Trump's children were also in attendance -- Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump. Trump's wife, Melania Trump -- who had only months before given birth to Trump's youngest son, Barron, now 18, at the time that Daniels alleged she bedded Trump -- was not.\n\nBlanche, in his summation, seized on the testimony of Trump employees to disprove that Trump directed the falsification of the records -- vouchers, invoices and checks -- with the intent to defraud, which jurors have to find in order to convict Trump.\n\n\"Is the personal ledger accurate? Were those bookings entered with the intent to defraud?\" Blanche asked the jury. \"Our conclusion is absolutely not.\"\n\nBlanche, who displayed some of the documents in question for the jury as he spoke, reminded the jury of testimony from one Trump employee who said that the vouchers were \"auto-generated from the information in the invoices.\" The word \"retainer\" was \"generated by the software,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"The records were not false and the intent was not to defraud,\" said Blanche.\n\nTrump's payments to Cohen -- $35,000 monthly -- were not repayment for the hush money, Blanche argued, but were simply what the documents stated -- legal services. Cohen was still acting as Trump's personal attorney at the time, Blanche argued, and it's preposterous to believe that Cohen would have worked for free, despite Cohen's testimony that he was making money from various entities at the time by trading on his connection to Trump, then the newly minted president.\n\n\"The prosecution will say that you know that President Trump saw all of these invoices because she testified that she stapled the invoices to the checks\" when she sent them to Washington, D.C.,\" Blanche told the jury. \"She told you about her general practice, but general practice is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. She never spoke to President Trump. She just did what she always does. She got an invoice from a lawyer and entered it in as a legal expense.\"\n\nBlanche added: \"It was consistent with what she understood was happening at that time, which is that Michael Cohen was acting as President Trump's personal attorney. That is not in dispute.\"\n\nTrump was in the White House during this period and far removed from the running of his company, Blanche argued.\n\n\"President Trump was busy running the country,\" said Blanche.\"[White House aide] Ms. Westerhout testified that sometimes President Trump looked at the checks, sometimes he didn't. ... You can't convict President Trump because sometimes without anything specific at all to the charges in this case that he sometimes looked at invoices. That is a stretch. That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt.\"\n\nCohen, himself, testified that he let the world know that he was working as Trump's lawyer.\n\n\"He put that signature block on every email he sent in 2017 -- Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" said Blanche.\n\nBlanche asked the jury to think about what made more sense -- that Trump, as the prosecution alleges, reimbursed Cohen triple the $130,000 paid to Daniels, although Trump was described as penny-pinching by multiple witnesses? Or that the $420,000 that Trump paid Cohen, at a rate of $35,000 monthly, was Cohen's payment for working as Trump's personal attorney?\n\n\"There's a reason why in life, the simplest answer is the right one and the story that Michael Cohen told you on the witness stand is not true,\" said Blanche. \"The idea that President Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000 even though he only owed him $130,000 is absurd.\"\n\nBlanche added: \"You cannot convict President Trump beyond a reasonable doubt based on the testimony of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nBlanche pointed out that Trump repeatedly disclosed the payments to Cohen to various entities, including the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\"How is there an intent to defraud if he discloses it to the IRS, he tweets about it and he puts it on his financial disclosure form?\" Blanche asked.\n\nBlanche also asked the jury to question why the prosecution declined to call some potential witnesses to the stand, including former Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg, ex-National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard, and former Trump bodyguard and White House aide Keith Schiller and the two eldest Trump sons.\n\nThe notion that Trump, Cohen and Pecker cooked up a conspiracy to impact the presidential election during an Aug. 15, 2015 meeting at Trump Tower to \"catch and kill\" negative stories about Trump doesn't align with trial testimony, that included Pecker testifying that the National Enquirer's parent company -- American Media Inc. -- had long been in the practice of buying and burying stories for celebrities.\n\n\"This is the same thing that AMI had been doing for decades,\" said Blanche. \"They had been doing it for President Trump since the 90s. They purchase stories all the time. They did it with Mark Wahlberg, Tiger Woods. ... Many politicians work with the media to try to promote their image. It's how you try to win elections.\"\n\nEchoing what he emphasized in his opening statement -- that impacting an election is part of the democratic process -- Blanche said: This is a campaign. This is not a crime. Nothing criminal about it. It's done all the time.\"\n\nBlanche accused Cohen of lying about several parts of his testimony, and questioned a voice recording that Cohen made of Trump, in which they allegedly discussed a hush money payment to another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said to have had an affair with Trump.\n\nBlanche cautioned jurors that they have \"no idea about the integrity of this file\" in which Trump is heard saying to pay \"cash.\"\n\n\"There's no way that you can believe that President Trump knew about this payment without believing the words of Michael Cohen,\" said Blanche. \"And you cannot, you cannot believe the words of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nBlanche, returning to a point he attempted to make during his cross-examination of Cohen, told the jury that Cohen perjured himself when he testified that he discussed the hush money payment agreement on a 90-second phone call with Trump on Oct. 24, 2016, which was patched through by Schiller, then Trump's bodyguard.\n\n\"It was a lie and he got caught red-handed,\" said Blanche. \"We all know that he called Mr. Schiller about a 14-year-old prank caller who had bothered him for a number of days.\"\n\nWith emphasis on each syllable, Blanche said: \"That is perjury.\"\n\nBlanche continued to attack Cohen, who testified that he was convicted previously of lying to Congress.\n\n\"He's repeatedly lied under oath,\" said Blanche. \"He's lied to his family. He lied to his banker, he lied, if you believe what he says on the stand, he lied to the feds, he lied to every reporter he spoke to before the election. He's like the MVP of liars. He's also a thief. He stole tens of thousands of dollars on the way out the door of the Trump Organization. He lied to you.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nRelated Story: Clovis Detectives Quickly Arrest Suspects in Construction Equipment Theft at ...\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nRelated Story: The Latest | Defense Targets Michael Cohen's Testimony in Closing ...\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nRelated Story: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Challenges Donald Trump to Debate at Libertarian ...\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside the courtroom, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Cohen took the stand.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump has used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nMore from this section\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Jurors are tasked with assessing guilt or innocence while judges determine punishment of those found guilty. Justice Juan Merchan told jurors after they returned from lunch to ignore that statement. \"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" he said before prosecutors began their closing argument.\n\nThe jury could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday. In his closing argument, Blanche cast Trump, 77, as a victim of blackmail by porn star Stormy Daniels and argued that prosecutors had failed to prove he covered up a $130,000 payment to buy her silence in the final days of the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter a decade earlier.\n\nBlanche said Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story as he battled a string of unflattering stories of sexual misconduct. \"She was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage to try and get paid,\" Blanche told the 12 jurors who will decide whether to convict Trump, the U.S. president from 2017-2021, of falsifying documents to cover up the Daniels payment.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels. Blanche urged jurors to look past the salacious details and focus on the paperwork at the heart of the case.\n\nHe said Trump did not know that his fixer Michael Cohen paid the hush money to Daniels, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump falsified documents when he reimbursed Cohen after the election. Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking.\n\nLater on Tuesday, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented during the six-week trial. They must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. A conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race.\n\nOutside the courtroom, prominent Biden supporters warned that Trump would erode democracy and encourage political violence if reelected. \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now he will never leave,\" actor Robert De Niro said while pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background. BLANCHE SAYS WITNESSES NOT CREDIBLE\n\nBlanche told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees. Blanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election.\n\n\"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said. He said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\nThe charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means. Those \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime. Blanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Donald J. Trump, the former president's lawyer claiming his client is innocent and accusing prosecutors of falsely alleging a criminal scheme.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, told the jury that prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Braggs' office failed to meet their burden of proving that Trump was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of tampering of business records linked to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final days of the investigation. 2016 presidential election.\n\nPresident Trump is innocent. He committed no crime and the prosecutor failed to meet his burden of proof. Period, Blanche said.\n\nFrom left, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo speaks as former President Donald Trump, 2nd right, sits between his attorneys Todd Blanche, Emil Bove and Susan Necheles during a state court hearing from Manhattan to New York, March 15, 2024. Jane Rosenberg / Reuters\n\nHe said the money Trump paid his then-lawyer Michael Cohen was actually for his legal work, as Trump company records show, and not to pay Daniels, as prosecutors and Cohen argued. He noted that Trump was president when he signed the monthly checks for Cohen in 2017, and that the idea that he was part of a \"scheme\" to hide the payments at the time was \"absurd.\"\n\nBlanche said Cohen testified that he did very little legal work for Trump in 2017, but Cohen lied to you.\n\nBlanche told the jury that Cohen worked as co-lead attorney defending a defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's former reality TV show, The Apprentice.\n\nThe payments constituted compensation to him. Nothing more, Blanche said, adding that there was no evidence, aside from Cohen's testimony, that Trump knew about his $130,000 payment to Daniels before it was made. \"You can't believe his words,\" the lawyer said.\n\nCohen had said Trump approved the payment because his campaign was reeling from the October 2016 release of the so-called \"Access Hollywood\" tape, where he was filmed in front of a hot microphone in 2005 saying he could grope women without their consent. . Blanche insisted that Trump was not very concerned about the release of the tape, leading leading Republicans to condemn his remarks and distance themselves from the then-Republican candidate.\n\nBlanche said it was an extremely personal event for President Trump \"because\" no one wants their family to be subjected to this kind of thing, but \"it wasn't an apocalyptic event.\"\n\nHe also said the deal worked well for Daniels, whom he accused of trying to extort the then-presidential candidate. She wrote a book and she has a podcast. And a documentary. It started as extortion. There's no doubt about it, and it ended very well for Ms. Daniels financially, the lawyer said.\n\nHe also claimed there was no reason for the prosecutor to have called her as a witness, other than to \"try to embarrass President Trump\" and \"inflame your emotions.\"\n\nProsecutors previously said they called her to the stand because Trump denied her claim that they had a sexual relationship in 2006, making it important that she tell her story under oath. The fact that the meeting took place, they claimed, was why he was willing to pay so much for his silence.\n\nBlanche also spoke at an August 2015 meeting in which National Enquirer publisher David Pecker told Trump and Cohen that he would help them suppress negative stories about Trump while publishing articles to demolish his rivals. Prosecutors described it as the start of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. Every campaign is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, Blanche said. There was no criminal intent during this 2015 meeting.\n\nAfter the prosecution and defense have presented their final arguments, the judge will instruct the jury. Then, the 12 ordinary New Yorkers who serve on the jury will begin their deliberations to determine whether or not the former president is guilty of the charges against him. \"You and you alone are judges of the facts in this case,\" said Judge Juan Merchan before the proceedings.\n\nThe charge is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, and Trump is charged with 34 counts.\n\nThree of Trump's children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, were in court for the proceedings.\n\nBlanche estimated her argument would take about two and a half hours, while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass estimated it would take a little more than four hours.\n\nProsecutors are expected to argue that not only did they prove that Trump was responsible for the falsified business records, but that he did so to cover up another crime, a necessary element of the felony charge.\n\nIn his opening statement, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said the disguised payment to Cohen was part of a long-planned and coordinated plot to influence the 2016 election, helping Donald Trump get elected through illegal spending, to silence people who had something bad to say. on his behavior, using falsified company documents and bank forms to conceal these payments along the way.\n\nIt was electoral fraud. Plain and simple, he told the jury.\n\nOnce the summaries are complete, Merchan will explain to the jury the relevant laws and the deliberation process, which is expected to last approximately an hour. The jury will then begin to deliberate. Mercan said in court last week that deliberations might not begin until Wednesday morning.\n\nThe trial, which included testimony from Cohen, Daniels, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and former White House and Trump Organization staffers, began with jury selection on April 15. Testimony, which began April 22, concluded last week. In total, the prosecution called 20 witnesses in this case, while the defense called two. Although he said before the proceedings began that he would \"absolutely\" testify, Trump did not take the stand in his own defense.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Following an investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, Trump was indicted in March 2023 on 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Cohen, then a Trump lawyer, during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels alleged she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Tuesday.\n\n\"Trump has an uphill battle in front of him, given the substantial evidence introduced by the prosecution in the trial,\" Ring told Newsweek. \"We will be hearing a lot about Michael Cohen's lack of credibility, felony convictions, admitted lying under oath, and admitted theft of money from Trump's business.\n\n\"Cohen is the linchpin. Any juror in any case would be reluctant to convict any defendant, much less Donald Trump, based on Michael Cohen's testimony, background and all the baggage he brings with him.\n\n\"Trump will also highlight the thin legal underpinnings of the case. What is the underlying crime that Trump broke in paying hush money to Stormy Daniels? Election fraud? Did the prosecution make it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that some election fraud law was violated?\"\n\nRing said that Trump's team will also be relying on the fact that Trump is a former president.\n\n\"The elephant in the jury room is the pressure these jurors will be facing by being asked to convict a former president of the United States and to perhaps alter the course of the 2024 election,\" he said. \"Are they willing and able to unanimously convict Trump? All it takes is a single holdout and it is a mistrial.\"\n\nBlanche told the jury during closing arguments that a $420,000 payment from Trump to Cohen were for legal services, not to repay hush money Cohen gave to Daniels. Blanche said that Cohen demanded his annual bonus, not repayment.\n\n\"Do you believe that for a second...that after getting stiffed on his bonus in 2016, when he thought he had worked so hard...do you think that Mr. Cohen thought, 'I'm going to work for free?'\" Blanche asked jurors.\n\n\"The idea that President Trump would agree to pay Mr. Cohen $420,000, even though he only owed him $130,000,

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence lawyer Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting\" and that the prosecution's star witness told \"lies\" in the witness box and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"A not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\nAfter more than four weeks of evidence, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent an adult film actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof in the case, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough evidence to convict Trump of all charges while defence lawyers will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nAfter closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, probably on Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nThe deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a 130,000 dollar (\u00a3101,000) payment Mr Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Ms Daniels' account, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who said that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying 150,000 dollars (\u00a3117,000) to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a year-long affair with Trump; and Mr Cohen, who said that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions - \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump has denied a relationship with Ms McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses - neither of them Trump.\n\nThey focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nMr Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they will not be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence - and there were many.\n\nJudge Juan M Merchan, for instance, fined Trump 10,000 dollars (\u00a37,800) for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBut it is unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It marks the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been tried on criminal charges.\n\nTrump last April pleaded not guilty to a 34-count indictment charging him with falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"It's a paper case,\" defense attorney Todd Blanche says. \"This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago. An encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred. It's not even about a settlement in 2016.\"\n\n\"The bookings were accurate. And there was absolutely no intent to defraud,\" he said. \"And beyond that, there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\"\n\nStarting a PowerPoint showing the evidence, Blanche quickly seeks to made the case a referendum on the credibility of Michael Cohen, telling jurors he lied on the witness stand.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies, pure and simple,\" Blanche continued.\n\n\"The words that Michael Cohen said to you on that stand -- they matter.

Every member of Trump's family is looking at him.

The line appeared to be the longest of the entire trial.\n\nThe courtroom itself is a balmy 76 degrees this morning, after weeks of chilly temperatures that prompted Trump to complain about sitting in the cold conditions.\n\nMay 28, 8:32 AM\n\nSons, daughter expected to join Trump in court\n\nFormer President Trump is expected to be joined by a number of his children for today's critical day in court.\n\nTrump is set to be accompanied by his sons Eric and Don Jr., his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, and -- for the first time -- his daughter Tiffany, according to the Trump campaign.\n\nIt would be the largest family showing for Trump since the criminal trial began six weeks ago.\n\nMay 28, 6:56 AM\n\nJury to hear closing arguments\n\nAfter five weeks of testimony, jurors in former President Trump's hush money case are scheduled to hear closing arguments today.\n\nProsecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office and attorneys for Trump are both set to deliver closing

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nSign Up For Free: Denver AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local SavingsACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE DENVER GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "denvergazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

This case is about Donald Trump and whether he should be held accountable,\" he added.\n\n- Graphic testimony - More from this section Shelter dog has been waiting 2 years for a home Expelled doctor accused of faking cancer, defrauding another doctor Ujjwal Nikam Exclusive: 'PM Modi's Govt takes Decisive and Bold Decisions and That's Why I said Yes'\n\nSpeaking to reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nThe 12 anonymous jurors will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden and the verdict will inject new tension into the White House race.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nThe first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, Trump faces charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense.\n\nInstead, he used his trips to court to stage tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/dw", "source":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDEFENSE IMPLORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside the courtroom, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Cohen took the stand.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nTrump has used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_walton@fox28spokane.com", "name":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Once Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified business documents to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter.Donald Trump's lawyer told jurors on Tuesday that prosecutors had failed to prove the former president was guilty of falsifying documents as the defense team began its closing argument in Trump's criminal hush-money trial.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said as the trial resumed after a week-long break.\n\nAfter six weeks of trial, Blanche was making his final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether Trump will become the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nIn his closing argument, Blanche will try to convince jurors that Trump, the businessman-turned-politician, did not cover up evidence of a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to advance his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nOnce Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified business documents to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, overseeing the trial, said he would ask jurors to stay late so both sides could complete their arguments on Tuesday. That would allow jurors to begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" he told jurors.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. They will make their presentation after the defense, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Trump's lawyers have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanor under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's landmark hush money trial turns on the testimony of a prosecution witness who told lies on the stand and cannot be trusted, a defense lawyer said Tuesday during closing arguments as he pressed jurors for an acquittal in the first criminal case against a former American president.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating Trump's fate.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple.\"\n\nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nBlanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year. While Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organization controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

The lawyer claimed prosecutors failed to prove that Trump covered up a hush money payment. Trump faces 34 felony counts, but his lawyer emphasized the lack of evidence and credibility of key witnesses.\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer cast the former U.S. president as a victim of a porn star's blackmail and argued that prosecutors had failed to prove he covered up a hush money payment to her as Trump's historic criminal trial neared a conclusion on Tuesday.\n\nIn his closing argument, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said porn star Stormy Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story of a sexual encounter as he battled a string of unflattering stories in the final weeks of the 2016 election. \"She was trying to use the 2016 election as leverage to try and get paid,\" Blanche told the 12 jurors who will decide whether Trump, 77, becomes the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe jury could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday. During the trial, Daniels testified in unflattering detail about a 2006 encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament. Trump, president from 2017-2021, denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nHis lawyers have said he paid her off to protect his family from embarrassment, not to boost his campaign as prosecutors allege. Trump, the 2024 Republican candidate for president, faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Blanche urged jurors to look past the salacious details and focus on the paperwork at the heart of the case.\n\nHe said prosecutors had failed to prove that Trump, the 2024 Republican candidate for president, illegally falsified documents to cover up the $130,000 Daniels payment. Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office say that payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking.\n\nLater on Tuesday, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented during the six-week trial. They must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. \"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" Justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case, told jurors.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race. Outside the courtroom, prominent Biden supporters warned that Trump would erode democracy and encourage political violence if reelected. \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now he will never leave,\" actor Robert De Niro said while pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nBLANCHE SAYS WITNESSES NOT CREDIBLE Blanche told jurors they could not rely on the testimony of Daniels or of lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nCohen testified that he paid Daniels $130,000 out of his own pocket and Trump paid him back after the election, disguising those payments as monthly legal fees. Blanche said those payments were indeed monthly legal fees, as Cohen served as Trump's personal lawyer during that time.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger, and emphasized that the payments were publicly reported. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law. \"If there was some deep-rooted intent to defraud, why do you think it was reported to the IRS as exactly what it was?\" Blanche said, referring to the U.S. tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard about Cohen's felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company. The charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means.\n\nThose \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes. If found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up. He said Trump had done nothing improper by working with tabloid publisher David Pecker to suppress stories that might have hurt his campaign. \"It doesn't matter if there was a conspiracy to try to win an election,\" he said. \"You have to find that this effort was done by unlawful means.\"\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said as the trial resumed after a week-long break.\n\nAfter six weeks of trial, Blanche was making his final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether Trump will become the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nIn his closing argument, Blanche will try to convince jurors that Trump, the businessman-turned-politician, did not cover up evidence of a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to advance his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nOnce Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified business documents to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, overseeing the trial, said he would ask jurors to stay late so both sides could complete their arguments on Tuesday. That would allow jurors to begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" he told jurors.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law. They will make their presentation after the defence, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"Why can't the defence go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Trump's lawyers have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanour under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $130,000 payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news",

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nRelated Story: Opinion: Likelihood of Trump Seeing the Inside of a Cell Is Increasing\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nRelated Story: The Latest | Defense Rests Its Case Without Trump Testifying in His Hush Money ...\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press",

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said as the trial resumed after a week-long break.\n\nAfter six weeks of trial, Blanche was making his final bid to influence the 12 jurors who decide whether Trump will become the first US president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nIn his closing argument, Blanche will try to convince jurors that Trump, the businessman-turned-politician, did not cover up evidence of a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to advance his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nOnce Blanche finishes, prosecutors will sum up the witnesses and evidence they have presented as they argue Trump, 77, illegally falsified business documents to cover up the payment that ensured Daniels would not go public with her story of a 2006 sexual encounter.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan, overseeing the trial, said he would ask jurors to stay late so both sides could complete their arguments on Tuesday. That would allow jurors to begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday.\n\n\"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in this case,\" he told jurors.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by US law. They will make their presentation after the defence, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"Why can't the defence go last? Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said on social media early on Tuesday.\n\nOver the course of the trial, Trump's lawyers have tried to raise doubts about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, most notably Michael Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he handled the payment to Daniels and that Trump approved the cover-up.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Trump's lawyers got Cohen to discuss his felony convictions and imprisonment, his history of lying and his lingering animosity for his former boss. Cohen also admitted to stealing from Trump's company.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden as the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 election, and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won. Opinion polls show the two candidates locked in a tight race.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, normally a misdemeanour under New York law.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated those charges to felonies, saying Trump falsified those records to disguise what amounted to an illegal campaign contribution: the payment that bought Daniels' silence about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter at a time when Trump was already facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. His lawyers have implied that the $US130,000 ($A195,330) payment for Daniels' silence was intended to spare Trump's family from embarrassment, not to protect his White House bid. Prosecutors will cite testimony to argue otherwise.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments , including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress.

Jurors will be tasked with deciding whether the allegation that Trump approved the hush money payments and sought to break the law by falsely recording them was part of a broader criminal scheme or an effort to avoid the embarrassment.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with payments Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The government is seeking to convince the jury that Trump sought to hide the payments in order to commit another crime and that that is enough to convict him in this legally complex case.\n\nHere's what you missed during 20 days in court for Trump's secret trial:\n\nBelieve the star witness\n\nTrump talked bulls -- - as Daniels recounted the alleged tryst that she said resulted in her receiving $130,000 days before the 2016 election to stay silent.\n\nBut Trump said little as a parade of former aides and associates took the witness stand, where they recounted the events that led prosecutors to indict him on 34 counts.\n\nSitting just feet away, Cohen, his former fixer, testified that Trump and his top financial official were involved in a scheme to disguise the repayment of his payment to Daniels as a legal retainer. Cohen said that when he later faced legal risks for violating campaign finance law by coordinating the secret payments, he faced a pressure campaign from people around Trump that he considered it an attempt to prevent him from turning around.\n\nCohen admitted to calling Trump a gross-out cartoon misogynist and Cheeto-sprinkled villain who should be caged like an animal, even though he engaged in behavior unrecognizable to people who had known him for years.\n\nA defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, urged the judge not to let this case go before the jury, relying on the testimony of Mr. Cohen, that of an admitted liar who, during the trial, admitted to having stole tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization.\n\nBlanche sowed doubt over a phone call later in October 2016, when Cohen claimed to have discussed paying Daniels with Trump, showing the court text messages suggesting that Cohen had spoken with Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, at about the crazy calls he was receiving at the same time. . Cohen responded that he could have discussed both topics on the call.\n\nBlanche also posted a January 2017 email from Trump Organizations' CFO asking Cohen to prepare the deal we discussed so we could pay you monthly after Cohen claimed the repayment plan was supposed to be secret and had never been committed in writing.\n\nWhile the email could be read as confirmation that Trump and Allen Weisselberg, then the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, were involved in the plan, it also raised new questions about Cohen's conception of the project.\n\nBelieving Trump when we haven't heard from him\n\nAlthough he said he absolutely intended to testify, Trump ultimately did not. Instead, he remained largely silent at the defense table as smears and accusations spread through the courtroom and lawyers recounted gripping stories of infidelity, theft and deception. .\n\nResponding to reports that he could be seen sleeping in court, Trump claimed he was simply resting his beautiful blue eyes while listening intently to the proceedings to better understand EVERYTHING!!!\n\nAt the start of the trial, tabloid impresario David Pecker explained how he helped detect and kill damaging stories about Trump, a plan that Pecker said was concocted with Trump and Cohen during a meeting at the Trump Tower as Trump, his longtime friend, prepared a presidential bid.\n\nBut Pecker didn't want to pay for Daniel's story, and he advised Cohen to do so, leading to a scramble to find the money for a deal that Cohen said deserved Trump's approval. Prosecutors say the plan was in service of a scheme to defraud American voters by intervening in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNo, ma'am, Cohen told prosecutors when asked if he would have ever paid for Daniel's nondisclosure agreement himself.\n\nDaniels also told the court that Cohen sought to delay payment until after the election, when the story would no longer matter.\n\nTrump's lawyers sought to portray Daniels' demands as an extortion attempt.\n\nWhether the jury finds that Cohen was motivated by revenge or that Daniels was motivated by profit, as the defense claimed, may be of no consequence.\n\nCohen offered no testimony linking Trump to the crime of avoiding campaign disclosures, and he was the only witness who testified that Trump personally discussed the reimbursement.\n\nHow the two sides argue\n\nProsecutors will present their closing arguments Tuesday and will try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of directing a cover-up of business records with the intent to commit another crime and that he sought to cover up the commission of that crime.\n\nThe facts of who paid whom and when are not in dispute, with nearly a dozen checks addressed to Cohen and signed by Trump entered into evidence. Trump denies any falsehoods about the payments, even though they didn't happen.\n\nThe burden on Trump's lawyers is less. The defense will have to plant doubt in jurors' minds that while Trump may have made the payments, the allegation that he orchestrated a broader plan to influence the election has not been proven.\n\nThe indictment alleges that 11 checks were issued from the Trump Revocable Trust and Trump's personal bank account for fraudulent purposes and, along with falsified accounting entries and invoices, formed the basis of a scheme to conceal a secret payment of $130,000 to Cohen.\n\nEach check was processed by the Trump Organization and illegally disguised as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a nonexistent service contract, Braggs' office said.\n\nAfter the defense's closing arguments, State Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury on how to interpret the evidence and the law.\n\nCourt of public opinion\n\nDefense witness Robert Costello delivered the final blow to Cohen's credibility, telling the court that Cohen repeatedly told him I had nothing on Donald Trump. Cohen told him he did it on his own, Costello testified. Cohen said it was because he didn't trust Costello.\n\nAs he bitched and grumbled on the stand, huffing and puffing amid sustained objection, Costello tested Merchan's patience. Are you looking down on me right now? Merchan scolded before momentarily ordering the courtroom cleared.\n\nThis moment gave Trump allies fodder to suggest that Merchan was acting unfairly against him. Merchan showed his bias in that moment, said law professor Alan Dershowitz, who sat behind Trump last week.\n\nNever mind that Costello, under heated cross-examination, squirmed when presented with emails and files revealing his denials to be false, including Cohen's claim that Costello had offered a purported channel of return to Trump when he was in danger of being legally threatened.\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger produced an email in which Costello wrote to his law partner about the need to put Cohen on the right page without making him feel like we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president, a reference to the former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFor Trump, who never took the stand himself, Costello offered the defense a chance to challenge Cohen's account from someone who had heard his contrary claims at the time.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, accused Bragg of leading a politically motivated witch hunt and Cohen of being an embittered former employee determined to target him at all costs.\n\nTo deliver this message, Trump has relied on a parade of allies and surrogates, from the Speaker of the House to potential vice presidential candidates, to launch attacks that he is prohibited from making by order of the House. silence. One group recorded a campaign ad from the courthouse.\n\nTrump was also able to speak to reporters on cameras outside the courtroom, and he fired off dozens of fundraising missives during the trial.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He raised his left hand in a fist as he left the courtroom for lunch but did not address the assembled media.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier before entering the Manhattan courtroom, Trump said \"this is a very dangerous day for America.\"\n\n\"We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" he said as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him.\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nPolls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a \"clown\" and \"grubby real estate developer\" intent on destroying the country.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks and days of gripping testimony by Daniels and Cohen, is the only one likely to come to trial by election day on November 5.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nA conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nUnanimity required\n\nTrump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he used his daily trips to court to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail.\n\nA number of Republican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be his vice president, have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri":

The trial centers on a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to suppress an alleged affair story before the election. Jurors will soon deliberate.\n\nA New York prosecutor told jurors that Donald Trump engaged in a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 election and then tried to cover it up, as lawyers made their closing arguments in the former U.S. president's criminal hush money trial on Tuesday. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors they would need to assess whether Trump, 77, falsified business documents to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut he said they also needed to consider broader political concerns, such as the possibility that Trump and allies like tabloid publisher David Pecker undermined the election by controlling what information would reach voters. \"This scheme, cooked up by these men at this time, could very well be what got President Trump elected,\" Steinglass said.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as soon as Wednesday. Steinglass spoke after a lawyer for Trump urged jurors to set aside their personal views of Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential candidate and instead determine whether prosecutors had proven their case.\n\n\"If you focus just on that evidence you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very quick and easy not guilty verdict,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said. The case stems from a $130,000 payment in the final weeks of the 2016 election that ensured porn star Stormy Daniels would not tell voters her story of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nBlanche said Daniels had been trying to extort Trump by threatening to go public with her story as he battled a string of unflattering stories of sexual misconduct in the final weeks of the 2016 election. Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels. Steinglass said it was irrelevant if Daniels was seeking a payday, because Trump broke the law by covering up evidence that his fixer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to keep quiet.\n\n\"You don't get to commit election fraud or falsify business records because you think you've been victimized,\" Steinglass said. Prosecutors say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking.\n\nSteinglass referred to the testimony of Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who had described an agreement with Trump to pay for and bury stories that might have hurt his candidacy. Prosecutors must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law.\n\nBlanche drew a reprimand from the judge overseeing the trial for telling jurors the evidence was insufficient to send Trump to prison. Jurors are tasked with assessing guilt or innocence while judges determine punishment of those found guilty. Justice Juan Merchan told jurors after they returned from lunch to ignore that statement. \"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" he said before prosecutors began their closing argument.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race. IS COHEN CREDIBLE?\n\nBlanche told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees. Blanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election.\n\n\"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said. He said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\nSteinglass said Cohen's dishonesty was a reflection of Trump's malign influence. \"Mr. Trump not only corrupted those around him. He also got them to lie to cover it up,\" Steinglass said.\n\nThe charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means. Those \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime. Blanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election. Separate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

AP\n\nIn the final day of former US President Donald Trump's 'hush money' trial in New York, his defence team on Tuesday argued that he was innocent and that there was \"no shred of evidence\" in the testimony of Michael Cohen, a key witness of the prosecution.\n\nThe defence and prosecution will close their arguments on Tuesday. After that, the 12-member jury will start their deliberations in the case.\n\nIn the historic trial, Trump is facing 34 felony counts for allegedly falsifying business records to pay hush money to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential elections. The prosecutors have said the payment was made to buy her silence about an alleged extramarital affair between the two. Trump is the first US president -- sitting or former -- to face a criminal trial in the American history.\n\nIn the trial that ran for over five weeks, more than 20 witnesses took the stands.\n\nTrump's defence team pokes hole in prosecution's case\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche started the closing arguments by saying that his client was innocent and that the prosecution has failed to provide the burden to proof to hold him guilty.\n\nBlanche went on to dismiss two of witnesses in the case, Cohen and Keith Davidson, and said that the jury should want much more than their testimonies to decide the case against Trump.\n\n\"The evidence should leave you wanting more. You should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen&mldr;You should demand more than the testimony of Keith Davidson, an attorney who really was just trying to extort money from President Trump in the lead up to the 2016 election,\" said Blanche, as per CNN.\n\nBlanche further said that Cohen's testimony was \"pure and simple lies\". Cohen is key element of the case. The case is related to the $130,000 paid to Daniels in hush money by Cohen allegedly at the behest of Trump. Later, the prosecution has alleged, Trump reimbursed Cohen the $130,000 in a manner that involved falsifying business records and violation of election campaign finance laws.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said Trump, Cohen, and Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg agreed that Cohen would be reimbursed in \"monthly installments by sending fake invoices to the Trump Org each month\", according to CNN. Colangelo said it was a \"clever way to pay Cohen back without being too obvious about it\".\n\nBlanche further said that Trump had nothing to do with the cheques paid to Cohen by sons Eric and Don Jr.\n\n\"Both of these checks were approved by Eric and Don Jr., and President Trump had nothing to do with them. There's no evidence he had anything to do with anything involving these checks,\" said Trump.\n\nCan Trump go to jail in hush money case?\n\nTheoretically, yes, Trump can go to jail if he is convicted.\n\nIf convicted, Trump could face a four-year prison term for each of the 34 counts, according to AFP.\n\nMoreover, the news agency said that experts are of the view that Trump is unlikely to be jailed as a first-time offender.\n\nA conviction would, however, not stop him from running for the 2024 US presidential election or even running the country from jail if he wins while being imprisoned.\n\nRichard L Hasen, a leading expert on US election laws, told CNN that the law says nothing about a person not being able to run for presidency or serve as president if convicted.\n\n\"The Constitution has very few requirements to serve as President, such as being at least 35 years of age. It does not bar anyone indicted, or convicted, or even serving jail time, from running as president and winning the presidency&mldr;How someone would serve as president from prison is a happily untested question,\" said Hasen.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Davidson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keith Davidson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-55-2024-04-ee789aef977443693a903033359c3f34.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nDonald Trump is accused of falsifying business records to repay his lawyer for a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, seen here in January 2019\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former personal attorney, has become a vocal critic of his ex-boss and was a key witness in the trial\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of evidence, the day-long summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election.\n\nThe political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nMr Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ms Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered - including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit - were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true\".\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nHe told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nMr Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Ms Daniels 130,000 dollars (\u00a3101,000) to keep quiet.\n\nMr Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress.\n\nHe went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Mr Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nDefence lawyers say Mr Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hours-long address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Mr Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organisation for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staff were doing with the payments.\n\nHe disputed the contention that Trump and Ms Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Mr Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT\", used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time\", Mr Blanche labelled Mr Cohen the \"GLOAT\" - \"greatest liar of all time\".\n\nThe lawyer also called Mr Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt\".\n\nThat language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump.\n\nBut he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost, saying: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result.\"\n\nMr Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defence's assertion that Mr Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Mr Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nMr Cohen's actual call to Mr Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.\n\nMr Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Mr Cohen could have spoken to Mr Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Mr Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Mr Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Trump denies wrongdoing and says he never had sex with Daniels.\n\nSteinglass said it was irrelevant if Daniels was seeking a payday, because Trump broke the law by covering up evidence that his fixer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to keep quiet.\n\n\"You don't get to commit election fraud or falsify business records because you think you've been victimized,\" Steinglass said.\n\nProsecutors say the Daniels payment amounted to an improper campaign contribution because it kept voters from learning about an alleged affair that could have swayed their decisionmaking.\n\nSteinglass referred to the testimony of Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who had described an agreement with Trump to pay for and bury stories that might have hurt his candidacy.\n\nProsecutors must prove Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the level of certainty required by U.S. law.\n\nBlanche drew a reprimand from the judge overseeing the trial for telling jurors the evidence was insufficient to send Trump to prison. Jurors are tasked with assessing guilt or innocence while judges determine punishment of those found guilty.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan told jurors after they returned from lunch to ignore that statement. \"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" he said before prosecutors began their closing argument.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Nor will it prevent him from taking office if he wins. Opinion polls show the two men locked in a tight race.\n\nIS COHEN CREDIBLE?\n\nBlanche told jurors they could not trust Cohen, who testified that as Trump's fixer he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and worked out a plan with Trump to be reimbursed through payments disguised as legal fees.\n\nBlanche reminded them that Cohen had previously admitted to lying under oath, and said Cohen had lied again during the trial when he testified that he had spoken with Trump about paying off Daniels before the election.\n\n\"He is literally the greatest liar of all time,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe said there was no evidence that Trump knew anything about how those payments were characterized in his company's ledger. Prosecutors must prove that Trump knowingly broke the law.\n\nSteinglass said Cohen's dishonesty was a reflection of Trump's malign influence.\n\n\"Mr. Trump not only corrupted those around him. He also got them to lie to cover it up,\" Steinglass said.\n\nThe charges brought against Trump are misdemeanors on their own but prosecutors elevated them to felonies on the grounds that Trump was trying to cover up another crime - that of promoting a candidacy for political office by unlawful means.\n\nThose \"unlawful means,\" prosecutors will argue, include excessive campaign contributions, tax violations, and other business records-related crimes.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nBlanche said prosecutors had not proven that there had been any underlying crime to cover up.\n\nTrump faces three other criminal prosecutions as well, but none is likely to go to trial before the election.\n\nSeparate cases in Washington and Georgia accuse him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat, while another case in Florida charges him with mishandling classified information after he left office in 2021.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases and says they are an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to hobble his presidential bid.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen and Luc Cohen in New York and Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Howard Goller)", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "},

He was accompanied by his daughter Tiffany and two of his sons, Eric and Donald Jr. The defense summation is expected to take up to two and a half hours, while the prosecution could take up to about four and a half.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Trump's attorney Todd Blanche said moments into his closing, after he started by thanking the jury for their service.\n\n\"The evidence is all in. It all came in as of last Tuesday. And that evidence, as I said to you on April 22, should leave you wanting more.\"\n\nFor weeks, testimony has gripped America and the world amid the prospect that the former US president could be found guilty of a crime. Trump, who is almost certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination, is charged with falsifying business records related to paying the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged sexual liaison.\n\nProsecutors argue that the payments amount to election interference as Trump was running in the 2016 race for the White House at the time and seeking to cover up a potentially damaging scandal.\n\nBut as details of the case and Trump's liaison with Daniels have been brought before a Manhattan jury, they have had seemingly little impact on the 2024 race - where Trump still often narrowly leads Joe Biden in head-to-head polls and is performing strongly in the swings states that are crucial to victory.\n\nTrump denies all the allegations.\n\nThe trial has played out in remarkable scenes in which Trump has been in court and largely kept off the campaign trial, except at weekends and some events in and around New York City. Despite admonishments from the court, he has continued to rail against his prosecutors, and Judge Juan Merchan, on social media, labelling the trial as a \"witch-hunt\".\n\nCentral to the case is the testimony of Trump's former lawyer and once-feared fixer Michael Cohen. Cohen gave vital evidence for the role that Trump played in the alleged hush-money scheme, but was also brutally grilled by Trump's lawyers for his previous history of lying and his evident dislike of his former boss and desire to see him behind bars.\n\nWhat weight the jury places on the reliability of Cohen's testimony is likely to decide the case one way or the other. If found guilty, Trump could face the prospect of jail, though that is mostly seen as unlikely. Any guilty verdict would also almost certainly trigger a lengthy series of appeals.\n\nIn his closing, Blanche repeatedly hammered on Cohen's credibility. \"The words that Michael Cohen said to you on that stand, they matter. They matter,\" Blanche said. \"He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies.\"\n\nHe emphasized that the invoices in the case were submitted by Cohen, adding: \"You cannot convict President Trump. You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the word of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nBlanche urged jurors to want more than Cohen's testimony and, referring to Daniels, \"something beyond the word of a woman who claims that something happened in 2006\".\n\nHe also insisted that the key allegation of prosecutors - that business records were falsified because they wrongly claimed that repayments were for legal services - fell flat, insisting that Cohen was Trump's personal lawyer and \"was rendering services to President Trump in 2017 as his personal attorney\".\n\nTrump also faces three other criminal trials: one for trying to sway the 2020 election in Georgia, another for his conduct around the January 6 attack on the Capitol and a third one related to his treatment of sensitive documents after he left the White House.

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nProsecutors are \"perfectly happy to have a witness commit perjury, to lie to you,\" Blanche told the jury in his closing arguments, as quoted by CNN, going on to describe Cohen as \"the MVP of liars.\" (Prosecutors objected to the statement, which the judge sustained.)\n\nBlanche also took issue with Daniels' testimony -- as she said under oath she and Trump had a sexual encounter and suggested he coerced her to have sex -- claiming prosecutors called the adult film star to testify in order to \"try to inflame [the jury's] emotions, they did it to try to embarrass President Trump,\" as quoted by CNN. The Trump attorney described Cohen's payment to Daniels as \"extortion\" and noted Daniels previously denied having an affair with Trump. Jurors do not have to believe Daniels' allegations in order to convict Trump, however, given that the case is just based on whether his reimbursement checks were labeled falsely.\n\nThe jury will start deliberations once closing arguments end and the judge has delivered instructions to the jury. It's unclear how long it will take before they reach a verdict. If Trump is convicted, each felony count against him is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 per offense and/or up to four years in prison, meaning Trump faces up to $170,000 in fines and 136 years in prison if he were convicted on every count and sentenced to the maximum. Legal experts believe it's unlikely Trump would be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender -- though it's not out of the question. His sentencing would likely take place one or two months after the verdict.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and decried the case as a \"witch hunt\" designed to hurt his campaign. The ex-president complained Monday on Truth Social that his lawyers are making their arguments first, saying allowing prosecutors to go last is a \"BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR.\" The order is not unique to his case, however: defense attorneys are required to give their closing arguments first under New York law, given that prosecutors are the ones who must provide the burden of proof showing Trump's guilt.\n\nTrump was indicted in Manhattan in March 2023 following a yearslong investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and this case marks the first of his four criminal cases to go to trial. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 election in order to cover up her allegations of an affair, which Trump has long denied. Trump then reimbursed Cohen through a series of checks paid throughout 2017 that prosecutors argue were falsely labeled as being for legal services, which Trump also denies. Cohen later pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes stemming from his payment to Daniels, and testified during the weekslong trial that Trump was directly involved with both the hush money scheme and the repayment plan. Trump's lawyers have sought to discredit Cohen, with attorney Todd Blanche cross-examining him four three days about Cohen's frequent criticism of the ex-president and history of lying under oath. Closing arguments come after the defense presented only one major witness before resting its case last week. Attorney Robert Costello tried to undercut Cohen's testimony by testifying Cohen told him Trump had no knowledge of the hush money payment, though Costello's testimony got derailed as Judge Juan Merchan admonished him for rolling his eyes and expressing annoyance with the judge.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6655e5782124d997165e1dc0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1302,732,x0,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

No one has dared to predict when this happens. Whatever the jury decides, the verdict will not only be a milestone in the strangest electoral race in U.S. history, but also shape the expectations of Trump, who is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records over hush money paid to the porn actress Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIn a last attempt to convince the jury, or rather to confuse it, the defense centered its closing arguments on questioning the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and who says he was personally tasked with paying $130,000 to Stormy Daniels to ensure she kept quiet over her alleged affair with Trump. This payment -- which was made during the final stretch of the 2016 election campaign -- was recorded as \"legal expenses\" by the Trump Organization. But the prosecution argues the money was spent to stop the scandal from coming out and hurting Trump's chances at the polls. Cohen's statement underpins the prosecution's entire case.\n\nBut in the closing arguments, Trump's lead defense attorney, Todd Blanche, argued that Cohen's testimony couldn't be trusted. \"He. Lied. To. You,\" Blanche said of Cohen, who admitted last week on the stand not only to committing perjury, but also to stealing $300,000 from the Trump Organization. \"He came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison, you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nBlanche went on to portray Stormy Daniels as an opportunist who saw a chance to profit financially from the scandal from the notorious Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump is heard making denigrating remarks about women. The recording was leaked in September 2016, a month before the hush payment.\n\nBlanche showed the jury the bank statement where former Trump Org. CFO Allen Weisselberg summed up the $420,000 repayment to Cohen: the hush money payment, plus a bonus and taxes. The fact that Weisselberg -- the man who managed all the accounts of the Trump emporium -- has not been called to testify has raised more than a few questions. By bringing him up now, the defense seemed to reproach the prosecution for leaving out a high-ranking official and basing the entire indictment on the unreliable Cohen, who was repeatedly accused by the defense of lying. Except for the expected mention of Weisselberg -- twice convicted of fraud and perjury -- there were no further blows from the defense. At Tuesday's hearing, the former president was surrounded by almost all of his adult children.\n\nThe closing arguments were also a key moment for the prosecution, as it had to corroborate Cohen's testimony through the 34 allegedly forged documents to convince the jury that, as the former lawyer explained in his deposition, Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal from voters -- especially female voters -- information that could hurt his chances of winning the presidency. According to Cohen, he helped orchestrated a plot with Trump and tabloid publisher David Pecker to bury any stories that could possibly damage Trump's presidential bid. The hush money paid to Daniels was the final step, but not the only one: former model Karen McDougal also received money in exchange for her silence. What is on trial in New York is not an extramarital affair of the candidate for the 2016 elections, which he would end up winning, but what it subsequently entailed: the payment of hush money to ensure the scandal did not affect his presidential campaign. After the lunch break, the prosecution's conclusion was scheduled to begin.\n\nIn addition to all the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the trial -- the first of four criminal trials against the presumptive Republican nominee, and the only one to conclude before the November election -- the hearings held in the dingy Manhattan criminal court building cast an unfamiliar picture of Trump. There was Trump, a man forcibly silenced by a judge's gag order to prevent him from criticizing witnesses and court officials; an asinine, bored and sleepy Trump (Sleepy Don, as his detractors joked, copying the slogan the Republican coined in 2020 for his Democratic rival Joe Biden); a Trump who continually complained of the cold, who did look the witnesses in the eyes -- he avoided especially meeting the gaze of Daniels and Cohen -- and only seemed to bounce back in the courtroom hall, with his improvised rallies in front of the press. The usual Trump, in angry mode, then regained his belligerence on social media. This very Monday, a federal holiday on the occasion of the solemn Memorial Day, he called all his opponents \"human scum.\"\n\nIn the almost three-hour long closing arguments, Trump's lawyer did not have to convince the entire jury that his client is innocent: he only needed to stoke doubts in one juror to prevent a unanimous verdict. This could force the judge to declare the trial a mistrial, which would mean it would be held again (presumably, on dates already marked in red on the electoral calendar). Any result that does not end in a conviction would boost Trump's political goals.\n\nA sentence -- Trump is facing a maximum of four years in prison, although in practice it would be suspended because he has no criminal record -- would not prevent him from standing for election. But as it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself if he was elected in November. In the long judicial ordeal, where Trump faces with even more politically serious cases in Washington (over the assault on the Capitol), Georgia (attempted election subversion) and Florida (withholding classified documents), Trump has made a political virtue out of adversity, playing the victim to win over votes and raise campaign funds. His lead over Biden in many polls -- especially in the swing states that can decide the outcome in November -- shows that, far from hurting his chances, the legal offensive against him has strengthened his campaign.\n\nTrump has taken advantage of the priceless set offered by his entrances and exits of the courtroom to denounce again the \"electoral interference\" of \"crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country.\" \"It's going after Joe Biden's political opponent because he can't do it himself,\" said the former president on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump did nothing wrong,\" he said, citing a comment in the press. \"This is everybody saying it, except we have a judge [Juan Merchan] who is corrupt. We have a judge who is conflicted. You know what the conflict is, so do I, but I can't say it because I'm under a gag order which is another unconstitutional thing [...] This is a first. No president has not been allowed to speak,\" he added, as if \"president\" were a title granted in perpetuity.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"},

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nProsecutors are \"perfectly happy to have a witness commit perjury, to lie to you,\" Blanche told the jury in his closing arguments, as quoted by CNN, going on to describe Cohen as \"the MVP of liars\" and \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" (Prosecutors objected to the first statement, which the judge sustained.)\n\nProsecutors disputed Blanche's arguments Tuesday that Cohen can't be trusted as a witness and tried to explain Cohen's motivations to the jury, acknowledging that Cohen has an interest in the case but arguing he's \"understandably angry\" because \"he's the one who's paid the price for his role in this conspiracy\" and \"anyone in Cohen's shoes would want the defendant to be held accountable,\" as quoted by CNN. \"This case is not about Michael Cohen, this case is about Donald Trump, and whether he should be held accountable,\" Steinglass told the jury, claiming Trump's attorneys are deflecting by attacking the ex-attorney's credibility.\n\nBlanche also took issue with Daniels' testimony -- as she said under oath she and Trump had a sexual encounter and suggested he coerced her to have sex -- claiming prosecutors called the adult film star to testify in order to \"try to inflame [the jury's] emotions, they did it to try to embarrass President Trump,\" as quoted by CNN. The Trump attorney described Cohen's payment to Daniels as \"extortion\" and noted Daniels previously denied having an affair with Trump. Jurors do not have to believe Daniels' allegations in order to convict Trump, however, given that the case is just based on whether his reimbursement checks were labeled falsely.\n\nThe jury will start deliberations once closing arguments end and the judge has delivered instructions to the jury. It's unclear how long it will take before they reach a verdict. If Trump is convicted, each felony count against him is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 per offense and/or up to four years in prison, meaning Trump faces up to $170,000 in fines and 136 years in prison if he were convicted on every count and sentenced to the maximum. Legal experts believe it's unlikely Trump would be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender -- though it's not out of the question. His sentencing would likely take place one or two months after the verdict.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and decried the case as a \"witch hunt\" designed to hurt his campaign. The ex-president complained Monday on Truth Social that his lawyers are making their arguments first, saying allowing prosecutors to go last is a \"BIG ADVANTAGE, VERY UNFAIR.\" The order is not unique to his case, however: defense attorneys are required to give their closing arguments first under New York law, given that prosecutors are the ones who must provide the burden of proof showing Trump's guilt.\n\nTrump was indicted in Manhattan in March 2023 following a yearslong investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and this case marks the first of his four criminal cases to go to trial. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 election in order to cover up her allegations of an affair, which Trump has long denied. Trump then reimbursed Cohen through a series of checks paid throughout 2017 that prosecutors argue were falsely labeled as being for legal services, which Trump also denies. Cohen later pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes stemming from his payment to Daniels, and testified during the weekslong trial that Trump was directly involved with both the hush money scheme and the repayment plan. Trump's lawyers have sought to discredit Cohen, with attorney Todd Blanche cross-examining him four three days about Cohen's frequent criticism of the ex-president and history of lying under oath. Closing arguments come after the defense presented only one major witness before resting its case last week. Attorney Robert Costello tried to undercut Cohen's testimony by testifying Cohen told him Trump had no knowledge of the hush money payment, though Costello's testimony got derailed as Judge Juan Merchan admonished him for rolling his eyes and expressing annoyance with the judge.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6655e5782124d997165e1dc0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1302,732,x0,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Jurors will then undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nAs Todd Blanche resumed the defense's summation, he pointed out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging, the Associated Press noted.\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, Blanche noted that her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011, four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nTodd Blanche took aim at a key piece of prosecution evidence: the secret recording Cohen says he made of himself briefing Trump on a plan to buy the rights to McDougal's story from the National Enquirer, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and isn't about McDougal at all -- but rather a plan to buy a collection of material that the tabloid had been hoarding on Trump. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a key part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of the Biden campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nTaking aim at prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, Todd Blanche emphasized testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't even want her claim published, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRather, Blanche said the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nOn the witness stand as the last prosecution witness, Cohen stressed that he'd routinely update Trump on tasks he'd performed on his behalf so that he'd get credit for doing them. Cohen said he wanted to \"obtain credit\" so that Trump \"understood that I was accomplishing what he wanted.\"\n\nBlanche reminded jurors that Cohen acknowledged following the case closely prior to testifying, noting that Trump's aide, confidante and White House Communications Director Hope Hicks testified 10 days before he did that Cohen is \"the kind of person who seeks credit.\"\n\nTodd Blanche has taken issue with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's campaign. Blanche pointed to AMI's $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories the tabloid did not run, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBlanche pointed to Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch-and-kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" he told the jury.\n\nTodd Blanche implored the jury to reject the prosecution's contention that Trump engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nMichael Cohen got $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, they've said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nThe defense had previously argued Tuesday that Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices.\n\nThe Biden campaign has sent Robert De Niro and two former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president is stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city, but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nHe said if Trump gets reelected, \"he will never leave\" and that Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTodd Blanche argued that the key prosecution witness was lying when he said he was working for free as Trump's personal lawyer once Trump became president.\n\n\"What the government did for the past five weeks, at the end of the day, is ask you to believe the man who testified two weeks ago: Michael Cohen,\" Blanche told jurors. \"Michael Cohen asked you to ignore the documents, ignore what the email says about sending a retainer agreement sought by Mr. Weisselberg, asked you to believe that he worked for free.\"\n\nAs Trump was getting ready to move to the White House, Cohen testified he was upset that his annual Trump Organization holiday bonus had been slashed from $150,000 to $50,000. Blanche asked, in light of that frustration, was Cohen really going to work for free?\n\n\"Is that the man that testified, or is that a lie?\" Blanche asked.\n\nTodd Blanche stressed that Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" at this time Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that Trump would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nIn an effort to show Donald Trump was distant from the transactions at the heart of the charges. Blanche focused for a bit on a February 2017 email that then-Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney sent to an accounts payable staffer, telling her how to handle the payments to Michael Cohen, the Associated Press noted.\n\n\"Post to legal expenses. Put 'retainer for the months of January and February 2017' in the description,\" the email read in part.\n\nMcConney testified that he never talked to Trump about how to characterize the payments and was \"just taking information from the invoice\" Cohen had submitted.\n\nTodd Blanche is getting into the details of how payments to Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in office, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, Blanche said.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand. \"Guess who else you didn't hear from at this trial? Don or Eric,\" Blanche said.\n\nTodd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's book to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to preempt the prosecution's closing arguments.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims is that Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Daniels payment. Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year, the Associated Press.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent. \"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" Blanche said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign announced that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller says the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's. He wrote on X, formerly Twitter that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA - they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nThe defense is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to shift blame to Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche is showing the jury copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the company's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to then-President Trump, Blanche says.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThey'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics.\n\nTheir task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nAny verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nJuror 6: A young woman who lives in Manhattan and likes to dance.\n\nJuror 7: A man who is married with two children.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nJuror 11: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 12: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors":

The attorneys were provided with the judge's jury instructions on Thursday afternoon, and neither party flagged any errors, Merchan noted.\n\n'The district attorney has not met their burden of proof.'\n\nAhead of closing arguments, Merchan reminded jurors that nothing said by the attorneys constitutes \"evidence.\"\n\n\"You are the finders of fact, and it is for you and for you alone to determine the facts from the evidence,\" Merchan stated.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche presented the defense's closing argument first on Tuesday. He estimated that it would take approximately two and a half hours.\n\n\"I started out by saying something that I'm going to repeat to you right now. It's as true right now as it was on April 22. And that is President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof -- period. The evidence is all in,\" Blanche told the 12-person jury.\n\nBlanche focused the majority of his time on discrediting the prosecution's key witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, who claimed that he paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair she had with the former president. During his testimony, Cohen, a convicted felon and admitted liar, stated that he made the settlement payment to Daniels at Trump's request and that the Trump Organization reimbursed him.\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) charged Trump with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied Daniels' affair allegations.\n\nBragg's entire case hinged on the testimony of Cohen, who claimed that Trump falsified business records by marking payments to his then-personal attorney as legal expenses.\n\nBlanche argued that the government failed to corroborate Cohen's testimony.\n\n\"The evidence should leave you wanting more. You should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche told jurors. \"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago.\"\n\nHe argued that the business records were \"not false\" and that there was \"not intent to defraud.\"\n\nTrump's defense team noted that Cohen's testimony mentioned many critical conversations with individuals who were not called as witnesses in the case, including former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, Trump's former bodyguard Keith Schiller, and former National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid Cohen $35,000 monthly, a total of $420,000. Cohen claimed that the payments were partly a reimbursement for the $130,000 settlement he paid to Daniels. He also stated that Trump reimbursed him for a $50,000 payment he made to RedFinch for technology services. While on the stand, Cohen admitted to only paying RedFinch a portion of what he reported to Trump. He claimed that Trump shortchanged him on his yearly bonus and argued that \"it was almost like self-help\" to steal $60,000.\n\nBlanche told the jury, \"The idea that President Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000\" when the Daniels settlement agreement was only $130,000 \"is absurd.\"\n\nBlanche also attempted to discredit Daniels' testimony.\n\n\"Why did prosecutors call Stormy Daniels, when there was no dispute that there was an NDA settlement and she knew nothing about Trump's internal business practices?\" Blanche asked. \"I'll tell you why. They did it to try to inflame your emotions; they did it to try to embarrass President Trump.\"\n\nProsecutors attempted to object to Blanche's comment, but Merchan overruled the objection.\n\nBlanche returned to Cohen's lack of credibility.\n\n\"He's repeatedly lied under oath. He's lied to his family. He lied to his wife about the home equity line of credit ... he lied to his banker,\" Trump's attorney told jurors. \"He's literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\nBlanche provided the jury with a list of 10 reasons they should have reasonable doubt. He argued that Cohen had created the invoices and there was no evidence that Trump knew the invoices had been sent. The defense argued that there was no evidence of any intent to defraud, attempt to commit, or conceal another crime. Additionally, he contended that there was no agreement to influence the 2016 election, as the prosecution alleged.\n\nBlanche further claimed that the National Enquirer would have run the story it purchased from the former Trump Tower doorman if it had been true, but it was not. Karen McDougal wanted to keep her story private, he noted. Blanche added that Daniels' story was already public years before the settlement agreement. The defense also argued that there was manipulation of evidence.\n\nFor Blanche's final reason, he told the jurors that Cohen is \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/michael-cohen-is-an-mvp-of-liars-says-trump-s-defense-team-during-closing-arguments-in-new-york-case.jpg?id=52334468&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C180", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1009, "textEnd": 1017}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDEFENSE IMPLORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\nSign Up For Free: Denver AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" said defence attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\" In an hourslong address to the jury, Mr. Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Mr. Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\n\nTrump hush-money trial | Michael Cohen says former U.S. president was intimately involved in scheme\n\nWith sweeping denials mirroring his client's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr. Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Mr. Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr. Blanche said.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.\n\nBecause prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.\n\nTrump lawyer calls Michael Cohen a liar\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Mr. Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen. Mr. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,\" Mr. Blanche said of Cohen. \"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\" After closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.\n\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centres on a $130,000 payment Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Mr. Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nMr. Trump has denied Ms. Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Ms. Daniels.\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services. Mr. Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Mr. Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Mr. Trump that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cohen characterised that work as \"very minimal,\" Mr. Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr. Blanche sought to unravel Mr. Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Mr. Trump by phone about Ms. Daniels arrangement on October 24, 2016.\n\nMr. Cohen said he had contacted Mr. Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Mr. Trump, but Mr. Blanche asserted that at the time Mr. Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Mr. Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\" Mr. Blanche also sought to distance Mr. Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Mr. Cohen were signed as Mr. Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.\n\nHe pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Mr. Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Mr. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Mr. Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Ms. Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Mr. Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Mr. Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Mr. Cohen, who testified that Mr. Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions. \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Mr. Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump can be heard discussing paying $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has denied a relationship with Ms. McDougal too.\n\nDefence lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Mr. Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Mr. Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Mr. Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Mr. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Ms. Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Mr. Trump.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Mr. Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [],

Trump's accused of falsifying dozens of business records to conceal the payment to Daniels, part of a broader alleged scheme to influence the election with help from the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid.\n\nBlanche said that Daniels was assisted in her hush money talks by her agent Gina Rodriguez and her lawyer Keith Davidson, who arranged the deal.\n\n\"There are a group of people who wanted to take advantage and extort money from President Trump,\" Blanche said.\n\nNo 'Criminal Intent'\n\nTrump's lawyer also tried to raise doubts about the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump faces to conceal his payment to Michael Cohen, his former attorney who paid Daniels. They included vouchers that Cohen submitted, invoices that the Trump Organization prepared and checks that Trump signed. Blanche argued that the records failed to prove criminal intent by Trump.\n\nBlanche saved his most pointed vitriol for Cohen, who prosecutors used to provide the connective tissue between the records and Trump's criminal intent. Cohen, he said, was a serial liar who went from loving Trump to hating him, and then made millions of dollars on books and podcasts castigating his former boss.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is the human embodiment of reasonable doubt,\" Blanche said. \"Michael Cohen is the GLOAT - literally, the greatest liar of all time.\"\n\nBlanche said Cohen acted alone when he made the payment to Daniels, seeking to debunk his testimony that Trump authorized the deal at every step. Blanche told the jury that wasn't true, and suggested Cohen went rogue.\n\n\"If there's anything we've learned from this trial -- Michael Cohen does not take that oath seriously,\" Blanche said. \"He's lied repeatedly,\" the defense lawyer said, citing a litany of lies Cohen told to Congress, prosecutors, and most importantly, jurors at the Trump trial. \"He's like the MVP of liars.\"\n\nCohen, who was Bragg's star witness after going to prison for various crimes, spent days testifying about Trump's knowledge of the hush-money scheme. But Blanche said the jury shouldn't believe Cohen, saying he's admitted to lying under oath.\n\nBlanche also sought to defuse Trump's poor political standing in Manhattan, which is heavily Democratic.\n\n\"This isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump, this is not a referendum on the ballot box, who you voted for in 2016 and 2020, or who you plan to vote for in 2024,\" Blanche said. \"If you focused on what evidence you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very quick and easy verdict.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"},

He did not commit any crimes, and the DA has not met their burden of proof. Period.\"\n\nAfter a weeklong hiatus, both sides will spend the day in Manhattan Supreme Court court making their final pleas to the panel of New Yorkers, who will soon return to the jury room to decide the outcome of the historic case.\n\nBy New York law, Trump's side is presenting their summation first, which the GOP frontrunner blasted as a conspiracy in a string of Memorial Day Truth Social posts.\n\nAfter jurors hear final arguments from both sides, Justice Juan Merchan will instruct them on the law and how to deliberate the case.\n\nTrump walked into court at 9:25 a.m. -- for the first time, joined by both of his older sons, Eric and Don Jr., his youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, an army of lawyers, and various allies and campaign staffers. District Attorney Alvin Bragg was also present in the courtroom.\n\n\"We have a judge who's conflicted,\" Trump said outside the courtroom, possibly inching close to a potential violation of his gag order. \"You know what the conflict is, so do I, but I can't say it because I'm under a gag order which is another unconstitutional thing.\"\n\nWhat to know\n\nTrump, 77, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, each tied to his alleged reimbursement to Michael Cohen for paying off porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election -- logged in the books as payment for legal fees, not repayment for hush money.\n\nProsecutors allege the payments capped a scheme first devised by Trump, Cohen, and former tabloid publisher David Pecker in August 2015 at Trump Tower to hide information from the electorate that could influence Trump's chances.\n\nPecker was the first of 20 witnesses who testified for the prosecution during its monthlong case, testifying that he agreed to be the Trump campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by identifying negative stories that could hurt his electoral prospects to be bought and buried, running positive stories about Trump, and hit jobs targeting his competitors.\n\nThe defense called two witnesses, a paralegal and veteran New York City defense attorney Bob Costello, who accused Cohen of lying about Trump knowing he paid off Daniels. Prosecutors, on cross-examination, sought to establish the lawyer and longtime associate of Rudy Giuliani was part of a pressure campaign to stop Cohen from flipping on Trump.\n\nThe charges against Trump carry up to four years in prison or a sentence of probation and mark the first brought against a U.S. president. He faces the prospect of becoming the first person to lead the nation to be convicted of a crime while positioned as the presumed Republican nominee for president in this year's election.", "source":

Twelve Manhattan residents will then be tasked with rendering the first criminal verdict on the conduct of a former president in United States history.\n\nThe arguments - also referred to as \"summations\" - allow the two sides to bring together the vast amount of testimony and evidence jurors have taken in over five weeks. Prosecutors will argue that the evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records in order to conceal or commit another crime, while the defense team will say it comes up short.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nBlanche says Trump didn't have an intent to defraud\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said he expects Judge Merchan to instruct jurors that, to find Trump guilty, they must conclude he falsified records and that he had an intent to defraud when he did so.\n\nBlanche pointed to a 2018 tweet by Trump, in which Trump mentioned a retainer agreement with Cohen. A legal retainer is a compensation agreement that reserves a lawyer or pays for future services. Cohen submitted several invoices in 2017 - which form part of the allegedly falsified records in the case - referencing a retainer. Cohen testified no retainer actually existed.\n\nBlanche said Trump wouldn't have posted that tweet if he had any intent to defraud.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nBlanche says almost no evidence of planned tax crime\n\nTo find Trump guilty of the 34 felony counts in the case, the jurors must find not only that Trump falsified the 34 records, but also that he did so in order to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nOne of the theories the prosecution advanced about that purpose before trial was that the falsified records were covering up a plan to violate New York tax laws. The prosecution has also said there was a plan to violate New York election laws, and that the allegedly falsified records were hiding the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money to Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe only evidence of a tax purpose for how payments to Cohen were recorded, according to Blanche, was former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg saying the payments were grossed up. \"Is there any other proof of that? Any other evidence? No, there's none,\" Blanche asked and answered.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Case Turns On Cohen': Trump lawyer attacks Michael Cohen's credibility\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche displayed a portion of the transcript of Michael Cohen's testimony with a header above it titled: \"Case Turns On Cohen.\"\n\nThe transcript excerpt featured Cohen saying he was in a meeting with Trump and former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg, when Weisselberg allegedly said they would pay Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money, as well as for another expense and a bonus, over 12 months.\n\nCohen didn't even pretend to be part of that conversation, Blanche said - seeming to attack the lack of testimony from Cohen about what he himself said in the meeting. Blanche characterized it as weak evidence from the government about Trump's role in the alleged repayment scheme.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nBlanche says lack of testimony from Trump sons Eric and Don Jr. is reason to acquit\n\nBlanche argued that the lack of testimony from Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump - who are seated in the audience today - is a reason to acquit Trump. The two Trump sons were running Trump business operations during their father's presidency, and allegedly signed two checks that make up two of the 34 records that their father is allegedly responsible for falsifying.\n\n\"That is reasonable doubt,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe Trump defense team, like the prosecution, didn't call the two Trump sons to the stand, although it did call two other witnesses.\n\n\"We have no burden to do anything,\" Blanche said, emphasizing the prosecution chose to call Michael Cohen but not the sons.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nSupreme Court rejects appeal from Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Michael Avenatti\n\nOutside of the Manhattan courtroom today, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Michael Avenatti.\n\nThe disgraced California lawyer represented Daniels in her 2018 lawsuits against Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the appeal of his 2020 conviction for an extortion scheme in which he tried to get up to $25 million from shoemaker Nike.\n\nAvenatti is also serving sentences on two other convictions tied to stealing profits from Daniels' book, cheating clients out of millions of dollars, and failing to pay taxes.\n\n- Kinsey Crowley & Maureen Groppe\n\n'That's a red flag': Blanche argues lack of evidence on vouchers\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors there is \"no evidence\" Trump knew anything about the Trump Organization's voucher system. \"No evidence - not a single word,\" Blanche added.\n\nThis is a reference to a portion of the 34 records that Trump is allegedly responsible for falsifying. The vouchers were the digital entries in general ledgers at the Trump Organization that labeled payments to Michael Cohen as legal expenses.\n\nBlanche said he doesn't know how the government is going to address the alleged lack of evidence, but told jurors to be skeptical if prosecutor Joshua Steinglass reads quotes from a decades-old Trump book. During the trial, the prosecution brought in two book publishers who read excerpts from Trump's books.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\n'The bookings were accurate': Trump lawyer defends records\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche noted his client was in the White House at the time of the alleged records falsifications, arguing there wasn't evidence that Trump \"had anything to do\" with how payments to Michael Cohen were recorded on a ledger.\n\nCohen testified that Trump was in a meeting with him and former Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg about how to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. \"He approved it,\" Cohen told jurors about Trump. According to prosecutors, the reimbursement payments were falsely recorded as 2017 legal expenses.\n\nBlanche defended the accuracy of the records on Tuesday.\n\n\"The bookings were accurate and there was absolutely no intent to defraud,\" Blanche said.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\n'This case is about documents': Trump lawyer to jurors\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche noted to jurors that Trump doesn't face any charges for allegedly having a sexual encounter with porn star Stormy Daniels in 2006 - an allegation Trump denies.\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case,\" Blanche said. \"This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago,\" he added.\n\nStill, Blanche took the time to dispute Daniels' story, saying Trump has \"unequivocally and repeatedly\" denied the alleged encounter happened.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nBiden campaign to hold courthouse news conference\n\nAnother interested party is visiting the scene outside the Trump trial courthouse: The Joe Biden presidential campaign.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris campaign will hold a press conference with special guests outside of the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse,\" said an e-mailed announcement.\n\nAmong the spectators awaiting the Biden campaign news conference: Officials with the Trump campaign, who said they will be responding afterward.\n\n- David Jackson\n\n'President Trump is innocent': Trump lawyer attacks prosecution's case\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" defense lawyer Todd Blanche said early into his closing argument. \"He did not commit any crimes,\" Blanche added. \"The district attorney has not met their burden of proof - period.\"\n\nBlanche told the jurors they \"should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen,\" referring to Trump's former lawyer, who was the prosecution's star witness. Blanche also said the jurors should want more than the testimony of Deborah Tarasoff, a Trump Organization employee who testified about invoices and checks that are at the core of the 34 felony counts Trump faces.\n\nBlanche also referenced Stormy Daniels without using her name - telling jurors they should want more than a woman saying something happened in 2006. Daniels said she and Trump had a sexual encounter that year, after meeting at a celebrity golf tournament.\n\nBlanche also told jurors they should want more than the testimony of former Daniels lawyers Keith Davidson, who testified about her $130,000 hush money deal. Davidson was \"just trying to extort money\" from Trump ahead of the 2016 election, Blanche said.\n\nThe consequence of those defects in the prosecution's case, Blanche said, \"is a not guilty verdict, period.\"\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump proclaims innocence before attending closing arguments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continued to profess his innocence before closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, arguing \"there is no crime\" and \"hopefully it doesn't work out for them.\"\n\nTrump is charged with falsifying business records to hide his reimbursement to former lawyer Michael Cohen for his $130,000 payment to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels, to prevent another salacious story before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump, who didn't testify in his own defense, argued to reporters outside the courtroom that there is nothing wrong with securing a nondisclosure agreement. Trump also argued any personal payment couldn't have violated campaign finance law.\n\n\"It's a very sad day,\" Trump said. \"This is a dark day for America.\"\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nLow-key demonstrations outside the NYC courthouse\n\nAbout 50-60 people shuttled into and out of the small park across from the courthouse as lawyers inside prepared their final arguments.\n\nMost of the early witnesses were anti-Trump, but a contingent of more than 20 supporters showed up to support the former president as he traveled to the courthouse.\n\n\"We wanted to let him know that people in New York support him,\" said a Trump flag-carrying man with a white beard and a red suit who identified himself as \"Hungry Santa\" (he produced a business card with that name).Other demonstrators made clear they did not support Trump.\n\nBrad McCormick, 38, an educational consultant from Brigantine, N.J., hawked copies of a game book called \"Trump Madness.\" Readers are presented with outrageous quotes on a variety of topics, and asked if Trump really said those things (in many cases, the answer is yes).\n\nMcCormick also said he came to the courthouse out of a \"sense of duty.\"\n\nTiffany Trump, Don Jr., Eric attend closing arguments\n\nThree of former President Donald Trump's children - Donald Jr., Eric and Tiffany - accompanied him to the closing arguments Tuesday in his New York hush money trial.\n\nTrump's daughter in law, Lara Trump, who is co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also attended.\n\nA parade of SUVs delivered Trump's entourage to the local courthouse on the sunny, 70-degree morning, a day after the Memorial Day holiday.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument by thanking the jurors, noting that they have consistently arrived on time for the trial.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche estimated his side's closing argument will last about 2.5 hours. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said the length of his argument may change based on what comes up in the defense's argument, but gave an estimate of 4-4.5 hours.\n\nJudge Merchan said those estimates mean arguments and instructions may not conclude by the normal end time of 4:30 p.m. EDT and he will check whether jurors are able to stay later.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 9:31 a.m. EDT. Merchan said he sent his proposed jury instructions to both trial teams on Thursday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrived in the courtroom at 9:25 a.m. EDT. We are still waiting for the judge and jury.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlvin Bragg in attendance for closing arguments\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg entered the courtroom at 9:24 a.m. EDT. Bragg has attended some previous days of trial. He is seated in the second row of benches behind the prosecution team.\n\nThe prosecution team entered the courtroom at about 9:14 a.m. EDT. We are still waiting on Trump's trial team as well as the judge and the jury.\n\nClosing arguments offer each side a chance to go over evidence from the trial and make arguments about the inferences and conclusions that may fairly be drawn from that evidence.\n\nProsecutors may point to checks with Trump's signatures, excerpts from Trump's books, and recordings introduced at trial in order to bolster the testimony of star witness Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump authorized him to pay Stormy Daniels hush money in 2016 and approved a plan to cover it up in 2017.\n\nThe defense is likely to attack the credibility of Cohen, including by highlighting that he previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. Trump's team may also point to the high burden of proof prosecutors face: prosecutors must prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnder New York law, the defense team gives its closing argument first, followed by the prosecution. After both sides have spoken to the jurors, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct them on the law to apply in the case.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump posted a series of messages Monday, on the eve of closing arguments in his New York hush money trial, railing against the case as election interference and quoting scripture.\n\nBesides criticizing Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump questioned why the prosecution gets the final word before jury deliberations. Typically in summing up the evidence in a case, prosecutors make their statements, defense lawyers speak and prosecutors get a final rebuttal because they have the burden of proving their case.\n\n\"Big advantage, very unfair,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump also quoted a passage from the book of John in the Bible about personal sacrifice. Trump and his supporters have described his four criminal cases as political persecution.\n\n\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\" the post said.\n\nEach count against Trump carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison and no minimum amount of jail or prison time. If Trump is convicted on all counts, Merchan will be tasked with deciding on a sentence for each count, and also deciding whether the sentences will coincide with each other or be run one after the other. However, New York law caps sentences for Class E felonies such as those Trump is charged with at 20 years.\n\nLegal experts told USA TODAY it's possible Trump could get just probation, even if he were convicted on every count. Most predicted any incarceration sentence on each count would run simultaneously with the others, so Trump wouldn't be ordered to serve more than four years behind bars. Experts also said Trump would likely be free while his expected appeal ran its course.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. The records - including checks, vouchers, and invoices - all relate to payments to former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were reimbursing Cohen for $130,000 in hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, but the records were falsified to make the payments look like 2017 legal expenses.\n\nProsecutors say Trump was covering up the violation of federal campaign finance laws through the hush money, which was handed over less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. They also say Trump was trying to hide a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty, and Trump defense lawyer Todd Blanche has denied the payments were reimbursing the hush money.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy does Trump's team say the case should be dismissed?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan may issue a ruling today on Trump's request to toss out the entire case ahead of jury deliberations.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors haven't put on enough evidence for the case to go to the jury because the business records at issue weren't false. He said documents show Trump was paying Michael Cohen for ongoing legal services in 2017. Blanche also said the prosecution's case shouldn't be able to stand given Cohen's history of lying, including - according to the Trump defense lawyer - during this trial.", "source": {"uri":

He also emphasized a key point: that Cohen was the only witness brought by Bragg's office who testified that Trump knew everything about the $130,000 hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"There is no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen -- period,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche added, hitting at Cohen's dubious credibility and saying even the prosecution described him as having a history of lying.\n\nBlanche's defense strategy focused on several other key points. First, he argued that the payments made to Cohen and the Trump Organization's accounting practices were not criminal. Blanche presented excerpts from the court transcript and exhibits, including entries in the Trump Organization's business ledgers, to support this claim. He highlighted that the defense was not required to prove anything, reminding the jury that \"the burden is always on the government.\"\n\nRegarding prosecutors' allegations of election influence, Blanche dismissed the idea that Trump or David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., believed stories in the National Enquirer could sway the 2016 election. \"The idea, even if there was something wrong with it, the idea that sophisticated people like President Trump and David Pecker believed that positive stories in the National Enquirer could influence the 2016 election is preposterous,\" Blanche argued, noting the publication's limited circulation of 350,000 at the time.\n\nBlanche also attacked the notion that a criminal conspiracy formed during a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower \"when the supposed criminal conspiracy was formed.\" He emphasized that there was no discussion of \"catch and kill\" strategies or financial arrangements at that meeting. \"It wasn't even discussed at the time the conspiracy was formed. No financial discussion. No discussion about catch and kill. Think about that,\" he urged the jury.\n\nThe defense further questioned the prosecution's narrative around the 2017 Oval Office meeting where Cohen allegedly discussed hush money payments with Trump. Blanche pointed out the lack of corroboration for Cohen's testimony and highlighted that just six days after the purported meeting, Cohen did not know the exact amount of money he was to be paid. \"That's what he wants you to believe,\" Blanche said sarcastically.\n\nBlanche also presented the Office of Government Ethics forms from 2017, which disclosed payments to Cohen, arguing that there was no intent to defraud. He noted that the Trump Organization had properly reported these payments to the IRS. \"How can it be that there was any intent to defraud by President Trump when he discloses it to the IRS, he tweets about it, and he submits it on his Office of Government Ethics forms?\" Blanche asked.\n\nBlanche also emphasized that labeling expenses from a lawyer as \"legal expenses\" was standard practice and not a crime. He reminded the jury that there was no evidence Trump knew about the voucher system used by the Trump Organization to process these payments at the time he was president. \"There is no evidence that President Trump knew anything about this voucher system. No evidence. Not a single word,\" Blanche said.\n\nAs the defense delivered its closing arguments, some jurors kept keen attention on Blanche, while others kept their eyes on monitors where testimony and documents were displayed, according to CNN.\n\nThroughout his closing argument, Blanche reiterated that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of proof and that convicting Trump based solely on Cohen's unreliable testimony would be a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche said. \"He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof -- period. The evidence is all in.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAlso in the courtroom on Tuesday was Bragg, the elected Democratic district attorney, himself. Trump brought several close allies with him on Tuesday, including his adult children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and a rare appearance by Tiffany Trump.\n\nThe court took a short break on Tuesday morning before Blanche was expected to finish his closing argument ahead of a scheduled lunch break.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"},

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(Julia Nikhinson-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche used his closing arguments to continue to attack former Trump fixer Michael Cohen's credibility - a strategy that a legal expert called both expected and central to the defense's push to distance the former president from the alleged scheme to disguise hush-money reimbursements as legal fees.\n\nBlanche said the idea that the former president had time for the alleged \"scheme\" while serving as \"the leader of the free world\" was \"absurd.\"\n\nCohen previously testified about a key 2017 meeting at Trump Tower where he said Trump approved the reimbursement plan.

Each count carries up to four years in prison, which Trump would likely serve concurrently if convicted. Trump denies the charges, as well as the alleged sexual encounters.\n\nProsecutors say that the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood tapes - in which Trump is heard talking about being able to grope female genitalia because he's famous - prompted the campaign to go into overdrive to work with the National Enquirer to quash other damaging stories, including adult film star and director Stormy Daniels' account of a sexual encounter with Trump in Lake Tahoe in 2006.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blanche said Trump faced extortion and that his campaign used strategies common in the world of politics and entertainment - namely, that of NDAs and settlements - to protect his reputation and family.\n\n\"Trump is being portrayed as someone too busy and too important to really know what was going on, and this whole case has been about embarrassing Trump,\" Levenson said. \"They have also emphasized that there is nothing inherently sinister about NDAs.\"\n\nAs Blanche ended his opening statements, he urged jurors not to send Trump to prison.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Judge Juan Merchan grew \"clearly furious.\"\n\n\"Making a comment like that is highly inappropriate,\" the judge said. \"It is simply not allowed, period.

The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE Sign Up For Free: Denver AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters. Success! Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. View all of our newsletters. Featured Local Savings\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE DENVER GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "denvergazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He did not commit any crimes, and the DA has not met their burden of proof. Period.\"\n\nAfter a weeklong hiatus, both sides will spend the day in Manhattan Supreme Court court making their final pleas to the panel of New Yorkers, who will soon return to the jury room to decide the outcome of the historic case.\n\nBy New York law, Trump's side is presenting their summation first, which the GOP frontrunner blasted as a conspiracy in a string of Memorial Day Truth Social posts.\n\nAfter jurors hear final arguments from both sides, Justice Juan Merchan will instruct them on the law and how to deliberate the case.\n\nTrump walked into court at 9:25 a.m. -- for the first time, joined by both of his older sons, Eric and Don Jr., his youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump, an army of lawyers, and various allies and campaign staffers. District Attorney Alvin Bragg was also present in the courtroom.\n\n\"We have a judge who's conflicted,\" Trump said outside the courtroom, possibly inching close to a potential violation of his gag order. \"You know what the conflict is, so do I, but I can't say it because I'm under a gag order which is another unconstitutional thing.\"\n\nWhat to know\n\nTrump, 77, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, each tied to his alleged reimbursement to Michael Cohen for paying off porn star Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election -- logged in the books as payment for legal fees, not repayment for hush money.\n\nProsecutors allege the payments capped a scheme first devised by Trump, Cohen, and former tabloid publisher David Pecker in August 2015 at Trump Tower to hide information from the electorate that could influence Trump's chances.\n\nPecker was the first of 20 witnesses who testified for the prosecution during its monthlong case, testifying that he agreed to be the Trump campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by identifying negative stories that could hurt his electoral prospects to be bought and buried, running positive stories about Trump, and hit jobs targeting his competitors.\n\nThe defense called two witnesses, a paralegal and veteran New York City defense attorney Bob Costello, who accused Cohen of lying about Trump knowing he paid off Daniels. Prosecutors, on cross-examination, sought to establish the lawyer and longtime associate of Rudy Giuliani was part of a pressure campaign to stop Cohen from flipping on Trump.\n\nThe charges against Trump carry up to four years in prison or a sentence of probation and mark the first brought against a U.S. president. He faces the prospect of becoming the first person to lead the nation to be convicted of a crime while positioned as the presumed Republican nominee for president in this year's election.", "source":

He also emphasized a key point: that Cohen was the only witness brought by Bragg's office who testified that Trump knew everything about the $130,000 hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels.\n\n\"There is no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen -- period,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche added, hitting at Cohen's dubious credibility and saying even the prosecution described him as having a history of lying.\n\nBlanche's defense strategy focused on several other key points. First, he argued that the payments made to Cohen and the Trump Organization's accounting practices were not criminal. Blanche presented excerpts from the court transcript and exhibits, including entries in the Trump Organization's business ledgers, to support this claim. He highlighted that the defense was not required to prove anything, reminding the jury that \"the burden is always on the government.\"\n\nRegarding prosecutors' allegations of election influence, Blanche dismissed the idea that Trump or David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., believed stories in the National Enquirer could sway the 2016 election. \"The idea, even if there was something wrong with it, the idea that sophisticated people like President Trump and David Pecker believed that positive stories in the National Enquirer could influence the 2016 election is preposterous,\" Blanche argued, noting the publication's limited circulation of 350,000 at the time.\n\nBlanche also attacked the notion that a criminal conspiracy formed during a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower \"when the supposed criminal conspiracy was formed.\" He emphasized that there was no discussion of \"catch and kill\" strategies or financial arrangements at that meeting. \"It wasn't even discussed at the time the conspiracy was formed. No financial discussion. No discussion about catch and kill. Think about that,\" he urged the jury.\n\nThe defense further questioned the prosecution's narrative around the 2017 Oval Office meeting where Cohen allegedly discussed hush money payments with Trump. Blanche pointed out the lack of corroboration for Cohen's testimony and highlighted that just six days after the purported meeting, Cohen did not know the exact amount of money he was to be paid. \"That's what he wants you to believe,\" Blanche said sarcastically.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBlanche also presented the Office of Government Ethics forms from 2017, which disclosed payments to Cohen, arguing that there was no intent to defraud. He noted that the Trump Organization had properly reported these payments to the IRS. \"How can it be that there was any intent to defraud by President Trump when he discloses it to the IRS, he tweets about it, and he submits it on his Office of Government Ethics forms?\" Blanche asked.\n\nBlanche also emphasized that labeling expenses from a lawyer as \"legal expenses\" was standard practice and not a crime. He reminded the jury that there was no evidence Trump knew about the voucher system used by the Trump Organization to process these payments at the time he was president. \"There is no evidence that President Trump knew anything about this voucher system. No evidence. Not a single word,\" Blanche said.\n\nAs the defense delivered its closing arguments, some jurors kept keen attention on Blanche, while others kept their eyes on monitors where testimony and documents were displayed, according to CNN.\n\nThroughout his closing argument, Blanche reiterated that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of proof and that convicting Trump based solely on Cohen's unreliable testimony would be a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche said. \"He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof -- period. The evidence is all in.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAlso in the courtroom on Tuesday was Bragg, the elected Democratic district attorney, himself. Trump brought several close allies with him on Tuesday, including his adult children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and a rare appearance by Tiffany Trump.\n\nThe court took a short break on Tuesday morning before Blanche was expected to finish his closing argument ahead of a scheduled lunch break.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nJurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was given to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"},

Period,\" Todd Blanche told jurors in the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. He added that the \"hush money\" case was \"about documents\" and \"not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago\", which Trump has consistently denied.\n\nThe remarks came as the trial entered its final stretch, after hearing from 22 witnesses over the course of five weeks, including Daniels, whose alleged encounter with Trump, 77, is at the heart of the case.\n\nThe court has also heard testimony from former Trump aide Hope Hicks and from Trump's former mentee, lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who has since become one of the former president's most vocal critics.\n\nCohen paid Daniels $130,000 of his own money to buy her silence in the final days of Trump's first presidential campaign. Trump is charged with falsely recording reimbursements to Cohen as legal expenses.\n\nThe prosecution has claimed the scheme was deliberately designed to prevent damaging allegations against Trump from being made public in the run-up to the 2016 election, when his campaign was already reeling from the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which the TV personality was heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals.\n\nThe secret payments therefore amounted to an attempt to \"corrupt\" the vote, the Manhattan district attorney's office has maintained. Its final arguments will begin later on Tuesday, and are expected to last at least four hours.\n\nTrump's defence team has long argued that the former president \"had nothing to do with the invoice, with the cheque being generated, or with the entry on the ledger\".\n\nA verdict could then come as soon as Wednesday, when the seven men and five women who make up the New York jury are likely to be handed the case for deliberations following closing arguments.\n\nIf found guilty, Trump is unlikely to be jailed, but would probably face financial penalties and, if elected in November, would become the first occupant of the White House to be a convicted criminal. He is also likely to appeal against any conviction. The trial -- which comes in one of four criminal cases Trump is facing -- has so far done little to dent the presumptive Republican nominee's standing in the presidential polls.\n\nThe outcome of the case hinges in part on whether jurors believe Cohen, whose testimony directly linked Trump to the bookkeeping of the payments. Last week, the defence spent days seeking to discredit the former fixer -- who has previously been convicted of perjury -- as a serial liar hell-bent on seeing his erstwhile boss behind bars.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche told the jury, pointing out that others privy to conversations with Cohen, such as former Trump Organization accountant Allen Weisselberg, were not called to give their accounts of the facts. Weisselberg is currently serving a jail sentence for perjury and has previously been convicted of tax fraud in New York.\n\nTrump, who was joined in court by his sons Eric and Don Jr, and by his daughter Tiffany, once again decried the case as \"election interference\" in his morning remarks. \"They should have brought this case seven years ago, not in the middle of a presidential election,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person",

He added: \"This is a dark day in America.\"\n\nThe former president stands accused of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and a plan to suppress negative information, which included concealing a hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nMr Trump has been charged with 34 charges of falsifying business records and allegedly hiding the $130,000 (\u00a3104,000) hush money payments made to Ms Daniels to cover up an alleged affair.\n\nExperts say that to get a prosecution, lawyers must convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Trump falsified business records with the larger purpose of unlawfully influencing the 2016 election.\n\nMeanwhile, the defence is arguing that the former president is innocent, while slamming the testimony of Mr Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen, who is accused of transferring the hush money payments to Ms Daniels.\n\nSpeaking to the jury, Mr Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, attacked Mr Cohen's credibility as a witness, asking the jury: \"How is the government going to ask you to convict President Trump based on the words of Michael Cohen?\"\n\nThroughout the trial, the jurors have repeatedly been reminded by Mr Trump's lawyers that Cohen is a convicted felon who was imprisoned, in part for lying to Congress.\n\nMeanwhile outside the Manhattan courtroom, the Hollywood actor Robert DeNiro arrived to speak on behalf of the Biden-Harris Democrat campaign, before he called Mr Trump a \"clown\" and attacked his politics.\n\nThis latest Trump trial comes amid a swathe of cases brought against the embattled former president.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr Trump was found to have defamed the writer E Jean Carroll by claiming that she was lying about him sexually assaulting her, while he was also found to have inflated the value of his properties in New York in order to win more favourable loans.\n\nAs well as these two civil cases and the hush money trial, Mr Trump faces an additional three separate criminal indictments, which could end with the former president behind bars.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defence documents from the White House, before another indictment was filed into his alleged efforts attempting to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThis was followed by an Atlanta-based grand jury on 14 August indicting Mr Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former president's 2020 electoral defeat.\n\nHowever, many of these criminal cases have been delayed by legal appeals, meaning the hush money case could be the only one he faces before the presidential election on 5 November.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty on all criminal counts and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of evidence, the day-long summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election.\n\nThe political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nMr Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ms Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered - including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit - were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nHe told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nMr Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Ms Daniels 130,000 dollars (\u00a3101,000) to keep quiet.\n\nMr Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress.\n\nHe went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Mr Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nDefence lawyers say Mr Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hours-long address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Mr Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organisation for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staff were doing with the payments.\n\nHe disputed the contention that Trump and Ms Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Mr Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT\", used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time\", Mr Blanche labelled Mr Cohen the \"GLOAT\" - \"greatest liar of all time\".\n\nThe lawyer also called Mr Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt\".\n\nThat language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump.\n\nBut he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost, saying: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result.\"\n\nMr Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defence's assertion that Mr Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Mr Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nMr Cohen's actual call to Mr Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.\n\nMr Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Mr Cohen could have spoken to Mr Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Mr Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Mr Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com",

Ex-White House hopeful Nikki Haley pledges her vote to Donald Trump US ex-president Donald Trump vows to sue over explosive biopic\n\nTrump's defence attorney kicked off the final day of arguments, telling the jury \"President Trump is innocent.\"\n\n\"There was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by President Trump,\" he said. \"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney did not meet the burden of proof.\"\n\nProsecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors - whose identities have been kept secret for their protection - will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nGraphic testimony\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defence -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nUnanimity required\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@gulfnews.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author",

Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nGraphic testimony\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nUnanimity required\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Merchan gave the instructions after scolding Blanche before the break over the remark made near the end of the defense's summation.\n\nPROSECUTION BEGINS ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n''This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,'' Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented ''powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,'' he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen ''the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.''\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a ''political persecution'' and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a ''witch hunt.''\n\n''This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,'' he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried ''political warfare'' and said his father is the ''toughest man I've ever seen'' and ''he endures this nonsense every single day.''\n\n''I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,'' he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n''If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,'' she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a ''ridiculous comment'' and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n''I think that saying that was outrageous,'' Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. ''Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.''\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case ''isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.''\n\n''This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,'' the attorney told jurors. ''The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,'' and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick ''not guilty'' verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges ''fills me with delight.''\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from ''a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,'' Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer ''is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.''\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n''It was a lie,'' Blanche said. ''That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.''\n\nBlanche called Cohen ''literally like an MVP of liars.''\n\n''He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,'' he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as ''catch and kill.''\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n''Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?'' Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the ''Access Hollywood'' tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through ''catch and kill.''\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n''That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?'' Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the ''Access Hollywood'' tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: ''It was not a doomsday event.''\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. ''Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.''\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as ''a couple of days of frustration and consternation.''\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape ''rattled the RNC leadership'' but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n''So how could this issue have influenced the election?'' Blanche argued. ''People already knew about the allegations.''\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to ''extort'' Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n''There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,'' Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. ''There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.''\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n''What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?'' Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n''Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,'' Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro ''a washed-up actor,'' and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n''After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,'' Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign ''desperate and failing'' and ''pathetic'' and said their event outside the trial was ''a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.''\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n''This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,'' Blanche said. ''It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.''\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n''That's meaningful. That matters,'' Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n''This was not a catch-and-kill,'' Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n''The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,'' Blanche said.\n\n''Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.''\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n''That is absurd,'' Blanche told jurors, pointing to ''all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.''\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to ''destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.''\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n''It matters where President Trump was,'' Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. ''That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,'' he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n''You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,'' Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n''This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,'' Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as ''very minimal,'' Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n''Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,'' Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n''This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,'' he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with ''special guests'' as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies ''aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,'' adding: ''It's always been about politics.''\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they ''should want and expect more'' than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson ''was really just trying to extort money from President Trump'' in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n''The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,'' Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n''You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,'' Blanche said. Cohen ''told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,'' the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump ''is innocent'' of the charges against him.\n\n''He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,'' Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case ''should leave you wanting.''\n\n''This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,'' Blanche said. ''Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.''\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it ''a dark day in America'' and ''a very sad day.''\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan ''corrupt'' and ''conflicted'' but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n''We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,'' Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.", "source": {"uri":

He focused on solidifying the testimony of star witnesses Michael Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He also emphasized the role the alleged \"catch and kill\" scheme may have had in the 2016 election.\n\nThe stories purchased by Trump for the purpose of stopping them from being published were \"unlawful campaign contributions,\" according to the attorney.\n\n\"It turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign,\" Steinglass said. \"This scheme cooked up by these men at this time could very well be what got President Trump elected.\"\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche rebuked allegations that the hush-money payments and catch-and-kill scheme were part of an attempt to influence the election. He said payments to Cohen to be given to Daniels were disclosed on a 1099 form. He pushed back on the notion that Trump felt National Enquirer stories would influence the results of the 2016 election.\n\n\"The idea that even sophisticated people like President Trump and David Pecker believed that positive stories in the National Enquirer could influence the 2016 election is preposterous,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche went piece by piece through the testimony of Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, telling the jury that his testimony contained no evidence. His argument, which lasted through most of the morning, sought to attack the credibility of Cohen.\n\nTrump's defense circled back to its cross examination of Cohen about a phone call he made to Trump on bodyguard Keith Schiller's phone. Cohen said the call was about authorizing the payment to Daniels. Blanche said the call was about Cohen receiving harassing calls.\n\n\"His words cannot be trusted and I'm going to end this summation the same way I told you a few minutes ago that you know you cannot rely on him,\" Blanche said of Cohen. \"Cohen lies to family, when it matters, when it doesn't.\"\n\nBlanche also downplayed the importance of Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, arguing that the case is about business documents, not affairs. He characterized it as beginning with \"extortion\" by Daniels, who was attempting to capitalize on the Access Hollywood tape.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche told the jury. \"He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof -- period. The evidence is all in.\"\n\nTrump faces 34 felony charges related to falsifying business documents in an alleged attempt to cover up hush-money payments made to Daniels.\n\nJury deliberations may begin as early as Tuesday, following arguments from the defense and prosecution. Instructions for the jury were hashed out last week and Judge Juan Merchan said he delivered those instructions on Thursday.\n\nTrump's defense team leaned on witnesses from the Trump organization as well as Cohen's former attorney Robert Costello. They sought to combat Cohen's testimony with Costello's account of events in an attempt to discredit Trump's former attorney.\n\nCohen and Daniels testified for the prosecution.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of evidence, the day-long summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election.\n\nThe political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nMr Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ms Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered - including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit - were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true\".\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nHe told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nMr Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Ms Daniels 130,000 dollars (\u00a3101,000) to keep quiet.\n\nMr Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress.\n\nHe went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Mr Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nDefence lawyers say Mr Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hours-long address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Mr Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organisation for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staff were doing with the payments.\n\nHe disputed the contention that Trump and Ms Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Mr Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT\", used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time\", Mr Blanche labelled Mr Cohen the \"GLOAT\" - \"greatest liar of all time\".\n\nThe lawyer also called Mr Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt\".\n\nThat language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump.\n\nBut he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost, saying: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result.\"\n\nMr Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defence's assertion that Mr Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Mr Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nMr Cohen's actual call to Mr Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.\n\nMr Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Mr Cohen could have spoken to Mr Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Mr Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Mr Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.", "source": {"uri": "ludlowadvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_walton@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Gregory Walton", "type":

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of evidence, the day-long summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election.\n\nThe political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nMr Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ms Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered - including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit - were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true\".\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nHe told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nMr Steinglass also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Ms Daniels 130,000 dollars (\u00a3101,000) to keep quiet.\n\nMr Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress.\n\nHe went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Mr Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nDefence lawyers say Mr Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hours-long address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Mr Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organisation for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staff were doing with the payments.\n\nHe disputed the contention that Trump and Ms Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Mr Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT\", used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time\", Mr Blanche labelled Mr Cohen the \"GLOAT\" - \"greatest liar of all time\".\n\nThe lawyer also called Mr Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt\".\n\nThat language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump.\n\nBut he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost, saying: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result.\"\n\nMr Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defence's assertion that Mr Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Mr Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nMr Cohen's actual call to Mr Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.\n\nMr Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Mr Cohen could have spoken to Mr Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Mr Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Mr Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nGraphic testimony\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\nUnanimity required\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki",

Trump's accused of falsifying dozens of business records to conceal the payment to Daniels, part of a broader alleged scheme to influence the election with help from the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid.\n\nBlanche said that Daniels was assisted in her hush money talks by her agent Gina Rodriguez and her lawyer Keith Davidson, who arranged the deal.\n\n\"There are a group of people who wanted to take advantage and extort money from President Trump,\" Blanche said.\n\nNo 'Criminal Intent'\n\nTrump's lawyer also tried to raise doubts about the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump faces to conceal his payment to Michael Cohen, his former attorney who paid Daniels. They included vouchers that Cohen submitted, invoices that the Trump Organization prepared and checks that Trump signed. Blanche argued that the records failed to prove criminal intent by Trump.\n\nBlanche saved his most pointed vitriol for Cohen, who prosecutors used to provide the connective tissue between the records and Trump's criminal intent. Cohen, he said, was a serial liar who went from loving Trump to hating him, and then made millions of dollars on books and podcasts castigating his former boss.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is the human embodiment of reasonable doubt,\" Blanche said. \"Michael Cohen is the GLOAT - literally, the greatest liar of all time.\"\n\nBlanche said Cohen acted alone when he made the payment to Daniels, seeking to debunk his testimony that Trump authorized the deal at every step. Blanche told the jury that wasn't true, and suggested Cohen went rogue.\n\n\"If there's anything we've learned from this trial -- Michael Cohen does not take that oath seriously,\" Blanche said. \"He's lied repeatedly,\" the defense lawyer said, citing a litany of lies Cohen told to Congress, prosecutors, and most importantly, jurors at the Trump trial. \"He's like the MVP of liars.\"\n\nCohen, who was Bragg's star witness after going to prison for various crimes, spent days testifying about Trump's knowledge of the hush-money scheme.

It is, at least in part, a strategy in response to warnings that behaving like he has in past trials could backfire. (Justin Lane/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It\u00b4s unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Here\u00b4s what every key witness said at Donald Trump\u00b4s hush money trial\n\n- As Trump\u00b4s hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven\u00b4t proved Trump\u00b4s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump\u00b4s case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out - including professional line sitters with pup tents - for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump\u00b4s entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president\u00b4s guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks alongside his attorney Todd Blanche following the day's proceedings in his trial Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe trial featured allegations that Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments , including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Trump had sex a decade earlier. Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified the records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\n- Graphic testimony -\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nMore from this section Chaotic Memorial Day weekend at the Jersey Shore leads to stabbing, curfew Grayson Murray dies aged 30 just 24 hours after withdrawing from Charles Schwab Challenge Bronx Historical Society offers Mott Haven walking tour, screening of 'Up Jump The Boogie'\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur/cl/bfm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_walton@reformer.com", "name": "Gregory Walton", "type":

That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush-money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said.\n\nProsecutors will then seek to sum up their claim that Trump illegally falsified business documents to cover up the payment, which they say aimed to ensure Daniels would not go public with her claim she had a sexual encounter with the former president.\n\nThe closing arguments, which are set to last most of the day, come after nearly two dozen witnesses took the stand since late April in the historic case, the first criminal trial against a former president in US history.\n\nTrump, who has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of conducting a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" against him, remains the presumptive Republican nominee ahead of elections in November.\n\nIf found guilty, he faces up to four years in prison, although imprisonment is unlikely for a first-time felon convicted of such a crime.\n\nA conviction will not prevent Trump from trying to take back the White House from Democratic President Joe Biden in the November election and it would not prevent him from taking office if he won.\n\nBut a guilty verdict could affect Trump's chances in what is expected to be a tight race against Biden, with recent polls showing some Trump supporters would not cast a ballot for him if he is convicted of a felony crime.\n\nProsecutors have the burden of proving Trump is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", the level of certainty required by US law. They will make their closing arguments after the defence, as is standard in New York criminal trials.\n\n\"This is a dark day in America. We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought,\" Trump told reporters as he entered the courtroom on Tuesday. \"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day.\"\n\nThe case centres on a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has denied Daniels' claim she had a sexual encounter with him in 2006, and his lawyer, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments on Tuesday.\n\nThe defence has also attempted to discredit the prosecution's witnesses throughout the trial, including Cohen, whom they have sought to portray as a serial liar who has an axe to grind against his former boss.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges related to the hush money payments as well as for lying to the US Congress.\n\nAfter the closing arguments are delivered on Tuesday, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations.\n\nThere is no time limit on how long the jury takes to deliberate and a verdict might not come by the end of the week.\n\nTo reach a verdict, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it.

Daniels alleged she had an affair with Trump in 2006, which he has denied. The former president has pleaded not guilty to all charges and said the case against him is politically motivated.\n\nNewsweek sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Tuesday.\n\nRing said that Cohen, the chief prosecution witness, told the jury about a phone call with Trump about the Daniels payment that turned out to be a phone call to Trump's bodyguard about crank calls Cohen was getting from a teenager.\n\nCohen told the court that he spoke on the phone with Trump about the payment before sending the money to Daniels.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche then showed Cohen a text message exchange he had with Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller. In a text, Cohen asked Schiller: \"Who can I speak to about harassing calls to my phone and office?\"\n\nBlanche accused Cohen of inventing a conversation with Trump about Daniels that was, in reality, a conversation with Schiller about the prank phone calls.\n\n\"This is the call that you testified about on Tuesday that you had a conversation with President Trump,\" Blanche said, to which Cohen responded that \"part of it\" was about the harassment calls noted in the text message, saying, \"I knew that Keith was with Trump at the time.\"\n\nRing told Newsweek that the phone call was central to the prosecution's claim that Trump knew in advance that Cohen was to pay hush money to Daniels.\n\n\"Trump's team will hammer away at the fact Cohen claimed he told Trump about the Stormy Daniels payoff in the critical phone call that really turned out to be about a teenage crank caller,\" Ring said. \"That was perhaps the best part of the trial for Trump and gives him a lot to play with in closing arguments.\n\n\"We will be hearing a lot about Michael Cohen's lack of credibility, felony convictions, admitted lying under oath, and admitted theft of money from Trump's business.

The testimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. Expect the defense to attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand.\n\nBy MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump is \"innocent\" and did not break the law, a lawyer for the former president told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday as the landmark hush money trial moved closer to its conclusion.\n\nThe arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" said defense attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should \"leave you wanting.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.\n\nThe case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.\n\nWhen Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday.\n\nThe nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions -- \"Just pay it,\" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nDefense lawyers called two witnesses -- neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.\n\nOn cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.\n\nThough jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence -- and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it's unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Why can't the defense go last? Big advantage, very unfair. Witch hunt!\"\n\nThe arguments will give the attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury hearing the landmark case.\n\nAfter more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict him of all charges while defence attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.\n\nThe judge is expected to instruct the jury, probably on Wednesday, on the law around the case and what they need to take into account during deliberations.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.The case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.\n\nTrump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.When Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.Trump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services and say his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion.\n\nProsecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing a seperate deal involving Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.The three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

Referring to how crucial the testimony of Michael Cohen is to the prosecution's case, Blanche called him \"the MVP of liars,\" pointing out Cohen's track record of perjury and argued that Cohen lied repeatedly in this trial as well.\n\n\"You cannot send someone to prison based on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche declared, drawing a rebuke from Judge Juan Merchan:\n\nJustice Juan Merchan told jurors to ignore an earlier comment from Donald Trump lawyer Todd Blanche that suggested the former president could be sent to prison if convicted.\n\nBlanche's statement \"was improper and you must disregard it,\" the judge said, noting jurors are not allowed to take punishment into consideration when deliberating.\n\nBlanche remained undeterred from his all-out assault on Cohen's credibility:\n\nInside the courthouse, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told the jury of seven men and five women that Trump's longtime lawyer-turned-star-prosecution-witness Michael Cohen was \"the GLOAT. He's the greatest liar of all time.\"\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars,\" Blanche said in his closing statement. \"He's the human embodiment of reasonable doubt, literally.\" ...\n\nDuring Blanche's sprawling three-and-a-half hours of closing arguments he repeatedly attempted to drive home that Cohen was too untrustworthy and had lied too many times -- including directly to the jurors -- for them to convict Trump on his word.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depends on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" he told the seven men and five women on the panel of Cohen.\n\nGiven that Cohen is the only witness that attested to any cover-up intent on Trump's behalf that related to the campaign, Blanche is entirely correct. Prosecutors have no other evidence of that intent other than Cohen's testimony. That only works if Cohen's credibility remained strong enough to dispel reasonable doubt, but that's clearly not what happened in the trial. Not only did Blanche catch Cohen in significant lies and misrepresentations during cross-examination, he also forced Cohen to confess embezzlement from Trump -- giving a pretty good motive for why Cohen would lie on the stand in this case.\n\nPlus, jurors have to ask themselves why prosecutors essentially immunized Cohen for that felony to push a much-less serious case against Trump.\n\nCohen was not Blanche's sole target. He also raked the prosecution over the coals for dragging in irrelevant issues such as the Access Hollywood tape and Sunny Daniels herself, who didn't have anything to do with the ledger entries or the technical crimes of which Trump was accused. \"They did it to try to embarrass President Trump,\" Blanche argued. Judge Merchan probably wouldn't allow Blanche to explicitly argue that the case was cooked up for political reasons, but Blanche made it clear with the subtext of that argument.\n\nBlanche took direct aim at another point I have argued since last week -- that Cohen's testimony actually disproves the case against Trump. The indictment accuses Trump of falsifying the ledger entries of payments to Cohen as retainer payments rather than reimbursements for the payment to Daniels. However, Blanche reminded jurors that Cohen himself testified to doing a significant amount of legal work for the Trumps while receiving those $35,000 a month retainer payments -- doing more such legal work than Cohen provided for other clients paying him higher retainer fees at the time:\n\nCohen, Trump's former lawyer, told jurors that Trump ordered him to make the payment to silence Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the former president. The records in question stem from Trump's alleged role in reimbursing Cohen for that payment. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBlanche told jurors on Tuesday that Cohen, who was Trump's personal attorney at the time, was paid in 2017 for legal work, governed by an oral retainer agreement. That work was booked as a legal expense because Cohen was a lawyer. The payments to Cohen were also fully disclosed as the law required, Blanche said.\n\n\"How can it be there is any intent to defraud by President Trump when he discloses it to the IRS, he tweets about it, and he submits it on his ethics forms?\" Blanche said of the payments.\n\nHow can there be any fraud at all if Cohen did legal work for Trump while only getting the monthly retainer fee as compensation? Again, go back to that point in the testimony, where Cohen admits that he did a substantial amount of legal work for Trump and his family while consistently promoting his status as \"personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump.\" That makes it clear that the purpose of the payments was to compensate Cohen for his legal work.\n\nIn fact, as Cohen also admitted under cross-examination, he relished his status as Trump's personal attorney. He didn't turn on Trump until after Trump chose Rudy Giuliani as his personal attorney in the Mueller probe, at which point Cohen grew angry at being left out.\n\nThe New York Times didn't miss an opportunity to miss the point, by the way, proclaiming this part of the argument \"perplexing\":\n\nMr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, repeatedly accused Mr. Cohen of telling \"lies\" on the stand during his closing argument, saying there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that Mr. Trump had plotted to falsify records. He also argued that there was nothing false about the documents because Mr. Cohen had in fact performed legal work -- and suggested that Mr. Trump had little reason to pay attention to them in any case, because he was the \"leader of the free world\" at the time.\n\nBut Mr. Blanche's argument was at times perplexing. He sometimes called extra attention to elements of the prosecution's case and repeatedly emphasized Mr. Cohen's position as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer even as he was impugning his character.\n\nWell, how much more clear can this be? If Cohen performed legal work for Trump without any other compensation than the $35,000 per month he received, then those payments were entered properly in the ledger as legal fees. And if that's the case, then there is no crime at all.\n\nIsn't that what defense attorneys are expected to do -- show that the government doesn't have a case, especially in one this cooked up by Alvin Bragg? One has to be deliberately obtuse to miss the import of Cohen's cross-examination on those points.\n\nIn fact, we can expect a lot of narrative-building over the next few days based on deliberate obtuseness such as this. The Protection Racket Media will have expend lots of effort into being \"perplexed\" about the defense arguments, and even more so if the jury finds enough reasonable doubt to acquit.\n\nThat's why we need independent voices more than ever in America.\n\nMany of our readers have joined the fight as part of our VIP and VIP Gold membership, and they have been crucial to our operations as an independent platform and the ability to debate all of the issues honestly.

He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of evidence, the day-long summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election.\n\nThe political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nMr Steinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility.\n\nHe acknowledged that Ms Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered - including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit - were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear.

It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Mr Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nIt is unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Mr Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nDefence lawyers say Mr Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hours-long address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Mr Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Mr Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organisation for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staff were doing with the payments.\n\nHe disputed the contention that Trump and Ms Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Mr Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT\", used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time\", Mr Blanche labelled Mr Cohen the \"GLOAT\" - \"greatest liar of all time\".\n\nThe lawyer also called Mr Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt\".\n\nThat language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal wellbeing depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Mr Blanche said.\n\nThe lawyer's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr Blanche sought to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24 2016.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting hold of Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump.\n\nBut he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost, saying: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result.\"\n\nMr Steinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defence's assertion that Mr Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Mr Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nMr Cohen's actual call to Mr Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records.\n\nMr Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Mr Cohen could have spoken to Mr Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Mr Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Mr Biden.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Then, she stood behind Trump as he once again railed against the prosecution.\n\nShe was seated inside the courtroom on the aisle next to Eric's wife Lara Trump, who is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her husband husband Michael Boulos was also there for closing arguments in the Stormy Daniels trial.\n\nTiffany, a Georgetown Law graduate, is getting the chance to see Trump lawyer Todd Blanche weave together closing arguments that were set to last about two and a half hours. It is a critical aspect of trial law, referencing evidence and testimony jurors may have heard weeks ago to try to steer them toward a verdict of not guilty.\n\nJust days ago, Blanche had asked star witness Michael Cohen during cross examination about the apparent 'extortion' attempt involving Tiffany.\n\nTiffany Trump (c) attended closing arguments in her father Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday. She was joined in court by Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and Lara Trump\n\nIt was part of an effort to undercut Cohen's own testimony that he was speaking to Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter during a critical period, rather than other matters that might have risen to the top of his to-do list.\n\n'You agree with me, right, that you had a lot going on both in your personal life and with President Trump in those first two weeks of October?' Blanche asked the witness during a long cross examination where he poked holes in his story.\n\n'You recall on October 25th, you recall her communicating with you concerns about somebody trying to blackmail her?' Blanche asked. 'Yes sir,' Cohen responded.\n\nThat was the day after Cohen testified that he spoke to Trump to tell him the Stormy Daniels matter was resolved and said Trump authorized the plan to pay her

him of lying about ever discussing the Stormy Daniels pay off during the call.\n\nTiffany has kept a lower profile than her older siblings, whose mother is the late Ivana Trump.\n\nShe appeared with him at the 2016 Republican convention, but didn't join him at the White House like Ivanka did, and was at school during the period when Eric and Don Jr. were helming the Trump Organization along with

The charges he faced back then pertained to lies he said he made to try to shield Trump. But he turned into a key witness for prosecutors and other officials pursuing the former president after his conviction, offering to cooperate with them.\n\nBlanche also urged the jury to leave their other opinions of the Manhattan real estate mogul and former president at the door.\n\n\"This isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump,\" Blanche told jurors, or of their voting plans later this year. \"If you focus just on that evicence you heard in this courtroom, this is a very, very quick and easy not guilty verdict.\"\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass, meanwhile, portrayed the alleged cover-up of Trump's alleged past relations with Daniels as a crucial component of his last-minute campaigning in 2016.\n\n\"This scheme, cooked up by these men at this time, could very well be what got President Trump elected,\" Steinglass argued.\n\nHe uged the jury to \"tune out the noise and ignore the sideshows.\"\n\n\"If you've done that, you'll see that the people have presented powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass portrayed the \"conspiracy\" as an attempt to avoid Daniels' \"messy\" and \"uncomfortable\" story reaching voters' ears in the run-up to the vote.\n\nTrump, who is seeking a second term in the White House in this November's election, is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nMost notably these include Cohen allegedly attempting to conceal the purpose of a $130,000 payment made to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels said the money was given to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she had with the Republican in 2006. Trump contends that it was a payment to silence her \"false and extortionist accusations.\"\n\nCohen made the $130,000 payment out of his own pocket but the accusations are focused on how Trump's real estate company falsely logged the reimbursements to Cohen in its financial records and whether Trump had full knowledge of the scheme.\n\nThe prosecution argues as the pay-off was made to keep the public from learning about the alleged sexual encounter ahead of the election, alleging that covering up the payments' purpose amounted to illegal campaign financing.\n\nThe defense argues that any errors describing the payments were made without Trump's knowledge, claiming that he was often preoccuopied by more important issues as president.\n\nThe jury will retire for deliberations after the prosecution's closing presentation with a verdict considered possible or even likely this week.\n\nThe charges can carry a prison sentence of up to four years, but it would be Trump's first felony conviction and the maximum sentence is not considered likely.\n\nEven if the event of a conviction, US laws do not prevent a convicted felon from running for the presidency.\n\nTrump, who attended the proceedings, told reporters before entering the court that it was a \"very dangerous day for America,\" calling the proceedings \"a rigged court case that should never have been brought.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign staffers and his children held their own news conference outside the courtroom, only for Joe Biden's campaign more unusually to send a delegation to the site as well.\n\nHollywood actor Robert de Niro and two police officers involved in defending Congress amid the January 6, 2021 attack spoke to reporters near the court. De Niro called Trump a \"clown\" and a \"tyrant,\" and warned of his reelection bid: \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\nNevertheless, Biden's campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters their presence was not designed to draw attention to the trial, instead claiming it was a reaction to that attention.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there. We're here today because you are all here,\" he said.\n\nIt's one of several criminal cases the former president faces, though this may also prove to be the only one that concludes before November 5's election.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/69208464_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 4781, "textEnd": 4791}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"},

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified business records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump, 77, is already the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election in which he lost to Biden.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur-sms/bfm", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_walton@ktbs.com", "name": "Gregory Walton", "type": "author", "isAgency":

He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Arizona election indictment Civil cases\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

How could there be, he asked, when Trump freely and repeatedly admitted to reimbursing Cohen?\n\nBlanche then showed the jury three exhibits from the prosecution's own case.\n\nEach exhibit -- showing a tax form, a tweet, and a government ethics form -- was shown on the courtroom's display screens.\n\nEach bolsters the prosecution's case: that Trump knew full well that the $130,000 he paid Cohen in installments throughout 2017 was for reimbursement, not legal fees as his business-record entries falsely claimed.\n\n\"The government has to prove to you that President Trump caused these entries -- even if they were false -- with an intent to defraud,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\n\"Where is the intent to defraud on the part of President Trump?\" the lawyer asked the jury.\n\nProsecutors must demonstrate Trump had an intent to defraud in order to prove first-degree falsifying business records, the state charge that Trump allegedly violated 34 times throughout 2017, including when he personally signed nine of Cohen's reimbursement checks.\n\nAt another point in Blanche's summations, he earned the anger of the judge by telling jurors \"You cannot send somebody to prison based on what Michael Cohen is saying.\" Jurors are supposed to weigh only the facts in their deliberations -- not the potential punishment.\n\n\"That was outrageous, Mr. Blanche,\" state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan told Blanche after jurors were dismissed for lunch.\n\n\"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have, and a defense lawyer as long as you have, knows it's highly inappropriate,\" the judge said.\n\n\"It's simply not allowed. Period,\" the judge added. He gave a curative instruction to the jury, explaining that Blanche's comment was \"improper\" and that if Trump is convicted, \"a prison sentence is not required.\" Falsifying business records carries a sentence of anywhere from zero jail to four years prison.\n\nHere are the three exhibits that Blanche displayed in court for jurors as \"proof\" that Trump had nothing to hide and therefore could not have intended to defraud anyone.\n\nThe Trump Organization -- and Trump as an individual -- reported that they'd paid Michael Cohen a total of $420,000 in 2017.\n\nProsecutors say this is the sum Trump's then CFO, Allen Weisselberg, calculated for what Cohen would be paid as reimbursement for his hush-money outlay, plus taxes and other money Trump owed him.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Trump posted a somewhat garbled tweet that concedes the payments he'd made to Cohen throughout 2017 were, in his word, \"reimbursement.\"\n\nThis tweet was made just five months after signing the last of nine $35,000 checks to Cohen.

Jurors will then undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThey'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics.\n\nTheir task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nAny verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nThe indictment against Trump centers on payoffs allegedly made to two women, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nTrump's former lawyer and \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 and arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000.\n\nTrump's company, the Trump Organization, then reimbursed Cohen and paid him bonuses and extra payments - all of which, prosecutors say, were falsely logged as legal expenses in company records. Over several months, Cohen said the company paid him $420,000.\n\nPayments were also allegedly made to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged Trump had out of wedlock.\n\nThe indictment, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, made Trump the first ex-president ever to face criminal charges.\n\nTrump has denied the accusations.\n\nAfter being forced to release a seated juror, the judge ordered the media not to report on where potential jurors have worked - even when stated in open court - and to be careful about revealing information about those who would sit in judgment of the former president. Here's what we can report.\n\nJuror 1 and foreperson: A man who lives in New York City and has no children. Loves the outdoors and gets his news from The New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\n\nJuror 2: A man who said he follows Trump's former lawyer, Cohen, on \"X,\" formerly known as Twitter. He also revealed he follows other right-wing accounts including Trump's former adviser, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nHe has said he would unfollow Cohen as he may be a witness in the trial.\n\nJuror 3: A middle-aged man who lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times and Google.\n\nJuror 4: A man who lived in New York City for 15 years. He is originally from California. He is married with three children and a wife who is a teacher. He has served on a jury before - both on a grand jury and a jury in a criminal trial.\n\nThe juror said he gets his news from \"a smattering\" of sources and does not use social media.\n\nJuror 6: A young woman who lives in Manhattan and likes to dance.\n\nJuror 7: A man who is married with two children.\n\nHe gets most of his news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and The Washington Post. The man has said he is aware there are other lawsuits but said, \"I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"\n\nJuror 8: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 9: A woman who lives in Manhattan. She is not married and has no children.\n\nShe has never served on a jury before and does not watch the news. However, she said she does have email subscriptions to CNN and The New York Times. She follows social media accounts and listens to podcasts. She also enjoys watching reality TV.\n\nJuror 10: A man who lives in Manhattan. He is not married and has no children. He does have a roommate who works in accounting. He rarely follows the news but he does listen to podcasts on behavioral psychology.\n\nJuror 11: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nJuror 12: No information has been released about this juror.\n\nThe trial is not being televised. Instead, news reporters and producers will have the ability to sit inside the courtroom and deliver information to the public.\n\nAs of this report, Trump is currently involved in four criminal cases, which includes the hush money case.\n\nA second case out of Fulton County, Georgia, has charged Trump, as well as 18 others, with participating in a scheme to illegally attempt to overturn the former president's loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump is also involved in a third criminal case in Washington, D.C., which charged him with allegedly conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAnd his fourth case involves classified documents that Trump illegally retained at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [],

He spent just over 13 months in jail.\n\nThe closing arguments are the last opportunity to influence the opinion of the jurors. The jury will retire for deliberations after the prosecution's closing presentation. A verdict was expected later Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nTrump, who is seeking the White House again in this November's election, is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme involving Cohen to conceal a $130,000 pay-off made to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels said the money was given to keep her quiet about an affair she had with the Republican in 2006. He has admitted to paying her on the eve of the 2016 election to stop her \"false and extortionist accusations\" but denies any sexual encounter.\n\nAt the trial, Cohen testified over the course of several days that he worked at Trump's direction to orchestrate the payments to buy the silence of Daniels.\n\nCohen made the $130,000 payment out of his own pocket. At the crux of the case is how Trump's real estate company falsely logged the reimbursements to Cohen in its financial records and whether Trump had full knowledge of the scheme.\n\nCrucially, the prosecution argues that because the pay-off was made to keep the public from learning about the alleged sexual encounter ahead of the election, the cover-up involving the financial records amounted to illegal campaign financing.

Hush Money Trial Verdict Not So Simple: 5 Possible Outcomes By Benzinga", "body": "One of the most watched trials in the United States in 2024 is nearing an end, with closing arguments coming this week in a federal case alleging former President Donald Trump falsified business records.\n\nHere's the latest on the trial and the possible outcomes the jury can decide.\n\nWhat Happened: Jury selection for Trump's hush money trial alleging falsified business records began on April 15. After multiple weeks of jury selection and witness testimony, both sides have rested.\n\nOn Tuesday, the trial resumes, with the judge issuing instructions to the jury and closing arguments set to begin in the trial. Once the trial is handed over to the jury, the trial could continue for hours or weeks, depending on how they view the evidence.\n\nThe 12 members of the jury could decide the fate of Trump in the trial, with multiple outcomes, all requiring unanimous agreement. Several other outcomes could also be reached in the trial, reported Politico.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts related to falsified business records. The prosecution alleges records were falsified in connection to a hush money payment made by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to adult actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn a guilty verdict, Judge Juan Merchan would determine the sentencing for Trump, with up to four years in prison for each guilty count.\n\nA hung jury could be one of the most talked about outcomes for the trial. This result happens if the 12 jurors cannot reach a unanimous decision. Politico highlighted several cases involving Trump allies or similar in nature to Trump's, which have resulted in hung jury verdicts.\n\nFailure to reach a verdict by the jury could lead to Judge Merchan declaring a mistrial in the case.\n\nThe prosecution could choose to retry the criminal trial against Trump in the event of a hung jury and mistrial.\n\nThe directed verdict is the most unlikely for Trump's trial, but remains a possibility, Politico said. In this scenario, Merchan would remove the jury from the case and acquit Trump on the charges. This ruling would come if the judge determines that the prosecution failed to prove their case. Trump's defense team has repeatedly requested the case to be dismissed, but Merchan has consistently declined to do so.\n\nRelated Link: Trump Hush Money Trial Has 12 Jurors: Here Are The 7 Men, 5 Women To Decide Former President's Fate\n\nWhat's Next: On Tuesday, Merchan instructed the jury, informing them that they would hear closing arguments before making their decisions, based on the testimony and evidence already presented in the case.\n\n\"You are the finders of fact, and it is for you and for you alone to determine the facts from the evidence,\" Merchan said, as reported by NBC News. \"You and you alone are the judges of the facts in the case.\"\n\nClosing arguments could take six to seven hours for the defense and prosecution, according to estimates shared with NBC.\n\nTrump layer Todd Blanche used the opening of his closing argument to discuss the nature of the case.\n\n\"This case is about documents, it's a paper case,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche told the jury that \"President Trump is innocent\" and the trial proved that.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district has not met their burden of proof. Period.\"\n\nBlanche also pointed to key prosecution witness and former Trump lawyer Cohen being a liar and his testimony being untrustworthy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign team is expected to hold a news conference outside the court Tuesday and is said to be closely monitoring the outcome of the trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump spoke briefly to the media ahead of the trial. The former president said the trial is \"election hunting\" and \"election interfering.\"\n\n\"This is not a trial that should happen. It's a very sad day. This is a dark day in America,\" Trump said.\n\nAs previously shared by Benzinga, a guilty verdict does not rule out Trump running for president. Trump is also set to maintain control of his media company Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) if he ends up in prison.\n\nDJT Price Action: Trump Media & Technology shares are up 5.1% to $48.17 on Tuesday. Shares of Trump's media company have been highly volatile during his criminal proceedings.\n\nRead Next: Trump Vs.

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump engaged in \"a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday in the former president's hush money trial, while a defense lawyer branded the star witness as the \"greatest liar of all time\" and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal.\n\nThe lawyers' dueling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility and the strength of evidence, offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury before it starts deliberating the first felony case against a former American president.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

If Trump did falsify documents, he didn't do it with the required criminal intent, Blanche argued. He then showed jurors 3 prosecution exhibits where Trump admits to the hush-money reimbursement.\n\nIt's the classic defense closing argument: My client didn't do it, ladies and gentlemen -- but if he did do it, it wasn't intentional.\n\nThis is the argument that Donald Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, tried out on the hush-money jury in Manhattan on Tuesday.\n\nYes, Blanche spent the bulk of his argument denying that Trump committed the charges he's on trial for\n\nProsecutors say Trump falsified 34 business records to hide a year's worth of reimbursement payments to his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, who had fronted a $130,000 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump was not involved with any such conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, Blanche told jurors in great detail on Tuesday, during a three-hour summation.\n\nBut if he was, there was no requisite intent, Blanche argued. How could there be, he asked, when Trump freely admitted to reimbursing Cohen?\n\nBlanche then showed the jury three exhibits from the prosecution's own case.\n\nEach exhibit -- showing a tax form, a tweet, and a government ethics form -- was shown on the courtroom's display screens.\n\nEach bolsters the prosecution's case: that Trump knew full well that the $130,000 he paid Cohen in installments throughout 2017 was for reimbursement, not legal fees as his business- record entries falsely claimed.\n\n\"The government has to prove to you that President Trump caused these entries -- even if they were false -- with an intent to defraud,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\n\"Where is the intent to defraud on the part of President Trump?\" the lawyer asked the jury.\n\nProsecutors must demonstrate Trump had an intent to defraud in order to prove first-degree falsifying business records, the state charge that Trump allegedly violated 34 times throughout 2017, including when he personally signed nine of Cohen's reimbursement checks.\n\nHere are the three exhibits that Blanche displayed in court for jurors as \"proof\" that Trump had nothing to hide.\n\n1. A 1099 tax form from 2017\n\nThe Trump Organization -- and Trump as an individual -- reported that they'd paid Michael Cohen a total of $420,000 in 2017.\n\nProsecutors say this is the sum Trump's then CFO, Allen Weisselberg, calculated for what Cohen would be paid as reimbursement for his hush-money outlay, plus taxes and other money Trump owed him.\n\nWhy would Trump announce these payments to the IRS \"if there was some deep-rooted intent to defraud on the part of President Trump?\" Blanche asked jurors.\n\nFoto: Manhattan district attorney's office/BI\n\nFoto: Manhattan district attorney's office/BI\n\n2. A 2018 tweet\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Trump posted a somewhat garbled tweet that concedes the payments he'd made to Cohen throughout 2017 were, in his word, \"reimbursement.\"\n\nAn incriminating tweet Foto: Manhattan district attorney's office/BI\n\nThis tweet was made just five months after signing the last of nine $35,000 checks to Cohen. Each check was labeled \"RETAINER.\"\n\n3. A government ethics form\n\nAlso during closing arguments, Blanche showed jurors what's called an \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report\" for the year 2017. This was the then-president's mandatory disclosure of his assets and liabilities .\n\nUnder \"Liablities\" -- which is the section where Trump must list the money he's borrowed -- Trump certified that in 2017, he \"fully reimbursed\" Cohen an interest-free sum of between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\n\"President Trump tweeted what happened when it came out,\" and then signed a government ethics form that also admitted to the reimbursement, Blanche told jurors Tuesday.\n\n\"That's not evidence of any intent to defraud,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe defense lawyer spent most of his summation impugning the credibility of Cohen, whose testimony is key to the prosecution case.\n\nCohen is \"literally like an MVP of liars,\" Blanche told jurors. Two jurors -- a woman in the front row and a man in the back row, smiled when Blanche went on to call Cohen \"The 'Gloat'\" -- for Greatest Liar of All Time.\"\n\nDeliberations are expected to begin on Wednesday.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_italiano@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Laura Italiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intention (criminal law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Ethics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Ethics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6655d1f520abc1efe8fde4a1.jpg?ver=1716919325", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-03", "textStart": 2849, "textEnd": 2860}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hours-long recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Period.\"\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche delivered closing arguments Tuesday after a six-week-long historic and unprecedented criminal trial of a former President of the United States.\n\nTrump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified records to conceal a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic performer, in the lead-up to the 2016 election to silence her about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006. The former president has maintained his innocence.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: CLOSING ARGUMENTS TO BEGIN AS MERCHAN SKIRTS DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n\"Each of you will decide at the end of this case whether President Trump is guilty or not guilty,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes. The district attorney did not meet the burden of proof,\" Blanche said. \"Period.\"\n\nBlanche added that the case is \"simple,\" and it is \"not a guilty verdict.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents -- it is a paper case,\" Blanche explained. \"This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago. It is not even about a nondisclosure agreement signed eight years ago.\"\n\nBlanche explained that the charges are about whether Trump \"had anything\" to do with payments to his ex-attorney Michael Cohen on his personal accounting ledger.\n\n\"The answer? The bookings were accurate and there was no intent to defraud and there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election,\" Blanche said. \"The proof doesn't add up.\"\n\nBlanche told the jury that they cannot convict Trump based on Cohen's testimony, recalling that Trump's ex-attorney \"took the stand and then lied.\"\n\n\"The records are not false and there was no intent to defraud,\" he said.\n\nBlanche explained that not one single invoice was sent to Trump directly, and explained that Cohen billed Trump \"for services rendered.\" Blanche reminded the jury that Cohen did render services as Trump's personal attorney in 2017.\n\nBlanche explained that even if the amount of work was minimal, there was a retainer agreement, which he explained is \"how retainer agreements work.\" Blanche said Cohen was \"on call for President Trump.\"\n\nBlanche also explained that checks to Cohen were not signed by Trump.\n\n\"You can't convict President Trump,\" Blanche said. \"Because sometimes President Trump looked at the invoices...that is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt.\"\n\nBlanche said Cohen asked the jury to \"ignore\" documents and believe he was willing to work for free.\n\n\"Do you even believe that for a second?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen testified that he was \"reimbursed $420,000\" for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels. Cohen said former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg suggested he \"gross up\" the payments and that Trump knew the details of the reimbursement.\n\nThe prosecution presented Cohen with 11 checks totaling $420,000. Cohen confirmed that they were all received and deposited. The checks had a description of a \"retainer,\" which Cohen said was false.\n\nBlanche said that the idea Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000 when he only owed him $130,000 is \"absurd.\" Blanche said there is no proof to \"grossing it up\" and no evidence of a tax treatment.\n\nBlanche went on to discuss that the prosecution has to prove that Trump \"caused\" these entries with the purpose and intent to defraud, but asked the jury: \"Where is the intent to defraud?\"\n\nNY V. TRUMP: HOUSE GOP LAWMAKER URGES MERCHAN TO DISMISS CASE OVER 'FATAL FLAWS,' REFER TO FEC\n\nBlanche says there is a tax form -- a 1099 -- to reflect the payments from a Trump personal account to Cohen.\n\n\"There is nothing false or misleading about 1099,\" he said. \"If there was a deep-rooted intent to defraud, why was it reported to IRS as exactly what it was?\"\n\nAs for the alleged \"catch and kill\" scheme with the National Enquirer, Blanche again maintained that the arrangements were \"perfectly legal,\" and an arrangement American Media Inc., the company that owns the publication, had been practicing for decades.\n\n\"There is nothing criminal about Trump wanting positive news stories. But the idea that positive stories in National Enquirer could influence 2016 election is 'preposterous,'\" Blanche said.\n\nEX-TOP BIDEN DOJ OFFICIAL NOW PROSECUTING TRUMP WAS ONCE PAID BY DNC FOR 'POLITICAL CONSULTING'\n\nBut Blanche did say David Pecker, the AMI CEO, admitted that he had \"never heard\" the term \"catch and kill.\"\n\n\"That's meaningful,\" Blanche said.\n\nAs for Cohen, Blanche said that \"he is the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly...he is biased and motivated,\" Blanche said, adding that the jury should want a witness to tell the truth.\n\n\"Michael Cohen is the GLOAT,\" Blanche said. \"He is the greatest liar of all time...his words cannot be trusted...all those lies put them to the side for just a moment, that is enough to walk away.\"\n\nBlanche reminded that Cohen lied to both Houses of Congress, federal judges, state judges and family.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"You cannot send someone to prison based upon the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, adding that a verdict needs to be reached based on evidence from documents and witnesses. \"If you do that, this is a very quick and easy not

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified business records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump, 77, is already the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election in which he lost to Biden.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nMore from this section Paying tribute: Westport Boy Scouts place flags at the graves of veterans Brazil's new Petrobras chief calls to speed up oil exploration Pleasant conditions continue Sunday on NYC; storms move in on Memorial Day\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White House.\n\nbur-sms/bfm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_walton@reformer.com", "name": "Gregory Walton", "type":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8 News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This is a high profile case and it's charitable to say that his closing argument is not exactly going to make Johnny Cochran look on from the afterlife and say, \"Wow.\" This was not a wowing closing argument, in fact it was surprisingly bland and desperate. The part I particularly enjoyed was him saying that the bookkeeper for Trump testified that she \"usually\" stapled the invoices to the bills which were sent for Trump to sign. He made particular note of the fact that she specifically did not recall whether she stapled the invoices in question regarding the hush money payments labeled as legal expenses but that was her usual practice. In other words, Blanche is hoping for one juror to conclude that \"we can't convict because we don't know for sure if the invoice was stapled to the bill.\" That strikes me as a desperate reach.\n\nAnd then Todd Blanche truly crossed the line and was reprimanded for it. It's carved in stone that you don't talk to a jury about punishments or sentencing or anything like that in a closing argument. But Blanche, ostensibly a pro, did just that thing. Maybe Trump strong armed him to do so.\n\nAnd when the court reconvened after lunch, Judge Merchan did precisely that.\n\n\"I think that was outrageous, Mr Blanche,\" Merchan said. \"Someone who has been a prosecutor as long as you should know. It's hard for me to imagine how that was accidental in any way.\"\n\nFollowing a lunch break, the judge addressed the comment directly with the jury.\n\n\"That comment is improper, and you must disregard it,\" Merchan said.\n\nThis is a lame closing argument and the defense lawyer shot himself shot himself and his client in the foot.\n\nBlanche said that the prosecution using quotes from Trump's old books about his business practices should make the jury \"suspicious\" about their case because that is weak evidence. He said that in the Trump Org accounting system Tarasoff entered them as \"legal expense,\" which is more proof of what they were for. He also noted that the invoices were paid out of the trust being managed by Junior and Eric since Trump was president but when they realized that Cohen was Trump's personal attorney they switched his payments to Trump's personal account after three months.\n\nBlanche then argued that when Trump signed the checks to Cohen he was very busy in the White House as president so may not have read or looked at the checks or invoices before signing them. He said that Trump's assistant in the White House Westerhout testified that he was sometimes presented many checks in a stack to sign so he may have just quickly went through them without looking at them.\n\nBlanche then argued that the prosecution could have called CFO Allen Weisselberg as a witness to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses but chose not to. He also said the fact that Weisselberg/Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000 as reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy was \"absurd\" because there is no way they would pay him triple what he was owed since Trump paid close attention to his finances. (This seemed to contradict his earlier argument that Trump was just signing checks blindly).\n\nWhich is it, is Trump the micromanaging wizard, with a handle on all that happens in his world, nary a sparrow falls to the ground that he does not know about it, or does he just autograph anything that's put in front of him? Now here's where Blanche went \"out into the weeds\" to quote Jake Tapper.\n\nBlanche then made a novel argument - that if Trump's Comptroller McConney, Weisselberg, or Trump himself thought that anything they were doing was illegal, why would they have preserved all the documents and not destroyed them? He also argued that they would not have reported the payments to the IRS to leave another paper trail.\n\nBlanche then shifted gears to argue that the \"catch-and-kill\" scheme with AMI and the Enquirer is not illegal because celebrities pay tabloids to kill stories all the time. He also argued that every political campaign tries to work the press to run positive stories on their candidate and negative stories on their opponents so there is nothing unusual or criminal about that. He noted that Pecker testified that the first story he killed for Trump was way back in 1988, long before he entered politics. He then argued that the Enquirer didn't have much influence on elections anyway and Trump knew that.\n\nBlanche then addressed the Karen McDougal story. He said that she didn't want the story published at all anyway, which is why she sold it to Pecker. He argued that Trump wasn't responsible for killing that story since that is what she wanted to happen to benefit herself not help Trump. He also argued that Pecker has less credibility as a witness because he was given immunity by the prosecution for his cooperation.\n\nBlanche said that Cohen's story about the recording he made of his conversation with Trump in 2017 made no sense because he said the purpose of the recording was to play it for Pecker, but then he never did that and gave no explanation why. He said that Cohen testified that Trump assistant Rhona Graff was in an out of that meeting but she was never asked if she remembered it by the prosecution. He then argued that the recording of the call cuts off when Trump says the word \"check\" and he might have been about to say \"check with my people.\"\n\nThis is the pattern, here. Blanche is out in the woods extemporizing on theories and opinions and what ifs. It's not a solid closing argument. A solid closing argument is, \"you have seen\" and then a description of rock solid evidence that was presented. A solid closing argument is when you can give a plausible version of what really happened, using the evidence the defense has presented. This is all rambling and speculation. But I don't blame Blanche, you do what you can with what you have to work with, always.\n\nThe argument then switched to the Stormy Daniels allegations. Blanche said that her story had already been published by a small publication in 2011 so it was already out there. He argued that Cohen wanted to pay off Stormy himself without telling Trump about it so he could later \"take credit\" for it with Trump. He then argued that the deal was negotiated between Davidson and Dylan Howard with AMI and that Trump was not part of the negotiations. He cited other deals they did together that he said were done to extort people and had nothing to do with politics - the Hulk Hogan sex tape story was one example.\n\nBlanche then argued that Stormy later profited off the story despite the original payoff by doing a book, a documentary, and selling products, and this showed that her intent was just to extort Trump for her own benefit.\n\nHe then gave a strange argument about the Access Hollywood tape. He said that was a very stressful time for Trump and his family because of what was revealed to the public, but it was not the \"Doomsday event\" as suggested by Cohen and the prosecution. He said that Daniels wasn't called to testify to the grand jury because her testimony wasn't necessary to this case, but they called her during the trial solely to embarrass Trump to the public.\n\nBlanche then took a scattershot approach to discrediting Cohen. He first argued that Cohen wanted a job in the White House but knew that he had no chance of getting one. He then noted that Trump himself never signed the NDAs with McDougal or Daniels, which he argued made no sense because it could never be enforced if Trump wasn't a party. Then he said the White House call logs show that his call went to Trump's bodyguard Schiller instead of Trump, so how do they know he really spoke to Trump. He said that Cohen was dealing with a 14 year old that was prank calling him at the time, so the call could've been to talk to Schiller about that.\n\nBlanche then noted all the various things Cohen admitted lying about, calling him \"the MVP of liars.\" He played clips from Cohen's podcast to show how biased he is towards Trump, giving him a motive to lie. He then talked about how much money Cohen made off his two books and his podcast, and all of that was entirely based on Trump.\n\nIt's not disputed that everybody in this case is making money off of Donald Trump. He's a freak show. That's why people are making money off him. It's the very nature of the grotesque that you cannot look away and we've all been riveted to this spectacle for nine years now.\n\nHere is Meidas Touch's summation of Blanche's key points. This is what the prosecution will do a final refutation of when they give their closing argument.\n\n1. Cohen created the invoices to be billed for legal services.\n\n2. No proof Trump saw the vouchers or knew what he was signing.\n\n3. The fact that Trump reported payments to the IRS and on his government ethics form showed he had no intend to defraud.\n\n4. There was no evidence that any of this was done with the intent to influence the election.\n\n5. There is nothing illegal about paying to kill a story and celebrities do it all the time.\n\n6. AMI would have run the \"love child\" story if it was true, which is inconsistent with the theory that they only wanted to help Trump.\n\n7. McDougal never wanted her story published so there was no need for anyone to catch and kill it.\n\n8. Stormy Daniels story had already been made public in a small publication in 2011.\n\n9. Some of the testimony didn't line up with the documents and exhibits entered and parts of the story were intentionally omitted from the prosecution's case, such as the harassing texts from the 14 year old to Cohen.\n\n10. Cohen is a habitual liar and is biased against Trump because he hates him. He called him the GLOAT - \"Greatest Liar Of All-Time.\"\n\nNo, Mr. Blanche, that title does not belong to Michael Cohen. That title belongs to your client. He, along with Satan, is the Father Of All Lies.\n\nWe'll have updates and other posts as this moves along.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invoice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invoice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookkeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afterlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhona_Graff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhona Graff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_and_kill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catch and kill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://politizoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Todd-Blanche-court.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They will lay out the case that Trump falsified business records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump, 77, is already the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election in which he lost to Biden.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defense -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness.\n\nHowever, Trump has used his daily trips to the court in lower Manhattan to stage televised tirades against \"corrupt\" and \"tyrant\" Judge Juan Merchan, and to claim that the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the election campaign trail. Polls do not show the trial having any impact on his strong support from right-wing voters.\n\nRepublican Trump loyalists, including several vying to be picked as his vice president on the November ticket, have become outspoken critics of the trial and in some cases have made the trek to the courtroom to sit behind him.\n\n- Unanimity required -\n\nThe judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give final instructions to the jury on how to interpret the law.\n\nTo return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could then seek a new trial.\n\nAside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Cohen, who testified that he had arranged the $130,000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States.\"\n\nTrump's defense team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud.\n\nIn addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nHe also faces charges in Florida of storing huge quantities of classified national security documents after leaving the White

Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nDE NIRO: TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\n\nRobert De Niro said Tuesday morning that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not belong in the White House. The actor was campaigning for President Joe Biden in lower Manhattan, joined by former law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey stood not far from where closing arguments were happening in Trump's criminal hush money trial. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nDe Niro said if Trump returns to the White House, Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTHE SCENE IN THE COURTROOM\n\nDonald Trump stood and looked back for a moment after he arrived at the defense table for the start of closing arguments in his hush money trial. Sitting between two of his attorneys -- Todd Blanche and Emil Bove -- the former president appeared animated before the proceedings began, gesturing and chatting with his lawyers.\n\nSeated behind Trump are members of his family, including his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Tiffany.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURTHOUSE\n\nA small of supporters yelled \"We love Trump\" outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Tuesday morning as Donald Trump's motorcade arrived. The supporters waved American flags and were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nInside, the prosecution team made its way into the courtroom, led by Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, who is expected to make the prosecution's closing argument.\n\nAs has been his routine, Steinglass walked in carrying a file box full of papers.\n\nTRUMP FAMILY MEMBERS WILL BE IN COURT\n\nSeveral of Donald Trump's family members plan to be at court Tuesday for his hush money trial.\n\nThey include his sons, Don Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, daughter Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nOther family members have not yet joined him in court, including his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, and his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And yes, Trump paid the man who cut that deal $35,000 a month for a year in 2017 -- and even signed those checks from the White House.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, lead defense lawyer Todd Blanche told the jury that the paperwork only shows that the real estate mogul was on the receiving end of an extortion scheme and later paid a lawyer to do his job as \"personal attorney to the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"The reason why you all are here is whether and to what extent President Trump, while he was living in the White House as the leader of the free world, whether he had anything to do with how payments... were booked at the accounting ledger at Trump Tower,\" Blanche said. \"Absolutely, positively not. The bookings were accurate and there was absolutely no intent to defraud... there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\"\n\nMAGA Lawyer Gets Dismantled by His Own Damning Trump Emails\n\nThe defense strategy here is an attempt to stick to the core evidence in the case without looking any further than the 11 invoices from one-time Trump confidant Michael Cohen, 11 checks to pay him, and 12 accounting book entries.\n\nBy contrast, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office have spent five weeks building a story around this paperwork, relying on testimony from the porn star, her Beverly Hills celebrity lawyer, Cohen, and employees at the Trump Organization and White House who processed the legal expenses. In their telling, Trump was behind the NDA the entire time, sought to silence the woman in a fit of desperation to save his dying presidential campaign, and slowly paid back Cohen for fronting the money by disguising the reimbursement as ongoing service fees for nonexistent legal work.\n\nHowever, Trump's defense lawyer turned that story on its head.\n\nBlanche pointed out how Cohen admitted on the stand that he proudly became the personal lawyer to the top politician in the country in 2017, calling it a more believable explanation for the way Cohen received monthly payments. The alternative version of the story would require believing that Cohen took that high-profile job for free -- and got handsomely overpaid for silencing the porn star with $130,000 months earlier.\n\n\"That's a ridiculous story, and I'll tell you why. The idea that President Trump would agree to pay Michael Cohen $420,000 even though he only owed him $130[k] is absurd,\" Blanche said, later putting emphasis on each word. \"That! Is! Absurd!\"\n\nThe group of 18 jurors listened closely while Blanche spoke from a cherry wood-stained podium, which had been turned in their direction so he could address them directly. Blanche looked at them as he flipped through a thick black binder of notes, with Trump leaning back in his maroon leather chair a few feet behind him.\n\nMost of these jurors -- half a dozen of them are alternates in case a few drop out -- will decide whether he'll become the first convicted former U.S. president.\n\nA Paralegal's Steely Star Turn at Donald Trump's Trial\n\nNearly an hour into his closing arguments, Blanche shifted their focus to Cohen and stressed that the DA's entire case relies on the disgraced former lawyer's testimony. While Cohen claimed on the stand that his invoices were for fake legal work, Blanche pointed to a May 2017 email in which Cohen told the Trump Organization's then chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, about working on an \"open foundation matter\" relating to Trump's charity. And while Cohen on the stand asserted he had a minimal role in defending Trump from \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos, Blanche pointed to the way Cohen later acknowledged being a lead lawyer in the case.\n\nBlanche got most animated when asking jurors whether they'd believe that Cohen -- a millionaire who'd made riches in the cut-throat New York City taxi medallion industry and has earned a reputation for his arrogance and antagonism -- would really land the coveted job as the top legal adviser to the commander-in-chief and do it gratis.\n\n\"Do you believe that for a second? That after getting stiffed on his bonus in 2016 when he thought he had worked so hard, when he didn't get paid back the $20,000 he was owed, do you think Mr. Cohen thought, 'I wanna work for free.' Is that the man who testified? Or is that a lie?\" Blanche said.\n\nWhen Blanche neared the two-hour mark, Trump turned toward the jury and lifted his right arm on the back of his chair -- only to close his eyes for a minute or two at a time. His lips remained slightly puckered as he maintained a pout, clenching his jaw as his face formed a profile with a bright white computer screen in the background.\n\nThe glassiness of Blanche's voice had lulled Trump into a stupor. But the former president perked up and shifted when courtroom loudspeakers replayed surreptitiously recorded audio taken by Cohen at his former boss' office. Trump came back to life -- to hear the sound of his own voice.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Merchan gave the instructions after scolding Blanche before the break over the remark made near the end of the defense's summation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPROSECUTION BEGINS ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDEFENSE IMPL\n\nORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.", "source": {"uri":

This historic trial marks the first time a former US president faces the possibility of a criminal conviction. With less than six months before American voters decide whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes of the verdict extend far beyond Trump's personal fate, impacting the country as a whole.\n\nTrump stands accused of falsifying business records to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter, a scandal that had the potential to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison for each of the 34 counts against him. However, legal experts suggest that as a first-time offender, he is unlikely to serve jail time.\n\nCrucially, a conviction would not prevent Trump from running for president in the upcoming election. He remains the Republican frontrunner and is expected to challenge Democratic incumbent Joe Biden in November.\n\nAfter nearly five weeks of intense courtroom drama, featuring the testimony of over 20 witnesses and several high-profile moments, the trial has reached its closing arguments. This represents the final opportunity for both the prosecution and the defense to sway the anonymous 12-member jury. As anticipated, Trump chose not to testify in his defense, avoiding potential legal jeopardy and the rigors of cross-examination. Instead, he endured listening to Daniels recount their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail.\n\nThroughout the trial, Trump has been vocal outside the courtroom, often railing against Judge Juan Merchan, whom he labeled as \"corrupt\" and a \"tyrant.\" He has characterized the trial as an attempt at \"election interference\" orchestrated by Democrats to hinder his campaign efforts.\n\nThe political implications of the case have been evident, particularly in the final days, when prominent Republicans, including several potential vice-presidential candidates, showed their support by standing behind Trump as he addressed the press.\n\nJudge Merchan has indicated that closing arguments will occupy the entirety of Tuesday. Following these arguments, he will deliver his final instructions to the jury, who are expected to commence deliberations on Wednesday. A unanimous decision is required to return a guilty or not guilty verdict. A single dissenting juror would result in a hung jury and a mistrial.\n\nKey testimony for the prosecution came from Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and \"fixer.\" Cohen testified that he facilitated the $130,000 hush money payment to ensure Daniels' story would not jeopardize Trump's presidential bid. The defense sought to undermine Cohen's credibility, highlighting his past admissions of lying to Congress and his imprisonment for tax fraud.\n\nApart from this New York case, Trump faces legal battles on multiple fronts. He has been indicted in Washington, D.C., and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Additionally, he faces charges in Florida for allegedly mishandling classified documents post-presidency. None of these trials are expected to commence before the November election, leaving the New York case as the most immediate legal challenge Trump faces.\n\nThe outcome of this trial carries significant implications not only for Trump but for the broader political landscape in the United States. A conviction could energize Trump's base, who may view him as a victim of a politically motivated prosecution. Conversely, it could also galvanize his opponents, underscoring their portrayal of Trump as unfit for office.\n\nThe trial has unfolded against a backdrop of a deeply divided nation, where political allegiances often color perceptions of legal proceedings. Trump's supporters have largely dismissed the charges as a partisan witch hunt, while his detractors see the trial as a necessary step in holding him accountable for his actions.\n\nThe case hinges on whether Trump falsified business records to conceal the hush money payment to Daniels. Prosecutors argue that this payment was intended to prevent damage to Trump's 2016 campaign. Daniels' testimony detailed the alleged encounter and the subsequent efforts to buy her silence, providing a narrative of deception and cover-up.\n\nMichael Cohen's testimony was pivotal, as he described his role in orchestrating the payment and the pressure he felt to protect Trump's chances of winning the presidency. The defense countered by attacking Cohen's credibility, painting him as a disgraced lawyer with a motive to lie.\n\nTrump's legal team has focused on discrediting the key witnesses, particularly Cohen, and arguing that the payments were legal and not intended to influence the election. They have portrayed the prosecution's case as weak and politically driven, emphasizing the lack of direct evidence linking Trump to any criminal intent.\n\nBy choosing not to testify, Trump avoided the risks associated with cross-examination but also missed an opportunity to directly address the allegations against him. His defense has instead relied on casting doubt on the prosecution's motives and the credibility of their witnesses.\n\nAs the trial draws to a close, the responsibility now rests with the jury. They must weigh the evidence presented over the past five weeks and reach a unanimous decision. The complexity of the case, combined with its high-profile nature, places immense pressure on the jurors.\n\nRegardless of the verdict, the trial represents a significant moment in American history, underscoring the legal challenges that can arise when a former president is accused of criminal conduct. It also highlights the enduring impact of Trump's presidency and his continued influence on the nation's political discourse.\n\nAs the jury prepares to deliberate, the nation watches with bated breath. The trial of Donald Trump is more than just a legal proceeding; it is a reflection of the deep political and social divisions in the United States. The outcome will likely resonate far beyond the courtroom, influencing the upcoming presidential election and shaping the legacy of one of the most controversial figures in American political history. Whether Trump is found guilty or not, this trial has already made its mark as a historic and pivotal event in the ongoing saga of Donald Trump.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyblitz.net", "dataType":

It's a paper affair. This is not a meeting with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, one that President Trump has repeatedly and adamantly denied took place. \"\n\nHe argued that the allegations - that business records were falsified to conceal repayment of secret payments to Daniels - were in fact \"accurate and there was absolutely no intent to defraud.\"\n\nThe jurors are in for a long day. The defense says it will need about 2.5 hours for its conclusions; the prosecution says it will take 4.5 hours. This will take all day and could mean jurors will be asked to stay past the 4:30 p.m. finish time.\n\nThe courtroom is also packed with notable figures, including Trump's daughter Tiffany, sons Eric and Don Jr., and Eric's wife Lara, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, according to Politico. Also present: District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case.\n\nThe Biden campaign, meanwhile, is planning a news conference outside the courthouse, marking perhaps the first time the president's re-election efforts have weighed in on the trial. Two of Trump's spokespeople -- Jason Miller and Steven Cheung -- were present outside to listen to the remarks and perhaps rebut a bit for the cameras.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Donald Trump's secret trial draws to a close, as lawyers present closing arguments today before the case goes to the jury.\n\nWith huge stakes for the former and possibly future president, jurors will decide whether machinations around a 2016 payment by Michael Cohen, then Trump's lawyer, to porn star Stormy Daniels add up to conspiracy criminal in violation of campaign finance and tax laws. .\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney accuses Trump of approving an illegal scheme in the final round of the 2016 presidential campaign to bury Daniels' claim that he had a long-ago extramarital sexual relationship. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 for his silence in October, using a home equity loan that he funneled to Daniels' attorney through a shell company created expressly for the transaction. Prosecutors say the crime was that Trump authorized a false paper trail to disguise his reimbursement to Cohen as routine legal work.\n\nThe latest chapter of the trial follows nearly five weeks of testimony ranging from the mundane cataloging of financial documents to the uncomfortable details of an alleged 2006 sexual relationship between Trump and Daniels that triggered the events that led to this affair.\n\nJurors saw Daniels clash with a Trump defense attorney, Susan Necheles, over the adult entertainer's veracity, his career choices and motivations for claiming Trump cheated on his wife, Melania Trump . They watched as defense attorney Todd Blanche called Cohen a liar for his testimony about contacting Trump to signal that a deal with Daniels was imminent.\n\nThey also saw Trump's former White House communications director, Hope Hicks, cry on the stand and -- before being removed from the courtroom by Judge Juan Merchan -- saw a Trump ally, Robert Costello, grunting in a \"ridiculous\" manner when the judge was subjected to a complaint. prosecutor's objection to part of his testimony.\n\nThey heard from nearly two dozen witnesses in total, including two called as part of the defense team's relatively brief rebuttal. They have not heard from Trump, who exercised his right as a criminal defendant not to appear in court.\n\nMeanwhile, jurors saw reams of texts, emails and phone histories collected by both sides. They will have to decide whether the documents and testimony prove an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election using fraudulent accounting, or show nothing more than messy behind-the-scenes maneuvering in a national political campaign.\n\nJurors were given a week off to return to normal lives while following Merchan's instructions to avoid trial coverage and commentary. The judicial blackout imposed on jurors to avoid exposure to the unprecedented case includes social media, where Trump was busy during the break proclaiming his innocence and portraying the judge and prosecutors as his executioners. Among Trump's complaints on his Truth Social platform, Merchan gave jurors seven days off and did not sequester them. He also complained that the prosecution had the final say in the case, even though that is standard procedure in a trial.\n\nTrump denies having sex with Daniels. He and his lawyers both argue that Cohen was actually being paid for his ongoing work and that the nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed was a legal way to protect his campaign and family from this embarrassment.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2154508856.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

She was spotted departing Trump Tower in advance or her father's move to the court Tuesday morning for the first time in nearly a week. Then, she stood behind Trump as he once again railed against the prosecution.\n\nShe was seated inside the courtroom on the aisle next to Eric's wife Lara Trump, who is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her husband Michael Boulos was also there for closing arguments in the Stormy Daniels trial.\n\nTiffany, a Georgetown Law graduate, is getting the chance to see Trump lawyer Todd Blanche weave together closing arguments that were set to last about two and a half hours. It is a critical aspect of trial law, referencing evidence and testimony jurors may have heard weeks ago to try to steer them toward a verdict of not guilty.\n\nJust days ago, Blanche had asked star witness Michael Cohen during cross-examination about the apparent 'extortion' attempt involving Tiffany. It was part of an effort to undercut Cohen's own testimony that he was speaking to Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter during a critical period, rather than other matters that might have risen to the top of his to-do list.\n\n'You agree with me, right, that you had a lot going on both in your personal life and with President Trump in those first two weeks of October?' Blanche asked the witness during a long cross-examination where he poked holes in his story. 'You recall on October 25th, you recall her communicating with you concerns about somebody trying to blackmail her?' Blanche asked. 'Yes sir,' Cohen responded.\n\nThat was the day after Cohen testified that he spoke to Trump to tell him the Stormy Daniels matter was resolved and said Trump authorized the plan to pay her off. Cohen says he reached Trump on the phone by ringing Trump security chief Keith Schiller's phone.\n\nBlanche later established through text messages that Cohen was also dealing with a prank caller at the time, and accused him of lying about ever discussing the Stormy Daniels pay off during the call. Tiffany has kept a lower profile than her older siblings, whose mother is the late Ivana Trump.\n\nShe appeared with him at the 2016 Republican convention, but didn't join him at the White House like Ivanka did, and was at school during the period when Eric and Don Jr. were helming the Trump Organization along with exec Allen Weisselberg. Her appearance comes after DailyMail.com reported that Tiffany's husband Michael Boulos and his billionaire Lebanese father are helping court Arab-Americans for Trump.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The hush money trial involving Donald Trump and his alleged payments to adult entertainment star Stormy Daniels is coming to an end. The trial focused on falsifying business records to cover said payments, which are charges seldom brought to trial because it's not worth the hassle. This case isn't some Enron-like scandal.\n\nIf you want to play this game, this campaign finance violation comes with a fine, not jail time. Most cases of this nature come with a slap on the wrist. When jail time was recommended in past cases, most were no more than a month. We're dealing with a misdemeanor charge that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg opted to elevate to felony status for political reasons.\n\nSo, what's going to happen? The jury pool is biased against Trump, which we all saw during the voir dire stage of this circus. While exoneration should be the verdict since I don't know anyone who would have changed their vote if Trump's reported tryst was made public, it's either conviction or a hung jury.\n\nPolitico outlined the possible outcomes, though they did highlight at length, albeit buried in the story, how Michael Cohen was an atrocious witness for the prosecution since he's a serial liar who got exposed for being such again during cross-examination. Yet, before that, they had to go through the scenario where the former president is convicted:\n\nBroadly speaking, the D.A.'s office has provided two logical paths for jurors to use to convict Trump -- one that goes through Cohen and one that goes around him.\n\nThe path through Cohen relies on his testimony about purported conversations that he had with Trump about the relevant events in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIf you believe Cohen, his testimony broadly established Trump's involvement in and knowledge of the underlying effort to purchase Daniels' story in order to ensure that it did not hurt Trump's 2016 election chances; prosecutors have characterized that scheme as a conspiracy to influence the election using an illegal campaign contribution. Cohen's testimony also sought to establish the process for Trump reimbursing Cohen for the payment to Daniels using intentionally falsified business records.\n\nThe second path to a conviction relies on circumstantial evidence, inference and common sense -- all of which, as a legal matter, are perfectly appropriate grounds upon which jurors can render a verdict.\n\nThere is plenty of reason, even apart from the direct evidence offered by Cohen of Trump's participation in approving the deal with Daniels and signing off on the false records regarding the reimbursement, to believe that Trump was in on everything and fully aware of the legal risks and implications of what he had done.\n\nAfter all, Trump was the only full-time participant in all of the key events. He was the person who had sex with Daniels. He was the candidate running for president whose political interests were at risk if Daniels' account became public. He was a principal (represented by Cohen) in the contract negotiations to acquire Daniels' story. He was the person who ultimately gave the money for Daniels to stay quiet. And he was the head of the business whose records were falsified in the course of repaying Cohen.\n\nThese two paths -- one relying largely on Cohen's testimony, and one relying largely on circumstantial evidence of Trump's intent to conceal the commission of a crime when he reimbursed Cohen -- aren't mutually exclusive. For prosecutors to prevail, the jurors don't have to agree on their reasoning, either, as long as they agree to convict.\n\nA conviction, however, is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe most obvious path to doing so is -- and has always been -- to focus on Cohen's credibility issues. After all, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos and POLITICO Magazine in the run-up to the trial, roughly half of the country already believes that Cohen is dishonest.\n\nThese facts are arguably consistent with a legally innocuous scenario: Trump relied on his lawyer and CFO to ensure that Daniels was paid, but he was not aware of the underlying legal implications, and at the point of repaying Cohen, he did not intend to conceal the commission of \"another crime.\" Justice Juan Merchan precluded Trump's lawyers from offering a very shaky \"advice of counsel\" defense -- which basically would have allowed Trump to claim that he was simply following Cohen's advice -- but the facts about Cohen and Weisselberg's involvement hang over the case regardless, and the practical implications may prove unavoidable for one or more of the jurors.\n\nOn paper at least, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche's lengthy cross-examination of Cohen also drew out a series of damaging concessions that are likely to feature prominently in the closing argument.\n\nFirst, Blanche appears to have established that Cohen is a serial, unrepentant liar who has often lied in legal proceedings to advance his own self-interest. In addition to lying to Congress (which was plausibly done for Trump), Cohen also lied to the Justice Department, to his bank and also to the IRS -- all of which he did to help himself personally and financially. He also claims that he lied to the federal judge who took his guilty plea on tax fraud charges.\n\nSecond, Blanche appears to have established that Cohen has two classic motives to lie about Trump: vengeance and greed. Cohen acknowledged that he wants to see Trump go to prison the same way he did. He also conceded that he has made millions of dollars working in the media after turning against Trump and improbably becoming something of a hero to the sort of anti-Trump news consumers who get all of their information from cable and social media.\n\nThird, and most damagingly, Blanche credibly identified several possible lies that Cohen told on the stand when he was being questioned on direct examination by prosecutors.\n\nThere is more text in the piece about there being a hung jury verdict than a conviction in the piece, though it's buried. And yes, most it is because Cohen is not a credible witness, whose testimony is scarce on corroborating facts:\n\n\"A related weakness in the case also became clear on cross-examination: Cohen was never fully corroborated by other evidence...\n\nTake, for instance, Cohen's call with Schiller [Trump's bodyguard] (and maybe Trump) in late October 2016. The fact of the call is corroborated by phone records, but what happened on the call -- whether it was about Daniels, the 14-year-old kid prank-calling Cohen or both -- is not, and of course, it is the content of the call that matters most.\n\nThe piece lists two other instances of Cohen's testimony that cannot be verified, one of which centered on potential criminal intent on behalf of Trump regarding Cohen's reimbursement in this purported scheme. Still, the other witness, Allen Weisselberg, was never called to testify. Also, I hope it wasn't lost on anyone that Cohen seems to admit stealing money from the Trump Organization, an act that is more felonious than anything Trump is dealing with right now:\n\n\"These are all credible flaws and gaps in the prosecutors' case against Trump. Whether Trump's legal team can mine them effectively enough to persuade at least one juror to side with them, of course, remains to be seen,\" Politico added.\n\nThis trial appears to be the best shot the Left has at a conviction. With Special Counsel Jack Smith's trials against the former president postponed indefinitely and the Georgia RICO case stalled due to alleged ethics violations committed on behalf of the prosecution, this four-pronged legal offensive against Trump has fizzled for now.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt Vespa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circumstantial evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/145/4b14d1e0-03fa-4339-9363-eb1e7496a2ec.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 6326, "textEnd": 6338}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

Steinglass also cited Daniels' testimony that she came to believe that going public was the best way to protect herself and her family from pressure to stay silent.\n\nRegardless, allegations of extortion are \"not a defense to election fraud,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\"You don't get to commit election fraud or falsify business records because you believe you've been victimized,\" he told jurors.\n\nJURORS INSTRUCTED TO DISREGARD 'IMPROPER' DEFENSE COMMENT ABOUT SENDING TRUMP TO PRISON\n\nThe judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial told jurors after a lunch break that they must disregard an \"improper\" comment from defense lawyer Todd Blanche urging them not to send the former president to prison.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan gave the instructions after scolding Blanche before the break over the remark made near the end of the defense's summation.\n\nPROSECUTION BEGINS ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS FLAGS 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDEFENSE IMPLORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCES CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

During the interview, a rare public appearance for Ms. Trump, she said she was applying to law school and hoped to join the family business.\n\nIn the intervening eight years, Ms. Trump has graduated from law school at the prestigious Georgetown University Law Center at Washington, and married the scion of a wealthy Lebanese family with major business interests at Lagos. She has 1.3 million followers on Instagram, where she most recently posted pictures from her nuptials. It's unclear what Ms. Trump is doing professionally and whether she's passed the bar -- and, if so, where.\n\nShe is the daughter of Mr. Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples. Her father's messy 1990 divorce from his first wife, Ivana, sparked by his affair with Ms. Maples, became legendary in the annals of tabloid journalism, setting a precedent for coverage of future high-wattage divorces.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_payne@nysun.com", "name": "Russell Payne", "type": "author",

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nProsecutors say Trump falsified 34 business records to hide a year's worth of reimbursement payments to his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, who had fronted a $130,000 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump was not involved with any such conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, Blanche told jurors in great detail on Tuesday, during a three-hour summation.\n\nBut if he was, there was no requisite intent, Blanche argued. How could there be, he asked, when Trump freely admitted to reimbursing Cohen?\n\nBlanche then showed the jury three exhibits from the prosecution's own case.\n\nEach exhibit -- showing a tax form, a tweet, and a government ethics form -- was shown on the courtroom's display screens.\n\nEach bolsters the prosecution's case: that Trump knew full well that the $130,000 he paid Cohen in installments throughout 2017 was for reimbursement, not legal fees as his business- record entries falsely claimed.\n\n\"The government has to prove to you that President Trump caused these entries -- even if they were false -- with an intent to defraud,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\n\"Where is the intent to defraud on the part of President Trump?\" the lawyer asked the jury.\n\nProsecutors must demonstrate Trump had an intent to defraud in order to prove first-degree falsifying business records, the state charge that Trump allegedly violated 34 times throughout 2017, including when he personally signed nine of Cohen's reimbursement checks.\n\nHere are the three exhibits that Blanche displayed in court for jurors as \"proof\" that Trump had nothing to hide.\n\nThe Trump Organization -- and Trump as an individual -- reported that they'd paid Michael Cohen a total of $420,000 in 2017.\n\nProsecutors say this is the sum Trump's then CFO, Allen Weisselberg, calculated for what Cohen would be paid as reimbursement for his hush-money outlay, plus taxes and other money Trump owed him.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Trump posted a somewhat garbled tweet that concedes the payments he'd made to Cohen throughout 2017 were, in his word, \"reimbursement.\"\n\nThis tweet was made just five months after signing the last of nine $35,000 checks to Cohen. Each check was labeled \"RETAINER.\"\n\nAlso during closing arguments, Blanche showed jurors what's called an \"Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report\" for the year 2017. This was the then-president's mandatory disclosure of his assets and liabilities .\n\n\"President Trump tweeted what happened when it came out,\" and then signed a government ethics form that also admitted to the reimbursement, Blanche told jurors Tuesday.\n\n\"That's not evidence of any intent to defraud,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe defense lawyer spent most of his summation impugning the credibility of Cohen, whose testimony is key to the prosecution case.\n\nCohen is \"literally like an MVP of liars,\" Blanche told jurors. Two jurors -- a woman in the front row and a man in the back row, smiled when Blanche went on to call Cohen \"The 'Gloat'\" -- for Greatest Liar of All Time.\"\n\nDeliberations are expected to begin on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_italiano@businessinsider.com", "name": "Laura Italiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Weisselberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen Weisselberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Ethics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Ethics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6655d5f9a961b37edf3a36d8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-03", "textStart": 2030, "textEnd": 2041}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Donald Trump is seated far left, while District Attorney Alvin Bragg is seated foreground left. Judge Juan Merchan is at the bench, seated upper right. (Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nDonald Trump's lead defense attorney Todd Blanche is a former federal paralegal and prosecutor who worked for years with the Southern District of New York. On Tuesday morning, he slammed former New York City lawyer Michael Cohen, 57, as a venal liar and, by both implication and declaration, rubbished the prosecution's reliance on him to make the Empire State's case against the former president.\n\nBlanche began the defense's closing statement by repeatedly referencing a theme developed throughout the trial: that Cohen could not be trusted because he had admittedly and repeatedly lied in the past; to prosecutors, a judge, the U.S. Congress, and others. And, the defense argued, Cohen lied to the jury during his testimony this very month.\n\nAs the closing wore on, the defense attorney sought to throw several additional would-be wrenches into the works of the narrative told by the state -- arguing for a simple explanation of a highly complex case involving multiple players and mountains of documentary evidence.\n\nFor the defense, and the state, the credibility of Cohen looms large.\n\n\"You should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche told the assembled Manhattanites who will, in several hours, be asked to impose judgment on the 45th president, according to a report by MSNBC personality Katie Phang.\n\nBlanche framed the case before jurors as one that is fundamentally about documents -- the 34 different internal invoices, checks, and ledger entries that make up the 34 corresponding fraud charges. And, importantly, the defense attorney noted, the invoices in question were generated by Cohen, according to a report by Just Security fellow Adam Klasfeld.\n\n\"It's a paper case,\" Blanche said, according to a report by Newsweek reporter Katherine Fung. \"This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has repeatedly and unequivocally denied.\"\n\nThe defense insisted jurors could not possibly find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt \"on the word of Michael Cohen.\"\n\nIn service of the major point about Cohen's lack of trustworthiness, Blanche brought up the claim advanced by Cohen, as the state's star witness, that he performed \"minimal,\" if any, legal work for Trump during 2016. Later, Cohen would have to clarify that the work he did do for Trump was work he did not expect to be paid for.\n\n\"He lied to you,\" Blanche said once, and then twice, reportedly repeating the words as four-sentence fragments. \"He. Lied. To. You.\"\n\nAnother alleged lie from Cohen's lips highlighted by the defense had to do with a conversation the witness said he overheard between Trump and David Pecker, 72, the onetime CEO of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., who testified about the contours of the so-called \"catch-and-kill\" arrangement in which the tabloid giant bought and bottled up prurient stories -- true or not -- that could negatively impact Trump's 2016 candidacy, which he framed innocently as an \"agreement among friends.\"\n\n\"I don't buy any stories,\" Trump allegedly told Pecker, rebuking the publisher's suggestion that Trump himself buy up the rights to one such lurid tale. \"Anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out.\"\n\nBlanche pitted the word of Pecker, still considered a friend of Trump's, against that of Cohen, Trump's former fixer. The defense reminded jurors that, quite oppositely, Cohen testified that Trump told Pecker during that conversation: \"No problem. I will take care of it.\"\n\nAgain, the defense said, Cohen \"lied to you,\" addressing the jury.\n\nThe story Trump and Pecker were discussing was being peddled by former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed she had a nearly yearlong relationship with Trump. In the end, AMI worked out a $150,000 agreement that included hiring McDougal as a writer and model in exchange for the rights to her story, Pecker testified.\n\nWhen Cohen took the stand, he said the plan was always for AMI to be reimbursed for the money spent on the McDougal affair. Jurors also heard from a tape-recorded conversation between Cohen and Trump which the witness said was about paying back the $150,000.\n\nBut, Cohen also testified that he eventually cut off the recording to answer a phone call from a bank employee. As it turns out, that did not happen. The defense showed jurors evidence that Cohen forwarded the call to voicemail.\n\n\"He lied to you when he said he answered that call,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nThe defense also questioned why the conversation was recorded in the first place. Cohen admittedly never gave the recording to Pecker -- despite claiming that he and the publisher had a lunch, just days earlier, during which Pecker was \"very angry\" about not being repaid.\n\nBlanche directly offered the jury another alleged Cohen lie: \"Ladies and gentlemen, that lunch did not happen. Mr. Cohen made it up.\"\n\nTurning to another key witness for the state, the defense sought to cast Stormy Daniels, 45, as similarly unreliable when she testified about the agreement she and Cohen signed in exchange for the $130,000 that she was paid by Cohen in late October 2016.\n\nIn turn, Daniels would issue statements denying she ever had an affair with Trump.\n\n\"The evidence makes clear that Ms. Daniels lied to you about it,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe those statements were coerced -- that Ms. Daniels was either forced to sign them, or didn't have a say ... but she decided to go public after these statements supposedly because she was trying to protect herself from what she said was a threat someone made to her in a gym parking lot in 2011,\" Blanche said, according to a courtroom report by ABC News. \"But there are recordings where you know that's just not true.\"\n\nThe attorney went on to play a recording between Cohen and Daniels' then-attorney Keith Davidson in which the two lawyers discussed an offer from Larry Flynt for $1 million. Blanche said this conversation shows Daniels had \"settler's remorse\" for not obtaining a bigger payout.\n\nThe defense later pivoted back to Cohen's ongoing relationship with the truth and circa 2016 relationship with Trump -- casting the witness as yet unreliable and, back then, an overeager employee who overreacted to the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape and took up the Daniels effort on his own accord to help his boss.\n\nNoting that Trump himself never signed the Daniels agreement, Blanche asked out loud how it could be enforced in the first place.\n\n\"They want you to believe that President Trump thought this was going to cost him the election yet he never even signed the agreement,\" Blanche told jurors. \"What President Trump knew in 2016, you only know from one source.\"\n\nIf the reference was not clear, the defense made it so: the only source for the defendant's direct involvement in, or knowledge of the Daniels payoff as the election drew near, came by way of Cohen.\n\nDuring one particularly notable day of cross-examination, the defense unraveled some of Cohen's claims about a phone call that the witness claimed was more or less proof of Trump's involvement.\n\nThe jury had previously heard Cohen talk about a brief phone call to Keith Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard, at 8:02 p.m. on the night of Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nDueling narratives have emerged as to what was said -- and to whom -- during that phone call. To hear the state tell it initially, Cohen made that call simply to relay the details of a pending settlement to the threat posed by Stormy Daniels, 45. The defense, however, forced a telling omission: text messages showed Cohen had actually called Schiller to discuss a 14-year-old prank caller who would not let up.\n\nThe state later showed jurors an image of Trump and his former bodyguard together on the night in question in an effort to clean things up. The defense had objected to that picture being shown.\n\nBut it was the words, not the picture, the defense brought up on Tuesday.\n\n\"He told you he talked to President Trump on October 24 at 8:02 p.m. updating him about the Daniels situation,\" Blanche said of Cohen. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed. We all know he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that. That is perjury.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)",

And yes, Trump paid the man who cut that deal $35,000 a month for a year in 2017 -- and even signed those checks from the White House.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, lead defense lawyer Todd Blanche told the jury that the paperwork only shows that the real estate mogul was on the receiving end of an extortion scheme and later paid a lawyer to do his job as \"personal attorney to the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"The reason why you all are here is whether and to what extent President Trump, while he was living in the White House as the leader of the free world, whether he had anything to do with how payments... were booked at the accounting ledger at Trump Tower,\" Blanche said. \"Absolutely, positively not. The bookings were accurate and there was absolutely no intent to defraud... there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\"\n\nThe defense strategy here is an attempt to stick to the core evidence in the case without looking any further than the 11 invoices from one-time Trump confidant Michael Cohen, 11 checks to pay him, and 12 accounting book entries.\n\nBy contrast, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office have spent five weeks building a story around this paperwork, relying on testimony from the porn star, her Beverly Hills celebrity lawyer, Cohen, and employees at the Trump Organization and White House who processed the legal expenses. In their telling, Trump was behind the NDA the entire time, sought to silence the woman in a fit of desperation to save his dying presidential campaign, and slowly paid back Cohen for fronting the money by disguising the reimbursement as ongoing service fees for nonexistent legal work.\n\nHowever, Trump's defense lawyer turned that story on its head.\n\nBlanche pointed out how Cohen admitted on the stand that he proudly became the personal lawyer to the top politician in the country in 2017, calling it a more believable explanation for the way Cohen received monthly payments. The alternative version of the story would require believing that Cohen took that high-profile job for free -- and got handsomely overpaid for silencing the porn star with $130,000 months earlier.\n\n\"That's a ridiculous story, and I'll tell you why. The idea that President Trump would agree to pay Michael Cohen $420,000 even though he only owed him $130[k] is absurd,\" Blanche said, later putting emphasis on each word. \"That! Is! Absurd!\"\n\nThe group of 18 jurors listened closely while Blanche spoke from a cherry wood-stained podium, which had been turned in their direction so he could address them directly. Blanche looked at them as he flipped through a thick black binder of notes, with Trump leaning back in his maroon leather chair a few feet behind him.\n\nMost of these jurors -- half a dozen of them are alternates in case a few drop out -- will decide whether he'll become the first convicted former U.S. president.\n\nNearly an hour into his closing arguments, Blanche shifted their focus to Cohen and stressed that the DA's entire case relies on the disgraced former lawyer's testimony. While Cohen claimed on the stand that his invoices were for fake legal work, Blanche pointed to a May 2017 email in which Cohen told the Trump Organization's then chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, about working on an \"open foundation matter\" relating to Trump's charity. And while Cohen on the stand asserted he had a minimal role in defending Trump from \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant Summer Zervos, Blanche pointed to the way Cohen later acknowledged being a lead lawyer in the case.\n\nBlanche got most animated when asking jurors whether they'd believe that Cohen -- a millionaire who'd made riches in the cut-throat New York City taxi medallion industry and has earned a reputation for his arrogance and antagonism -- would really land the coveted job as the top legal adviser to the commander-in-chief and do it gratis.\n\n\"Do you believe that for a second? That after getting stiffed on his bonus in 2016 when he thought he had worked so hard, when he didn't get paid back the $20,000 he was owed, do you think Mr. Cohen thought, 'I wanna work for free.' Is that the man who testified? Or is that a lie?\" Blanche said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There's nothing illegal, there's nothing sinister about it,\" he told jurors on Tuesday in a callback to his opening statements.\n\nWhile prosecutors acknowledge the general legality of NDAs, they contend the hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels is an exception, allegedly breaching federal campaign finance laws. However, they did not charge Trump with a campaign finance violation.\n\nResponding to the prosecution's claims of a conspiracy to sway the election, Blanche argued that every campaign involves coordinated efforts to support a candidate. He further questioned the supposed influence of a \"catch-and-kill\" operation led by former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\n\"The notion that stories in the National Enquirer would sway the election is absurd. Millions of people voted. To think that a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower would impact an election defies logic,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche concluded his defense by outlining 10 points of reasonable doubt, emphasizing the public nature of some stories that prosecutors accused Trump of illegally concealing and the lack of evidence supporting the claim that Trump had an intent to defraud or even that he had any direct involvement in the payments at the heart of the case.\n\nThe defense attorney argued to the jury that the $420,000 payment from Trump to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen was intended for legal services, not to reimburse hush money paid to Daniels. Blanche explained that Cohen had requested his annual bonus, not repayment for the hush money.\n\n\"Do you believe that for a second?\" Blanche asked the jurors, challenging the notion that Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000 when he only owed him $130,000, the amount of the hush money payment. \"After being denied his bonus in 2016 despite believing he had worked tirelessly, do you think Mr. Cohen would decide to work for free?\"\n\nAddressing the 34 counts alleging falsified records in the first degree, Blanche highlighted that the charges require proof of an \"intent to defraud,\" which he defined as having a conscious objective or purpose to deceive in making the allegedly false filings.\n\n\"There is no evidence of that, ladies and gentlemen,\" Blanche stated. \"How can there be an intent to defraud when [Trump] disclosed it to the IRS, tweeted about it, and included it in his Office of Government Ethics forms?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe jury, consisting of 18 members, with 12 tasked to deliberate and six sitting as alternates, will soon decide Trump's fate, starting deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe 34 charges include 11 counts of falsified invoices, 12 counts of falsified general ledger entries, and 11 counts of falsely recording hush money payments.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaelan_deese@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Kaelan Deese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pecker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Government_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Office of Government Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_ledger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24149650975552.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Trump has denied having sex with both women. His lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her can be trusted in their testimony.\n\n\"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the daylong summations teed up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political implications of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden's campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Blanche reminded jurors that the case was not a referendum on their views about Trump.\n\nSteinglass sought to defray potential juror concerns about witness credibility. He acknowledged that Daniels' account about the alleged 2006 encounter in Lake Tahoe hotel suite was at times \"cringeworthy\" but said the details she offered -- including about the decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump's toiletry kit -- were full of touchstones \"that kind of ring true.\"\n\nThe story matters, he said, because it \"reinforces (Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Steinglass said. He told jurors: \"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nHe also tried to reassure jurors that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key witness at trial.\n\n\"It's not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It's not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen. It's whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nThough the case featured seamy details about sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges turn on something more mundane: reimbursements Trump signed for Cohen for the hush money payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction and to illicitly interfere in the 2016 election. Defense lawyers say Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Trump and his family.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn his own hourslong address to the jury, with sweeping denials echoing Trump's \"deny everything\" approach, Blanche attacked the entire foundation of the case.\n\nHe said Cohen, not Trump, created the invoices that were submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement and that there was no proof that Trump knew what staffers were doing with the payments. He disputed the contention that Trump and Daniels had sex, and he rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\"Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\" Blanche said.\n\nBut as expected, he reserved his most animated attack for Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \"GOAT,\" used primarily in sports as an acronym for \"greatest of all time,\" Blanche labeled Cohen the \"GLOAT\" -- greatest liar of all time. The lawyer also called Cohen \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" That language was intentional because, to convict Trump, jurors must believe that prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depend on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" Blanche said.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nCohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \"My entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\" he said.\n\nSteinglass used a bit of stagecraft to challenge the defense's assertion that Cohen was lying about the subject of that phone conversation, demonstrating a hypothetical version of the call to show jurors how Cohen and the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, could have covered multiple subjects in less than a minute.\n\nCohen's actual call to Schiller's phone number lasted 96 seconds, according to phone records. Steinglass showed, with his hypothetical, that Cohen could've spoken to Schiller about the prank calls, asked him to pass the phone to Trump and then discussed the Daniels deal with Trump, all in 49 seconds.\n\nThe New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.\n\nWhere each Trump case stands Classified documents case Election interference Hush money scheme Georgia election indictment Civil cases Arizona election indictment\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump case.\n\n\"This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said in remarks to the media before heading into the Manhattan courtroom Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it, I'm here because of crooked Joe Biden. The worst president in the history of our country, he's destroying our country. This country is being destroyed rapidly, not slowly, rapidly. On the borders, on energy, on inflation, on everything you can name, Afghanistan removal. Everything about what he's done, he's destroying our country and he's also destroying it with weaponization. And this is purely is weaponization,\" Trump added in his remarks.\n\nTrump, who has been flanked by a handful of allies in recent days during court proceedings, was joined by his children Tiffany, Eric, and Don Jr. on Tuesday.

TRUMP TRIAL AS JUDGE CONSIDERS DISMISSAL REQUEST\n\nTrump is facing the end of the trial in Manhattan, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to former pornographic star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to quiet her claims of an alleged affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any affair with Daniels.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: CLOSING ARGUMENTS TO BEGIN AS MERCHAN SKIRTS DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nPresiding Judge Juan Merchan said last week he anticipates closing arguments to last all of Tuesday and perhaps part of Wednesday. Merchan, this week, will also deliver his instructions to the jury, which he anticipates will last roughly an hour.\n\nTrump has been required to sit in the courtroom throughout the trial, and is also required in the courtroom during deliberations in the event of any jury notes.\n\nClosing arguments follow Trump's defense team motioned for dismissal of the case following the prosecution team's star witness, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche said last week there were \"absolutely no false business filings\" and no evidence of connection to Trump.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: HOUSE GOP LAWMAKER URGES MERCHAN TO DISMISS CASE OVER 'FATAL FLAWS,' REFER TO FEC\n\n\"How on earth is keeping a false story from voters criminal?\" Blanche said.\n\n\"There is no way the court should let this case go to the jury with Mr. Cohen's testimony,\" he added.\n\nCohen testified before the court he personally paid Daniels $130,000 by taking out a home equity line of credit, which he said he concealed from his wife. Cohen also admitted in testimony that he stole thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: DEFENSE RESTS WITHOUT CALLING FORMER PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY; MOTION TO DISMISS PENDING\n\nCohen said that he stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization by overstating how much he paid a tech company that provided services for the company. Cohen said he told former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg in 2017 that he had paid tech firm Red Finch $50,000 out of his own pocket, and that he still needed to be reimbursed for the payment.\n\nWeisselberg and Cohen in 2017 calculated a $420,000 repayment to Cohen for his $130,000 payment to Daniels, as well as the alleged $50,000 payment to Red Finch.\n\n\"You stole from the Trump Org, right?\" Blanche asked Cohen last Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Cohen responded.\n\nSTEFANIK FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE, CITES DAUGHTER'S WORK FOR GROUP PROMOTING DEMS\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump also said his team had an election expert who was set to testify last week and show that \"everything was perfect\" referring to former FEC Commissioner Bradley Smith.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office is working to prove to the jury that not only did Trump falsify the business records related to payments to Daniels, but that he did so in furtherance of another crime: conspiracy to promote or prevent election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe election expert did not testify after Merchan ruled that Smith could speak before the court on the basic definitions surrounding election law but not expand beyond that scope.\n\n\"And we had a lot of other people.

It's simply not allowed. Period,\" he said.\n\nThe judge later told the jury to \"disregard\" Mr Blanche's comments. He told them not to \"speculate\" on matters of sentencing, adding: \"A prison sentence is not required in the charges of this case.\"\n\nThe case against Mr Trump centres on a $130,000 hush money payment to silence Stormy Daniels, a porn film actress, about an alleged tryst with Mr Trump in the weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nMr Cohen claims he made the payment to Ms Daniels at his former boss's behest. The charges relate to Mr Trump's alleged attempt to \"cook the books\" to repay Mr Cohen.\n\nOutside the courthouse Robert De Niro, the actor and long-standing critic of Mr Trump, held an impromptu press conference on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nSpeaking next to a group of Mr Trump's supporters, DeNiro described Mr Trump as a \"clown\" and a \"tyrant\", adding: \"This is the time to stop him.\"\n\nIt's legal warfare, say Trump sons\n\nMr Trump's oldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, also addressed the crowds outside, describing the court proceedings as an \"abomination\", and \"legal warfare\".\n\nIn court, Mr Blanche told the jury: \"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period.\"\n\nThe lawyer repeatedly locked eyes with jurors and shouted that Mr Cohen was a liar and a thief.\n\n\"He's the human embodiment of reasonable doubt,\" he said. \"He lies constantly. He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nLater, he added that Mr Cohen was \"the GLOAT... literally the greatest liar of all time\".\n\nMr Blanche became impassioned as he revisited his Perry Mason moment of the trial - when he attempted to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Mr Trump by phone about the arrangement with Ms Daniels on Oct 24.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Mr Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Mr Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls from a teenager.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Mr Blanche shouted. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nCohen was 'ultimate insider'\n\nDuring his closing arguments for the prosecution, Mr Steinglass defended Mr Cohen's credibility, describing him as the \"ultimate insider\".\n\n\"The question is not whether you like Michael Cohen or whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen\", he said. \"The truth is he was in the best position to know... because he was at the defendant's right hand.\"\n\nHe also responded to the defence's attacks on Ms Daniels as an extortionist who wanted to cash in on the fallout from the infamous Access Hollywood tape.\n\nMr Steinglass said her sometimes \"cringeworthy\" testimony about the sexual encounter she claims took place was vital because it \"only reinforces his incentive to buy her silence\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the jury is expected to begin its deliberations to decide whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee just months before the 2024 election.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denies ever having a sexual encounter with Ms

Trump is the first former President to face a criminal trial and his conviction or acquittal could impact the closely fought presidential election pitching him against President Joe Biden.\n\nThis is the only one of four criminal cases pending against him that will be decided before the November election where early opinion polls show them virtually tied with Trump having a 1.1 per cent lead, according to the aggregation of polls by RealClear Politics.\n\nTrump's lawyers took aim at the credibility of his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen who paid off the porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public with allegations that she had a sexual encounter with him. The case hinges on a payment of $130,000 to Daniels that was recorded in Trump's business ledgers as legal fees to Cohen.\n\nThe prosecutors, who were to follow Trump's lawyers, allege that it is a criminal falsification of business records as the money was a payoff to avoid a scandal during the 2016 election campaign and the money was not lawyer's fees, and, therefore, the payoff was also an election interference.\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche in his closing arguments on Tuesday countered that the business records were accurate as the payments were made directly to Cohen and the former President was not aware of what Cohen did with the checks. He said that the prosecution's star witness Cohen, who admitted on the witness stand to stealing $30,000 from Trump and made contradictory statements, was not a credible witness.\n\nBlanche said that the sexual encounter claimed by Daniels 18 years ago and denied by Trump was not an issue in the case.\n\nThe panel of 12 jurors made up of ordinary citizens under the New York State legal system are expected to begin deliberating the case in private on Wednesday.\n\nEach juror has a veto because a unanimous verdict is required to convict or acquit him and if they cannot agree on a united verdict, Judge Juan Merchan will have to declare a mistrial, which will not amount to an acquittal, and allow the prosecution to retry him.\n\nThe jury could also convict him unanimously on some parts of the charges. If convicted, Trump faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\n\nThat would create the strange spectacle of Secret Service agents accompanying him to prison to provide protection mandated for him as a former President by US law.\n\nHe would certainly appeal a conviction, keeping him out of prison during the presidential campaign and the Republican Party Convention in July that will officially make him the party candidate.\n\nMerchan, however, has threatened Trump with being sent to prison for contempt of court if he continued to criticise persons connected to the case, which Trump has defiantly continued.\n\nBefore entering the court, Trump told reporters: \"This is all election hunting, election interfering, going after Joe Biden's opponent because he can't do it himself.\"\n\nThe prosecutor waited seven years to bring the case in the middle of the campaign, he said.\n\nManhattan Public Prosecutor Melvin Bragg, who brought the case, is a Democrat elected to the post in a partisan election. While the lawyers made their final arguments, outside a raucous scene played out with his supporters and opponents holding demonstrations with colourful banners and posters. President Joe Biden's campaign added to the drama, bringing Actor Robert DeNiro outside the courthouse to denounce Trump accusing him of wanting to \"destroy not only this city and country, but the whole world\" and reciting an obscenity-laced litany of the former President's failings.\n\n(Arul Louis can be contacted at arul.l@ians.in and followed at @arulouis)", "source": {"uri":

His closing argument offered another reprise.\n\nAs Donald Trump's Manhattan hush money trial reached its final chapter on Tuesday, the former president took what's become his customary morning walk through the center of a downtown courtroom, passing his eyes across the rows of reporters who have been studying his glances for the past five weeks. He was trailed by family members (Don Jr., Eric, and Tiffany, but not Melania, Ivanka, or Barron) who had arrived for the occasion of closing arguments; his usual cohort of aides and advisers (Jason Miller and Boris Epshteyn); and, following directly behind him, his lead attorney Todd Blanche, who was slated to offer the last word in his client's defense.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal a payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels for keeping quiet about her claim that they had sex. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen arranged the hush money deal in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election -- in an effort, prosecutors have argued, to stem the scrutiny of Trump's relationships with women that followed the release of the Access Hollywood tape -- and he was the final witness in the prosecution's case. The personnel were the problem, Blanche suggested as he began his remarks. \"You should want and expect more than the testimony of Michael Cohen,\" he told the jury, and \"something beyond the word of a woman who claimed that something happened in 2006.\"\n\nBut Blanche also emphasized a point that has sometimes been lost amid the flurry of attention paid to the boldface names involved in the trial. \"The case is about documents,\" the attorney said. \"It's a paper case.\" It was not, in other words, about \"an encounter that President Trump has repeatedly and unequivocally denied,\" he went on, or even the payment to Daniels.\n\nDuring the beginning of Blanche's statement, Trump turned toward his lawyer -- in the direction of the jury. As throughout the trial, though, the jurors and the former president never seemed to make eye contact. Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney whom Trump has repeatedly vilified over the last year, has been absent from the trial since opening statements over a month ago. He sat in the second row of the courtroom on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche is not charismatic, exactly, or particularly fluid, but he projects a pleading sturdiness. \"The words that Michael Cohen said to you on that stand,\" he told the jury, \"they matter.\" Cohen's admitted track record of lying was the prevailing motif. And while, as promised, Blanche's remarks revolved around the dry details of the business records in question, they also turned on a more human element. \"What the government did for the past five weeks at the end of the day,\" Blanche said, \"is ask you to believe the man who testified two weeks ago.\" (Or, as one of the headings in his slideshow presentation put it, \"Case Turns On Cohen.\")", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Epshteyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boris Epshteyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/665616baeb45302c396c234c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/donald-trump-trial.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Trump said Tuesday in the closing argument of his criminal hush-money trial that the former president was not only innocent, but also a victim of extortion by liars seeking his demise.\n\nThe person in fact at fault was Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer and a key witness for prosecutors in the first criminal case against a former American president, said Todd Blanche, the lawyer who delivered the closing argument.\n\nDuring a sometimes meandering three-hour closing presentation, Mr. Blanche declared that Mr. Cohen lied directly to the jury and that Mr. Trump did not know about Mr. Cohen's hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who said she had sex with the former president.\n\nMr. Blanche used sports metaphors and a rambling Top 10 list in an effort to convince the 12 jurors of Mr. Trump's innocence, repeatedly taking aim at Mr. Cohen.\n\n\"He's literally like the M.V.P. of liars,\" Mr. Blanche told the jury.\n\nLater, Mr. Blanche tried a different sports-inspired description: \"Michael Cohen is the G.L.O.A.T.,\" he said, short for the \"greatest liar of all time.\"\n\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records that stem from the $130,000 payment by Mr. Cohen to Ms. Daniels, who had been considering going public in the days before the 2016 election with her account of a sexual encounter a decade before.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Mr. Trump falsified records when he repaid Mr. Cohen in 2017 for that deal, deliberately mislabeling reimbursements as \"legal expenses\" to conceal their true purpose. The financial documents were processed by the Trump Organization, the former president's family business.\n\nMr. Blanche told jurors Tuesday that the prosecution had not met its burden of proof, adding that the evidence \"should leave you wanting more.\" He reminded the jury that only Mr. Cohen had testified that Mr. Trump knew everything about the hush-money payment to Ms. Daniels.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump on any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen,\" Mr. Blanche said.\n\nMr. Blanche said that Mr. Cohen had an ax to grind because he did not appreciate what Mr. Trump \"did and did not do for him\" after taking office.\n\nMr. Blanche said that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that Mr. Trump had plotted to falsify records related to reimbursing Mr. Cohen. He also said that Mr. Cohen had a legitimate legal retainer with Mr. Trump as his personal lawyer. The records were not false, Mr. Blanche claimed, because of an oral retainer agreement.

There was the former porn star, the tabloid editor, her disgraced former fixer, the former press secretary who burst into tears on the stand.\n\nThey all spent much of their testimony rehashing a story that has been public for years. Yet they also revealed new details about Trump's alleged scheme to pay Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public with their sexual relationship, a move at the heart of the prosecution's case against Trump.\n\nTrump denies having an affair with Daniels and claims he was falsely accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide his payments and buy his silence before the 2016 election.\n\nClosing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday and a jury could return its verdict as soon as this week.\n\nHere are five things we learned during the trial:\n\nThe National Enquirer executive described a partnership with Trump aimed at bolstering his presidential bid.\n\nTo make their case, prosecutors must convince the jury that Trump's main concern was his campaign when he paid Stormy Daniels to stay silent and falsified business records to hide the payments.\n\nTrump's longtime friend David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enqurier, may have reinforced that point when he spoke and described an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower when he agreed to be Trump's eyes and ears to help bury damaging stories during his term. campaign.\n\nPecker, with his gray hair pulled back into a collar-length mullet, told the jury how Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer at the time, called him in August 2015 and said that The Boss, his nickname for Trump wanted him to come to Trump Tower. Pecker described talking with Trump and Cohen for 20 to 25 minutes and that his former aide Hope Hicks was in and out of the room during their meeting. Trump wanted to know how the Enquirer could help Trump's campaign, Pecker said. Pecker described how he offered to publish positive articles about Trump, negative articles about his opponents, and to inform Trump when women contacted reporters with stories about the real estate mogul.\n\n\"I said I would be your eyes and ears because I know the Trump Organization had a very small staff,\" Pecker told the jury. And then I said anything I heard in the market, if I heard anything negative about yourself or if I heard anything about women selling stories, I would let Michael Cohen know and he would get another magazine to kill the story or someone would have to buy them.\n\nPecker described how he then bought a story about Trump from a doorman at Trump Tower and another from a former Playboy model. But when it came to suppressing Daniel's story, Pecker said he didn't want the National Enquirer associated with a porn actress. Michael Cohen ended up paying Daniels directly and said Trump agreed to reimburse him.\n\nPecker established that they intended to make these profits for this campaign as early as the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015, said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and a former adviser to the committee. House Judiciary, led by Democrats. during Trump's first impeachment.\n\nRead more: What happens if Trump is found guilty? Your questions, answers\n\nHope Hicks said Trump was worried about Stormy Daniels' story coming to light before the 2016 election.\n\nHicks, Trump's former communications director, broke down crying on the witness stand moments after describing why Trump was so motivated to keep certain stories out of the public eye before the election.\n\nThe prosecution questioned Hicks about a conversation she had with Trump in February 2018, as information began to emerge that Stormy Daniels had been paid to remain silent about her sexual relationship with Trump in 2006.\n\nHicks was Trump's White House communications director and then sat at a desk just outside the Oval Office. She described Trump asking her how information about her affair with Daniels was being spread in the press. Trump seemed relieved that the story hadn't come to light sooner, Hicks said.\n\nHe wanted to know how it was going, and just my thoughts and my opinion on this story versus a different story before the campaign if Michael hadn't made that payment, Hicks said. And I think Mr. Trump's view was that it was better to deal with it now and it would have been bad for this story to have been made public before the election.\n\nAfter saying that, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said: No further questions. She started crying moments later.\n\nStormy Daniels described being pressured to have sex with Trump\n\nDaniels told the jury she felt there was a power imbalance when Trump allegedly had sex with her in a Nevada hotel room in 2006. She described meeting Trump at a tournament celebrity golf course on the shores of Lake Tahoe, the first meeting that took place for the first time. motion on the events of the case. She was 27 years old at the time and was attending the event to promote a porn studio. Trump invited her to his hotel room to discuss his reality TV show The Apprentice, she said.\n\nDaniels gave specific details about her time with Trump. She described Trump's bodyguard telling her which elevator to take to get to the penthouse, describing the double doors leading into the room and the black-and-white tile floor. She remembers talking to him and then excusing herself to go to the bathroom where she looked in her toiletry bag and saw Old Spice and Pert Plus and gold tweezers in a manicure set. When she came out of the bathroom, she saw that Trump was on the bed, between her and the exit, wearing his boxers and a T-shirt.\n\nDaniels said she was surprised and thought, Oh, my God, what did I misread to get here. I thought, great. I put myself in this bad situation.\n\nShe remembers that Trump had the upper hand at the moment. I noticed there was a bodyguard right outside the door. There was certainly an imbalance of power. He was bigger and blocked the way. But I mean, I wasn't threatened verbally or physically, she said. She said she lost consciousness and the next thing she knew she was on her back on the bed. Daniels told the jury that the sex was brief and that Trump was not wearing a condom, and she said that concerned her. Trump denies having sex with Daniels.\n\nAs Daniels left Trump's hotel room, Daniels recalled Trump telling him, \"We should meet again.\" We were fantastic together. I want you to be on the show.\n\n\"I told very few people that we had sex because I was ashamed of myself for not stopping him, for not saying no,\" Daniels said.\n\nA handwritten note described that Michael Cohen received a $130,000 refund.\n\nThe central point of the case is whether Trump himself paid for Daniels to remain silent and concealed that payment as legal fees from Cohen.\n\nOn May 6, prosecutors showed the jury a handwritten note written by Jeffrey McConney, a former Trump Organization executive, that they said described why Cohen was paid. The memo describes a reimbursement to Cohen for a wire transfer of $130,000, the amount Cohen paid Daniels.\n\nProsecutors want the jury to consider that note as a crucial part of a paper trail showing that Trump intended to repay Cohen for the reward paid to Daniels, Eisen says. We learned that there was an irrefutable document that we had never seen before, explains Eisen.\n\nRead more: Central witnesses in Trump and Hush-Money trials share tortured history\n\nMichael Cohen admitted to stealing from the Trump Organization\n\nThis handwritten document cuts both ways for the prosecution. While this helped bolster their case against Trump, it also undermined the credibility of their already flawed witness, Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer.\n\nMuch of the prosecution's case rests on the words of Cohen, a convicted perjurer. In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to several crimes involving the hush money scheme, including lying to Congress and federal investigators.\n\nAfter the prosecution highlighted the $130,000 payment on the note, Trump's lawyers asked Cohen to explain another part of that tally of reimbursements to Cohen, specifically a payment intended for the technology company Red Finch to rig Trump's ratings in certain polls. Cohen paid Red Finch $20,000 but billed the Trump Organization $50,000, pocketing the difference.\n\nTrump's defense attorney questioned Cohen about the extra money he added when seeking reimbursement from the Trump Organization.\n\nYou stole from the Trump Organization, didn't you? Trump's defense attorney, Todd Blanche, questioned Cohen on cross-examination.\n\nYes, sir, said Cohen.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri":

There's nothing illegal, there's nothing sinister about it,\" he told jurors on Tuesday in a callback to his opening statements.\n\nWhile prosecutors acknowledge the general legality of NDAs, they contend the hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels is an exception, allegedly breaching federal campaign finance laws. However, they did not charge Trump with a campaign finance violation.\n\nResponding to the prosecution's claims of a conspiracy to sway the election, Blanche argued that every campaign involves coordinated efforts to support a candidate. He further questioned the supposed influence of a \"catch-and-kill\" operation led by former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.\n\n\"The notion that stories in the National Enquirer would sway the election is absurd. Millions of people voted. To think that a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower would impact an election defies logic,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche concluded his defense by outlining 10 points of reasonable doubt, emphasizing the public nature of some stories that prosecutors accused Trump of illegally concealing and the lack of evidence supporting the claim that Trump had an intent to defraud or even that he had any direct involvement in the payments at the heart of the case.\n\nThe defense attorney argued to the jury that the $420,000 payment from Trump to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen was intended for legal services, not to reimburse hush money paid to Daniels. Blanche explained that Cohen had requested his annual bonus, not repayment for the hush money.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Do you believe that for a second?\" Blanche asked the jurors, challenging the notion that Trump would agree to pay Cohen $420,000 when he only owed him $130,000, the amount of the hush money payment. \"After being denied his bonus in 2016 despite believing he had worked tirelessly, do you think Mr. Cohen would decide to work for free?\"\n\nAddressing the 34 counts alleging falsified records in the first degree, Blanche highlighted that the charges require proof of an \"intent to defraud,\" which he defined as having a conscious objective or purpose to deceive in making the allegedly false filings.\n\n\"There is no evidence of that, ladies and gentlemen,\" Blanche stated. \"How can there be an intent to defraud when [Trump] disclosed it to the IRS, tweeted about it, and included it in his Office of Government Ethics forms?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe jury, consisting of 18 members, with 12 tasked to deliberate and six sitting as alternates, will soon decide Trump's fate, starting deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe 34 charges include 11 counts of falsified invoices, 12 counts of falsified general ledger entries, and 11 counts of falsely recording hush money payments.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\n\"He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depends on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\" the attorney told jurors before he ended his closing arguments.\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims is that Mr. Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Daniels payment. But Mr. Blanche pointed to emails and testimony showing that Mr. Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for President Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Mr. Blanche said it wasn't the case. \"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" he said.\n\nMr. Blanche added that Mr. Cohen went on television to discuss his role as the former president's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature of every email that he sent. \"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Cohen told the court that he was directed by President Trump to initiate the repayment plan that involved payments to Ms. Daniels. He also said that the former president was directly involved in the plan and personally authorized the payments, which prosecutors say were illegally logged as legal expenses to cover up an alleged crime.\n\nProsecutors argued that the alleged scheme was designed to conceal the true purpose of the payments to Ms. Daniels, illegal interference with the 2016 election.\n\n\"What the government did for the past five weeks, at the end of the day, is ask you to believe the man who testified two weeks ago: Michael Cohen,\" Blanche told jurors. \"Michael Cohen asked you to ignore the documents, ignore what the email says about sending a retainer agreement sought by [former Trump Organizaton official Allen] Weisselberg, asked you to believe that he worked for free.\"\n\nAfter Mr. Cohen's testimony several weeks ago, President Trump has been unable to directly respond to him due to a gag order that was issued by Judge Juan Merchan that prohibits him from speaking about witnesses and other individuals connected to the case. The former president has tried to appeal the order, which has been rejected by the judge and a state appeals court.\n\nAs he ended his arguments, Mr. Blanche told the jurors that they should return a not-guilty verdict and implored them to leave their political biases at home.\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" he told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" he added.\n\nProsecutors are still scheduled to make their closing arguments in the case starting Tuesday.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted a representative for Mr. Cohen for comment.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retainer agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/26/id5638660-Trump-trial-GettyImages-2149701129-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-24", "textStart": 586, "textEnd": 599}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Trump case.\n\n\"This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said in remarks to the media before heading into the Manhattan courtroom Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it, I'm here because of crooked Joe Biden. The worst president in the history of our country, he's destroying our country. This country is being destroyed rapidly, not slowly, rapidly. On the borders, on energy, on inflation, on everything you can name, Afghanistan removal. Everything about what he's done, he's destroying our country, and he's also destroying it with weaponization. And this is purely is weaponization,\" Trump added in his remarks.\n\nTrump, who has been flanked by a handful of allies in recent days during court proceedings, was joined by his children Tiffany, Eric, and Don Jr. on Tuesday. Trump has repeatedly slammed the trial as a \"sham\" promoted by the Biden administration to politically injure him ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: CLOSING ARGUMENTS TO BEGIN IN NY V. TRUMP TRIAL AS JUDGE CONSIDERS DISMISSAL REQUEST\n\nTrump is facing the end of the trial in Manhattan, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to former pornographic star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to quiet her claims of an alleged affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any affair with Daniels.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: CLOSING ARGUMENTS TO BEGIN AS MERCHAN SKIRTS DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nPresiding Judge Juan Merchan said last week he anticipates closing arguments to last all of Tuesday and perhaps part of Wednesday. Merchan, this week, will also deliver his instructions to the jury, which he anticipates will last roughly an hour.\n\nTrump has been required to sit in the courtroom throughout the trial and is also required in the courtroom during deliberations in the event of any jury notes.\n\nClosing arguments follow Trump's defense team motioning for dismissal of the case following the prosecution team's star witness, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche said last week there were \"absolutely no false business filings\" and no evidence of connection to Trump.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: HOUSE GOP LAWMAKER URGES MERCHAN TO DISMISS CASE OVER 'FATAL FLAWS,' REFER TO FEC\n\n\"How on Earth is keeping a false story from voters criminal?\" Blanche said.\n\n\"There is no way the court should let this case go to the jury with Mr. Cohen's testimony,\" he added.\n\nCohen testified before the court he personally paid Daniels $130,000 by taking out a home equity line of credit, which he said he concealed from his wife. Cohen also admitted in testimony that he stole thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization.\n\nNY V. TRUMP: DEFENSE RESTS WITHOUT CALLING FORMER PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY; MOTION TO DISMISS PENDING\n\nCohen said that he stole $30,000 from the Trump Organization by overstating how much he paid a tech company that provided services for the company. Cohen said he told former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg in 2017 that he had paid tech firm Red Finch $50,000 out of his own pocket, and that he still needed to be reimbursed for the payment.\n\nWeisselberg and Cohen in 2017 calculated a $420,000 repayment to Cohen for his $130,000 payment to Daniels, as well as the alleged $50,000 payment to Red Finch.\n\n\"You stole from the Trump Org, right?\" Blanche asked Cohen last Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Cohen responded.\n\nSTEFANIK FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE, CITES DAUGHTER'S WORK FOR GROUP PROMOTING DEMS\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump also said his team had an election expert who was set to testify last week and show that \"everything was perfect\" referring to former FEC Commissioner Bradley Smith.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office is working to prove to the jury that not only did Trump falsify the business records related to payments to Daniels, but that he did so in furtherance of another crime: conspiracy to promote or prevent election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe election expert did not testify after Merchan ruled that Smith could speak before the court on the basic definitions surrounding election law but not expand beyond that scope.\n\n\"And we had a lot of other people.

Troy Nehls, R-Texas.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Closing arguments in Donald Trump 's historic hush money trial are set to begin Tuesday morning, giving prosecutors and defense attorneys one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin.\n\nJurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as \"legal expenses\" to hide the true nature of the transactions.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's simply not allowed. Period,\" he said.\n\nThe judge later told the jury to \"disregard\" Mr Blanche's comments. He told them not to \"speculate\" on matters of sentencing, adding: \"A prison sentence is not required in the charges of this case.\"\n\nThe case against Mr Trump centres on a $130,000 hush money payment to silence Stormy Daniels, a porn film actress, about an alleged tryst with Mr Trump in the weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nMr Cohen claims he made the payment to Ms Daniels at his former boss's behest. The charges relate to Mr Trump's alleged attempt to \"cook the books\" to repay Mr Cohen.\n\nOutside the courthouse Robert De Niro, the actor and long-standing critic of Mr Trump, held an impromptu press conference on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nSpeaking next to a group of Mr Trump's supporters, DeNiro described Mr Trump as a \"clown\" and a \"tyrant\", adding: \"This is the time to stop him.\"\n\nMr Trump's oldest sons, Donald Jr and Eric, also addressed the crowds outside, describing the court proceedings as an \"abomination\", and \"legal warfare\".\n\nIn court, Mr Blanche told the jury: \"President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period.\"\n\nThe lawyer repeatedly locked eyes with jurors and shouted that Mr Cohen was a liar and a thief.\n\n\"He's the human embodiment of reasonable doubt,\" he said. \"He lies constantly. He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.\"\n\nLater, he added that Mr Cohen was \"the GLOAT... literally the greatest liar of all time\".\n\nMr Blanche became impassioned as he revisited his Perry Mason moment of the trial - when he attempted to unravel Mr Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Mr Trump by phone about the arrangement with Ms Daniels on Oct 24.\n\nMr Cohen said he had contacted Mr Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Mr Trump, but Mr Blanche asserted that at the time Mr Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls from a teenager.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Mr Blanche shouted. \"That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nDuring his closing arguments for the prosecution, Mr Steinglass defended Mr Cohen's credibility, describing him as the \"ultimate insider\".\n\n\"The question is not whether you like Michael Cohen or whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen\", he said. \"The truth is he was in the best position to know... because he was at the defendant's right hand.\"\n\nHe also responded to the defence's attacks on Ms Daniels as an extortionist who wanted to cash in on the fallout from the infamous Access Hollywood tape.\n\nMr Steinglass said her sometimes \"cringeworthy\" testimony about the sexual encounter she claims took place was vital because it \"only reinforces his incentive to buy her silence\".\n\n\"Her story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that's kind of the point,\" Mr Steinglass said.\"In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the jury is expected to begin its deliberations to decide whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee just months before the 2024 election.\n\nMr Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denies ever having a sexual encounter with Ms Daniels.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score":

Merchan gave the instructions after scolding Blanche before the break over the remark made near the end of the defense's summation.\n\nPROSECUTION BEGINS ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nDEFENSE IMPLORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2\u00bd hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4\u00bd hours.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Merchan gave the instructions after scolding Blanche before the break over the remark made near the end of the defense's summation.\n\nPROSECUTION BEGINS ITS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun delivering his closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial. He speaks from the same podium that Blanche used, looking directly at jurors from a position between the prosecution and defense tables.\n\n\"This case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\" Steinglass said as he began.\n\nProsecutors have presented \"powerful evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" he said.\n\nAs he continued, Trump sat at the defense table with his body angled toward Steinglass, listening as Steinglass spoke.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTRUMP'S KIDS HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's children held a news conference outside the courthouse during a lunch break in his hush money trial, with Donald Trump Jr. echoing defense lawyer Todd Blanche and calling Michael Cohen \"the GOAT (greatest of all time) of liars.\"\n\nHe said the Biden campaign holding a news conference at the trial showed the case was a \"political persecution\" and in using one of his father's frequent terms, called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\n\"This is a sham. This is insane. It needs to stop,\" he said.\n\nHis brother Eric Trump decried \"political warfare\" and said his father is the \"toughest man I've ever seen\" and \"he endures this nonsense every single day.\"\n\n\"I want to say sorry to the jury that's in there. This has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\" he said.\n\nLara Trump, Eric Trump's wife and the Republican National Committee co-chair, said that Alvin Bragg, the top law enforcement officer in New York, was focusing on her father-in-law instead of crime in New York.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"If they can profit off it on the other side, so can we,\" she said, and plugged Trump's campaign website where donations can be accepted.\n\nSTEINGLASS TAKES ISSUE WITH 'RIDICULOUS COMMENT' FROM DEFENSE\n\nBefore an afternoon lunch break, the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial scolded defense lawyer Todd Blanche for imploring jurors not to send Trump to prison on the words of Michael Cohen and said he would instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass had taken issue with what he cast as a \"ridiculous comment\" and asked the judge to intervene.\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Judge Juan M. Merchan scolded Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nIf Trump is convicted, sentencing will be up to the judge, not the jury.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDEFENSE IMPL\n\nORES JURY TO RETURN A 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICT\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche finished his summation Tuesday by telling jurors the hush money case \"isn't a referendum on your views of President Trump.\"\n\n\"This is not a referendum on the ballot box -- who you voted for in 2016 or 2020, who you plan on voting for in 2024. That is not what this is about,\" the attorney told jurors. \"The verdict you have to reach has to do with the evidence you heard in this courtroom,\" and nothing else, he reminds them.\n\nHe implored the jury to return a quick \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nBLANCHE CALLS COHEN 'AN MVP OF LIARS'\n\nAs he neared the end of his summation on Tuesday, defense lawyer Todd Blanche reminded jurors of Michael Cohen's admitted fixation on Donald Trump -- and his desire to see him behind bars.\n\nBlanche played short clips of Cohen's podcast in which he commended District Attorney Alvin Bragg and said that the idea of seeing the former president booked on criminal charges \"fills me with delight.\"\n\nThe case against Trump is built around testimony from \"a witness that outright hates the defendant, wants him in jail, is actively making money off that hatred,\" Blanche said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhile Cohen has testified that he lied to protect Trump, his family and others, Blanche asserted that the ex-lawyer \"is lying simply to protect Michael Cohen and nobody else. Period.\"\n\nBlanche's voice grew to a roar -- the loudest he had been all morning -- as he also declared that Cohen had lied about speaking to Trump by phone about the Stormy Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\n\"It was a lie,\" Blanche said. \"That was a lie and he got caught red-handed.\"\n\nBlanche called Cohen \"literally like an MVP of liars.\"\n\n\"He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates,\" he said.\n\nDEFENSE SHARPENS CRITIQUE OF 'CATCH AND KILLS'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche on Tuesday questioned the prosecution's narrative that the Stormy Daniels payment in October 2016 was part of a conspiracy amongst Trump, Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to suppress negative stories about the then-candidate through the practice known as \"catch and kill.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCohen had known about Daniels' claim since it was published without her permission on a gossip website in 2011, Blanche said, adding that Daniels had authorized her manager to seek offers to sell the story in early 2016.\n\n\"Why did it not go anywhere for months and months and months if there was a catch-and-kill scheme?\" Blanche asked.\n\nCohen agreed to pay Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, after the leak of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nBlanche reminded jurors of the two other stories prosecutors say were buried through \"catch and kill.\"\n\nThe National Enquirer paid $30,000 for a since-disproven rumor from a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her claim of an affair with Trump, though publisher David Pecker testified the tabloid wasn't interested in pursuing her story at first because it couldn't be corroborated.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPecker said he refused to pay Daniels because he didn't want to shell out any more money for Trump without getting repaid, leaving Cohen to make the deal himself.\n\nBlanche suggested the publisher didn't want anything to do with the story anyway.\n\n\"That's our conspiracy? That's the three catch and kills?\" Blanche said.\n\nDEFENSE TRIES TO DOWNPLAY 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE\n\nLawyer Todd Blanche tried on Tuesday to downplay the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent Donald Trump's 2016 campaign into a tailspin, telling the jury: \"It was not a doomsday event.\"\n\nBlanche conceded in his summation that Trump was bothered by the story. \"Nobody wants their family to be subjected to that type of thing,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you're running for office, if you're running 'The Apprentice' ... Nobody wants their family exposed to that type of story.\"\n\nNonetheless, he argued characterizations of the tape as devastating were an exaggeration. He pointed to testimony from Trump's former assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whom he said cast the fallout as \"a couple of days of frustration and consternation.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWesterhout, who was then working for the Republican National Committee in close coordination with the Trump campaign, had testified that the tape \"rattled the RNC leadership\" but that Trump wasn't thrown by it.\n\nReince Priebus, then-chair of the Republican National Committee, had told Trump after the tape was released that he had two choices: drop out of the race or lose by the largest margin in history, Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon has recounted.\n\nBLANCHE ARGUES 'PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW' ABOUT DANIELS' CLAIMS\n\nTurning to Stormy Daniels' story, defense lawyer Todd Blanche noted in his summation that her allegations of a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump were aired on a gossip site in 2011 -- four years before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.\n\n\"So how could this issue have influenced the election?\" Blanche argued. \"People already knew about the allegations.\"\n\nAt the behest of Daniels and Michael Cohen, the story was taken off the site.\n\nBlanche asserted that the real impetus behind Daniels' interest in making a deal in 2016 was that some people wanted to use the election as pressure to \"extort\" Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFollowing a brief morning break, Blanche singled out that Daniels issued two statements in 2018 denying that she'd ever had a sexual encounter with Trump. She testified earlier in the hush money trial that she signed off on them at her lawyer's urging.\n\nDEFENSE DENIES RECORDED CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT PAYOFF OF FORMER MODEL\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche spotlighted a key piece of prosecution evidence during his summation: the secret recording Michael Cohen says he made of himself briefing Donald Trump on a plan to buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story from the National Enquirer.\n\nBlanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and was actually about a plan to buy a collection of material on Trump that the National Enquirer had been hoarding -- not McDougal. Cohen has said the audio cut off because the iPhone he was using to make the recording was receiving a phone call.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this recording discussed AMI and discussed Mr. Pecker,\" Blanche said, referring to the National Enquirer's parent company and then-publisher. \"There is a lot of doubt that it discussed Karen McDougal.\"\n\nAfter playing parts of the recording, Blanche urged jurors to trust their ears when deciphering a specific part -- whether Trump mentioned a dollar figure that he might have to spend, as Cohen and prosecutors contend, or whether he said something else.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump said, according to Cohen and prosecutors, as in $150,000.\n\n\"Listen to the recording. See if you hear one-fifty,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN HOLDS ITS OWN NEWS CONFERENCE\n\nDonald Trump's campaign staffers held their own news conference outside the courthouse Tuesday morning in the exact same spot where actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 officers had just spoken on behalf of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nJason Miller, Trump's senior campaign advisor, called De Niro \"a washed-up actor,\" and said the news conference showed that the hush money trial was political.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the campaign press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said their event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBLANCHE: 'THIS WASN'T A CATCH AND KILL'\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's hush money trial took issue on Tuesday with the notion that there was a conspiracy to suppress negative stories to help Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to American Media Inc.'s $30,000 payment to Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman who falsely alleged the former president had fathered a child out of wedlock. It was one of three potentially damaging stories about Trump the tabloid did not run.\n\nBlanche then pointed to former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's testimony that he saw the doorman story as a potential blockbuster and would gladly have published it if it had been true.\n\n\"This isn't a catch and kill. This is an opportunity,\" Blanche said. \"It was worth too much to catch and kill, full stop.\"\n\nHe also noted Pecker had testified that the tabloid only published about half the stories they purchased.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"That's meaningful. That matters,\" Blanche told the jury.\n\nHe later targeted prosecutors' portrayal of Karen McDougal's deal with AMI as part of the purported hush money conspiracy, emphasizing testimony from her lawyer and others that she didn't want her claim published.\n\nRather, Blanche said, the former Playboy model wanted to reenergize her career by getting into magazines, according to the testimony -- though McDougal herself didn't testify.\n\n\"This was not a catch-and-kill,\" Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE URGES JURORS TO DISREGARD 'CONSPIRACY' CONCERNS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche implored the jury in Donald Trump's criminal trial to reject the prosecution's contention that he engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by involving himself in efforts to bury negative stories about him -- and to reject the allegation that, after the fact, he falsified records of Michael Cohen's payments to hide that conspiracy.\n\n\"The government wants you to believe that President Trump did these things with his records to conceal efforts to promote his successful candidacy in 2016, the year before,\" Blanche said.\n\n\"Even that, even if you find that is true, that is not enough ... it doesn't matter if there's a conspiracy to win an election. Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDEFENSE SAYS TRUMP WATCHES HIS FINANCE CAREFULLY\n\nAfter arguing earlier Tuesday that Donald Trump may not have been fully aware of all his invoices, defense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed to jurors that the former president was a stickler about watching his finances.\n\nMichael Cohen received $420,000 in all from Trump in 2017, a sum that the ex-lawyer and prosecutors in the former president's hush money case have said included the $130,000 reimbursement related to Stormy Daniels, a $50,000 repayment for an unrelated expense and a $60,000 bonus. On top of that, prosecutors have said, there was extra money to cover taxes that would be due on the $130,000 as income -- taxes that wouldn't apply if it had simply been paid as a business expense reimbursement.\n\n\"That is absurd,\" Blanche told jurors, pointing to \"all the other evidence you heard about how carefully President Trump watches his finances.\"\n\nACTOR ROBERT DE NIRO AND JAN. 6 FIRST RESPONDERS SPEAK NEAR TRUMP'S TRIAL\n\nBiden campaign deploys actor Robert De Niro, Jan. 6 first responders near Trump's trial\n\nJoe Biden's campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and two law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an area in lower Manhattan not far from the criminal court where Donald Trump's hush money trial is happening.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSpeaking while the former president was stuck in court, De Niro said Trump wants to \"destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Trump protesters screamed anti-Biden chants.\n\nTRUMP WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHEN SIGNING CHECKS, BLANCHE SAYS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche stressed during his summation on Tuesday that Donald Trump was busy during the time when he signed the checks at the heart of the hush money case.\n\n\"It matters where President Trump was,\" Blanche said.\n\nHe noted Trump assistant Madeleine Westerhout had testified that the then-president would sometimes sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.\n\nBlanche argued it was unreasonable to suggest Trump was aware of the details of every invoice just because he knew of some. \"That is a stretch and that is reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\nBLANCHE CRITICIZES PROSECUTIONS USE OF TRUMP'S BOOKS AND MORE\n\nAbout an hour into the defense's closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche took aim at the prosecution's use of excerpts from Trump's books to attempt to portray him as a detail-oriented micromanager who would be fully aware of any money his company was spending.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe books were from a decade ago, if not older, and were written with the help of ghostwriters, Blanche told the jury.\n\n\"You should be suspicious. That's a red flag,\" Blanche said in an effort to pre-empt the prosecution's closing.\n\nBlanche then started digging into the details of how payments to Michael Cohen were made, first through a trust set up to hold Trump's assets while he was in the White House, then through Trump's personal bank account with checks signed by the then-president.\n\n\"This was a very confusing time for the Trump Organization,\" Blanche said. There were a lot of adjustments being made as Trump's assets were put under the trust's control and it was the first time in decades that Trump wasn't in charge, he added.\n\nAt one point, early in the repayment process in 2017, the then-Trump Organization finance chief emailed a subordinate that it was OK to pay Cohen out of the trust per an agreement with Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., who were running the Trump Organization's day-to-day operations at the time. Both were in court on Tuesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche questioned why, if prosecutors allege Trump was involved in a conspiracy to conceal the nature of the payments, the sons he put in charge of his company weren't called to the witness stand.\n\nCOHEN WAS TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, BLANCHE REITERATES\n\nA key part of prosecutors' claims in Donald Trump's hush money case is that his former lawyer Michael Cohen wasn't being paid for legal work in 2017, but rather was being reimbursed in a veiled way for the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to emails and testimony Tuesday showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.\n\nWhile Cohen characterized that work as \"very minimal,\" Blanche argued otherwise.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you. Cohen lied to you,\" Blanche said, his voice getting more emphatic.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen went on TV to discuss his role as Trump's personal lawyer and put the title in the signature block of every email he sent.\n\n\"This was not a secret. Michael Cohen was President Trump's personal attorney. Period,\" he said.\n\nBIDEN AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNS HOLD DUELING NEWS CONFERENCES OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE\n\nJoe Biden's campaign announced on Tuesday that it would hold an event with \"special guests\" as closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are underway.\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president's allies will respond with their own event immediately following Biden's.\n\nHe posted on the social platform X that Biden's allies \"aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA -- they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" adding: \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPOWERPOINT CLOSING\n\nThe defense in Donald Trump's criminal trial is using a PowerPoint presentation as it begins its summation and tries to convince the jury that the former president is not guilty, instead shifting blame to former lawyer Michael Cohen and the Trump Organization.\n\nTodd Blanche showed jurors copies of the invoices, vouchers and checks that are at the heart of the hush money case -- vouchers and checks he says were entered and prepared by the Trump Organization's accounting department.\n\nThe PowerPoint also notes Cohen sent the invoices for his services. None of the invoices were sent directly to Trump, Blanche said.\n\nBLANCHE TAKES AIM AT COHEN'S TESTIMONY\n\nInsisting that prosecutors haven't proven their case, defense lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors during closing arguments Tuesday morning that they \"should want and expect more\" than key prosecution witness Michael Cohen's testimony, or that of a Trump Organization employee accounts payable staffer talking about how she processed invoices, or the testimony given by Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson.\n\nBlanche argued that Davidson \"was really just trying to extort money from President Trump\" in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The consequences of the lack of proof that you all heard over the past five weeks is simple: is a not guilty verdict, period,\" Blanche said.\n\nBlanche further laid into Cohen and his testimony, telling jurors he'll come up repeatedly throughout the defense's summation.\n\n\"You're going to hear me talk a lot about Michael Cohen, and for good reason. You can not convict President Trump, you can not convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said. Cohen \"told you a number of things that were lies, pure and simple,\" the lawyer added.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche began his closing argument Tuesday morning by telling jurors that Donald Trump \"is innocent\" of the charges against him.\n\n\"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof. Period,\" Blanche said before adding that evidence in the case \"should leave you wanting.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This case is about documents. It's a paper case. This case is not about an encounter with Stormy Daniels 18 years ago, an encounter that President Trump has unequivocally and repeatedly denied ever occurred,\" Blanche said. \"Nor is it about the confidential settlement and non-disclosure agreement that Daniels entered into eight years ago.\"\n\nMERCHAN EXPLAINS CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROCESS\n\nJurors in Donald Trump's criminal trial were attentive Tuesday morning as Judge Juan M. Merchan explained the closing arguments process -- that by law the defense must go first and prosecutors must go last.\n\nMerchan says he'll leave it up to the jury if they want to work past 4:30 p.m., the normal end of the court day, to accommodate both summations in their entirety, rather than spilling into Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche said he expects to speak for about 2 1/2 hours during the defense's part of closing arguments while prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he may go as long as 4 1/2 hours.\n\nTRUMP: IT'S 'A DARK DAY IN AMERICA'\n\nDonald Trump spoke to reporters before heading into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, calling it \"a dark day in America\" and \"a very sad day.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.", "source": {"uri":

"Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sits in court during his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City. -- AFP\n\nNEW YORK: Donald Trump arrived on Tuesday for closing arguments in his New York hush money trial ahead of the jury deciding whether to make him the first criminally convicted former president and current White House hopeful in history.\n\nThe defence team to start off, seeking to persuade the jury that the Republican committed no crime when he paid to bury a news story on the eve of his shock 2016 election win about an alleged encounter with Stormy Daniels.\n\nProsecutors will lay out the case that Trump falsified business records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will then start deliberations as early as Wednesday, with a guilty verdict potentially triggering a prison sentence.\n\nComing less than six months before the November presidential election, in which polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden, the verdict will mark a new moment of extreme tension in an already unprecedented contest.\n\nTrump, 77, is already the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election in which he lost to Biden.\n\nThe New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have been completed, or even come to trial, by November 5 election day.\n\nIf convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.\n\nTrump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not in any case bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.\n\nAs expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defence -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination.\n\nInstead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail and his once close personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen took the stand as star prosecution witness. -- AFP", "source": {"uri":

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS?\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments.\n\nThe arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Donald Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Justin Lane - Pool/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump is not behaving like someone who expects to be found \"not guilty.\" In a series of posts over the Memorial Day weekend, the former president deviated from the norm of honoring soldiers who fought and died for the United States by instead posting on his website, Truth Social, about how unfair it is that standard courtroom procedures are not being bent in his favor.\n\nPosting in all caps, Trump - facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush payment to an adult film star - on Monday raged against the order in which closing arguments will be made in his Manhattan trial. It is a \"big advantage,\" he said, and \"very unfair\" that the prosecution gets to go second. \"Why can't the defense go last?\"\n\nWhether he knows this and is just riling up gullible followers or if he simply never retained the information his defense counsel could surely provide, Politico's Kyle Cheney noted that Trump is here complaining about a fact of life \"in virtually every criminal court.\" Per Cheney, \"Prosecutors typically get a rebuttal during closings because [the] burden or proof lies with them, not [the] defense.\"\n\nTrump, then, is complaining about an order that exists because of the far higher standard that prosecutors must meet. The defense only needs to sow doubt about the government's case, and it really only needs one juror to entertain the former president's argument that the case is a \"witch hunt\"; the prosecution must show that its case is not just probable, but prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"Trump is finally being treated like every other defendant,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney who has been following his hush money trial. \"[R]eally,\" she argued, \"that's what he objects to.\"\n\nIn another weekend rant about the case, Trump again opined that it was wrong to bring a case against him while he's running for president. If there was evidence of a crime, he wrote, referring to himself in the third person, \"it should have been brought seven years ago, not in the middle of his Campaign for President.\"\n\nThat Trump was not charged years ago is indeed curious. In 2018, while Trump was president, his former fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison in part for his role in a criminal conspiracy. As the Department of Justice stated in a press release at the time, Cohen made payments \"to silence two women\" - Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels - \"who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election.\" The indictment of Cohen states that he did so in coordination with the Trump campaign, discussing \"the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.\"\n\nTrump was not himself charged at the time for a number of reasons, chief among them: He was president of the United States and, after the Cohen case, appointed an attorney general, William Barr, who purged the Department of Justice, forcing out the prosecutor who had brought the charges against his ex-attorney and replacing him with a Trump loyalist.\n\nSince Trump is no longer president, and can no longer pick those charged with enforcing the law, he is now just another man who must stand before and be judged by it. For a man who has long enjoyed impunity, it is intolerable. And while he may be able to evade financial penalties, at least for a time, in this case his actual liberty is at stake: it is not inconceivable that, when closing arguments conclude this week, jurors return a guilty verdict and Judge Juan Merchan decides that this particular defendant deserves some time behind bars.\n\nGeorge Conway, a conservative attorney turned harsh critic of the former president, believes Trump is reacting to his loss of control. \"The defendant,\" he posted on Threads, \"is clearly in full panic mode.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Blanche has also emphasized to the jury that Trump used to be an American president, seeming to convey not just that he was busy, but that jurors should think twice before convicting someone of such stature\n\nRather than rely solely on spoken words, Blanche leaned on a PowerPoint presentation, with one key slide titled \"No Election 'Influence,'\" CNN reported. He insisted that the bottom line of the case is quite unrelated to the alleged tryst with Stormy Daniels or the hush money payments, but whether Trump. \"while he was living in the White House and was the leader of the free world,\" had a hand in the financial documents processed by the Trump Organization.\n\nPart of Blanche's strategy is to also drive home the fact that Cohen is untrustworthy and a liar. \"He's literally like the MVP of liars,\" Blanche said, NBC reported.\n\nUltimately, Blanche argued that this was a case of Cohen doing his own thing, of his own accord, continuing to insist - despite documents suggesting otherwise - that the former president's ex-fixer was being paid for his legal services, not his efforts to silence women on Trump's behalf.\n\n\"Blanche is making a classic horses, not zebras argument, saying that the simplest explanation of behavior is usually the right one, as he argues that Cohen was simply being paid for legal work, not repayment for a cover-up scheme,\" The New York Times reported.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/donald_trump_todd_blanche_2154501694.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies the affair. Despite the structure of the falsified records charges, he has not been charged with any other crimes.\n\nHere is what to know as closing arguments in the historic first criminal trial against a former president begin.\n\nClosing arguments\n\nOn Tuesday, both Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys will present their closing arguments, providing a summary of the key points they presented throughout the roughly four weeks of testimony. These arguments are not evidence but will serve to reinforce their narratives to the jury. Prosecutors will likely emphasize the credibility of the Trump Organization's financial documents and testimony from key witnesses, including Daniels and Michael Cohen, who implicated Trump in the hush money payments.\n\nThe closing arguments come after the 12-member jury, which has six alternates, took a weeklong break from the trial beginning last Tuesday and extending through Memorial Day. Trump attorney Alina Habba argued on Monday that the jury should have been sequestered over concerns that the long break and conversations with peers could influence their decisions.\n\n\"And for them to be able to be out and about on a holiday weekend with friends and families who have opinions, who are watching the news, TVs in the background at the pool party, I have serious concerns. If they're left-wing and they're watching MSDNC, as my client calls it, [MSNBC] or CNN, they're not going to get fair news,\" Habba told Fox News.\n\nDefense strategy\n\nThe defense, having called only two witnesses and not Trump, needs to instill reasonable doubt in at least one juror to avoid a conviction. They are expected to challenge Daniels's testimony and Cohen's credibility, arguing that Trump's primary concern was protecting his family, not influencing the election.\n\nSome lawyers have said Trump's team will need to present an argument \"that raises reasonable doubt,\" according to attorney George Conway, who told MSNBC on Saturday that he believes it would be the way for Trump to gain a full acquittal.\n\n\"I think their best shot, and that's what they're gonna do, is hope that there's just some person on the jury who just refuses to convict,\" Conway said.\n\nBut other legal experts said Trump's legal team, led by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles, and Emil Bove, might flag to the jury that the prosecution's key witness never took the stand. That witness is Allen Weisselberg, the former Trump Organization chief financial officer who, prosecutors say, was in a room with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower when they worked out the details of what Bragg's team described as a conspiracy.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nWeisselberg was never called to the stand in part because he is serving time for a crime that began with him making false statements in a court of law. He was sentenced to five months in Rikers Island after pleading guilty to perjury in an unrelated civil case involving Trump, a man with whom he worked for nearly 50 years.\n\nProsecutors likely thought Weisselberg's testimony could damage their case further, given that Cohen has a past of inconsistent testimony. Trump lawyers also did not choose him to call the longtime CFO to the stand. It's not clear if Weisselberg would have confirmed Cohen's version of events had he been called to testify.\n\nThe defense \"just needs to point out the failures to prove and failures to call relevant witnesses that might have had information that could give the jury more to think about,\" attorney Katie Cherkasky told the Washington Examiner earlier this month.\n\nJudge's instructions\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan will instruct the jurors on the legal standards they must follow before they decide on the verdict. This step, possibly happening on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning, is crucial because it guides the jury on what to consider during deliberations.\n\nJury deliberations\n\nThe jury will then deliberate in private, evaluating 34 counts of falsifying business records. This process is confidential and can vary in length. Jurors may request clarifications or testimony excerpts, but the exact nature of their discussions is unknown.\n\nThere are also two lawyers on the jury, a rather uncommon occurrence after a thorough jury selection process. Some lawyers have said the pair of attorneys on the jury could take on a \"strong leadership position\" that could affect the votes of the other 10 members.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPossible outcomes\n\nA unanimous decision is required for a verdict on each count of business falsifications made between February and December of 2017. If the jury cannot reach a consensus, Merchan may instruct them to continue deliberating. Persistent deadlock could lead to a mistrial declaration.\n\nThe coming days are pivotal in determining the outcome of this landmark case, with each step bringing it closer to resolution.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Daughter Ivanka Trump and wife Melania Trump have yet to make an appearance in court. The lack of family members at the criminal trial aside from Eric Trump has been striking to legal experts, who have noted criminal defendants typically have their family present at their trial.\n\nWhile attending the trial as press and not part of the ex-president's entourage, several Trump-friendly media personalities have also been spotted in court, including Fox host Jeanine Pirro, whom Trump acknowledged in court on May 10, and Newsmax host Greg Kelly, who reportedly stood up and gave Trump a thumbs up in court on May 9.\n\nHow Trump's trial entourage affects the fight to become his running mate. A number of politicians who are showing up at the trial are also considered to be vice presidential contenders, including Scott, Vance, Burgum and Ramaswamy -- though it remains to be seen if appearing in the courtroom will help any of them curry enough favor with the ex-president to clinch the spot on Trump's ticket.\n\nWhile the Times reports that Trump's advisors are behind the rotating group of politicians accompanying Trump to the trial, the ex-president told reporters on May 13 that he was urging Republicans to stay home. \"We have a lot of them, they want to come, and I say just stay back and pass lots of laws to stop things like this,\" Trump said as he continued to decry the legal case against him, though he told reporters the following day his surrogates at the trial were \"speaking very beautifully\" about him.\n\nSome of the politicians who have appeared at Trump's trial have made comments that Trump is barred from making under the gag order against him -- namely criticizing Judge Juan Merchan's daughter, who Trump has accused of being biased against him because she does work for Democratic politicians. That's raised concerns among legal experts that Trump could be using his allies -- whom he termed his \"surrogates\" on Tuesday -- to speak on his behalf, which could violate the gag order's terms. The gag order prohibits Trump from speaking out against various people involved with the trial, or directing others to, though the Times notes it's unlikely Merchan could say Trump violated the gag order unless there was clear evidence he directed people to speak for him.\n\nSome Republicans' appearances at the trial have drawn criticism, as Democrats have accused politicians of appearing at the trial solely to further their own political careers. \"Iowans deserve to know whether their hard-earned money is going to a political photo op 1,100 miles from the State Capitol,\" Iowa Democratic Party chair Rita Hart said in a statement Monday about Bird showing up in court. \"Iowans deserve an attorney general that's focused on serving her constituents -- not her political ambitions.\" Former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., also took aim at Johnson for going to court on Tuesday, tweeting she \"[has] to admit I'm surprised that [Johnson] wants to be in the 'I cheated on my wife with a porn star' club.\" (Trump has denied allegations of an affair with Stormy Daniels.)\n\nTrump is on trial for 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, stemming from reimbursement checks he paid to Cohen after his ex-attorney paid Daniels $130,000 right before the 2016 election to cover up allegations of an affair. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and has decried the trial as a \"witch hunt,\" also complaining about the legal proceedings -- which, as a criminal defendant, Trump is required to be at -- taking away his ability to campaign. Daniels and Cohen were the most high profile witnesses to take the stand at the trial, which began in mid-April, with both testifying negatively about the ex-president. Daniels told the jury about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump -- saying she \"blacked out\" during the episode, though she wasn't drugged, and wanted to get out of there \"as fast as I could\" -- while Cohen testified Trump had direct knowledge of and involvement in the hush money scheme. Trump is barred under a gag order from speaking out against witnesses, the jury, and other participants in the case, but the judge has ruled he violated the order 10 times.", "source": {"uri":

I feel like he was being sympathetic to me. Ivanka's beautiful and she's blonde and I'm sure she's had people assume she's an idiot.\n\n'But I felt like as this father figure who has watched his daughter be treated a certain way [he] could identify with me. I thought we had this mutual respect.'\n\nIn a candid interview which mirrors her testimony against the former US president, the adult film star recounts how she was initially at ease with Trump\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump sits at the defendant's table during his criminal trial at the New York State Supreme Court in New York, New York, USA, 28 May 2024\n\nDaniels says she and Trump discussed his daughter Ivanka, who had a prominent role on NBC's The Apprentice\n\nShe went on to say that this 'mutual respect' was 'why it was so crazy when having no red flags whatsoever in a conversation I came out of the bathroom to find myself cornered.\n\n'I don't remember how I got on the bed. It was awful. But I didn't say no.\n\nShe later said she wishes she had said 'no'. 'I told very few people that we had actually had sex,' she testified. 'I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no.'\n\nDaniels said again during the trial that Trump told her in his hotel suite: 'You remind me of my daughter, she is smart, people underestimate her as well.'\n\nDuring their meeting, Daniels said that Trump also dangled a potential cameo for the porn star in The Apprentice after she got introduced to him as a film 'director.'\n\nThat was one reason she said she kept in touch with Trump even after the encounter she said rattled her, the court was told.\n\nIn the documentary, which is airing on Channel 5 tonight, Daniels tells the interviewer that their initial encounter had been pleasant.\n\n'Did I get any bad vibes or sexual innuendos? Nothing. He said: \"You're actually really smart\".\n\nTrump raises his fist as he walks back into the courtroom after a break during closing arguments in his hush money trial at Manhattan criminal court in New York\n\n'Somehow the conversation about Celebrity Apprentice came up, and his argument was \"I will get a lot of attention for putting this blonde adult actress on TV\".\n\n'And I was like \"NBC will never let me on television!\" And he's like 'every season I get to pick one person that they can't overrule, it's my wild card.\n\n'So he spun it to me as 'You want to be a mainstream director... well this is a chance for you to be on TV and show people that you're not just what you look like.'\n\nThe documentary - titled Stormy - is directed by Sarah Gibson, and poses the question: 'What happens when you take on the most powerful man in the world?'\n\nIt is airing to UK audiences at the same time as closing arguments are taking place across the pond in Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys have one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin.\n\nJurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former US president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that may have wrecked his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was given to Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nTrump listens as defense lawyer Todd Blanche presents closing arguments during a criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as 'legal expenses' to hide the true nature of the transactions. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

That's how much Trump leads Biden by nationally, according to RealClearPolitics' poll tracker. On the same day in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Biden was up 5.3 points.\n\nClosing arguments opened Tuesday in Trump's Manhattan hush money case, which charges him with 34 felony counts of falsifying records of reimbursements made to his former lawyer Michael Cohen for the payments Cohen allegedly made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an affair she said she had with Trump. Prosecutors claim Trump committed the crime, which is typically a misdemeanor, in order to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race in his favor. Jurors have heard direct testimony from both Daniels and Cohen, who claimed Trump was directly involved in the scheme and knew the reimbursements were fraudulently recorded as legal services. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges, denied the affair allegations and claimed, without evidence, the charges were brought at Biden's behest to help improve his chances of winning in November.\n\nBiden's campaign held a press conference outside Trump's trial Tuesday after largely avoiding any mentions of Trump's legal woes in an apparent effort to avoid accusations it was attempting to influence the outcome of the cases.

The trial, rooted in allegations of hush-money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, now moves toward its conclusion as closing arguments are delivered. With closing arguments scheduled to begin Tuesday and the jury set to start deliberating soon after, the nation waits anxiously to see the outcome of this landmark case.\n\nWhat Happens With a Guilty Verdict?\n\nA guilty verdict would have enormous implications. Though Trump has been free on bail throughout the trial, a guilty decision would still permit him to leave the courthouse as a free man, pending a sentencing hearing scheduled by Justice Juan Merchan. Factors like Trump's age, his lack of previous convictions, and potential violations of court gag orders could influence the judge's sentencing decision. Penalties could range from a fine, probation, or supervision, to potentially prison time.\n\nYet, Trump's legal team is almost certain to appeal a guilty verdict, which could drag the case out for months or even years. These appeals would ascend through the legal system, likely moving from Manhattan's Appellate Division to the Court of Appeals. This protracted process makes it highly unlikely that Trump would immediately find himself in handcuffs.\n\nGrounds for Appeal\n\nSeveral potential grounds for appeal could emerge. The testimony of Stormy Daniels, laden with detailed accounts of her alleged encounter with Trump, is a likely candidate. Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School, noted the pros and cons of such detailed testimony. \"On the one hand, her detail makes her credible and as a prosecutor, you want to provide enough detail so the jury believes what she has to say. On the other hand, there's a line, where it could become irrelevant and prejudicial,\" she said.\n\nTrump's defense team has twice called for a mistrial during Daniels' testimony, though these motions were denied. The novel legal strategy by the District Attorney could also be contentious. Normally, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York; Trump faces more severe felony charges because of an alleged second crime violating federal and state election laws. Legal experts question whether the Manhattan District Attorney has the jurisdiction to invoke an uncharged federal crime, thus creating additional grounds for appeal.\n\nCould Trump Go to Prison?\n\nWhile it's possible that Trump could serve prison time, it's highly improbable. The 34 charges he faces are Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York State, each carrying a maximum sentence of four years. Judge Merchan might lean towards a lesser punishment, considering Trump's age, lack of previous criminal record, and the non-violent nature of the crime.\n\nRunning a prison system with a former president in custody presents its own complications. Trump is entitled to lifelong Secret Service protection, meaning agents would have to safeguard him in prison. This would be both a logistical and financial burden. Justin Paperny, director of the prison consulting firm White Collar Advice, summarized it succinctly: \"It would be a freak show... no warden would allow it.\"\n\nCould He Still Run for President?\n\nIncredibly, yes. The U.S. Constitution imposes minimal eligibility requirements for presidential candidates: they must be at least 35 years old, a natural-born U.S. citizen, and have lived in the U.S. for at least 14 years. A criminal record does not automatically disqualify a candidate. However, public sentiment could shift significantly if Trump is convicted. According to a poll from Bloomberg and Morning Consult, 53% of voters in key swing states would refuse to vote for Trump if convicted.\n\nCould He Pardon Himself?\n\nNo, Trump could not pardon himself in this scenario. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, and the hush-money case is a state matter. This jurisdictional nuance would prevent Trump from issuing a self-pardon even if he returned to the White House. Similar constraints apply to his legal troubles in Georgia, where he faces accusations of attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. For his federal cases involving the mishandling of classified documents and conspiring to subvert the 2020 election, the constitutional debate over whether a sitting president can pardon himself remains unsettled.\n\nWitnesses and Testimonies\n\nThe trial featured a range of testimonies from individuals closely associated with Trump. Key witnesses included Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, who admitted to orchestrating payments to Daniels. David Pecker, the former head of American Media Inc., and longtime Trump assistant Rhona Graff provided crucial testimonies linking Trump to the payments. Former Trump Organization comptroller Jeffrey McConney and Trump Organization employee Rebecca Manochio provided details about the mechanics of the payments.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass took a strong stance during closing statements, addressing inconsistencies in the defense's portrayal of Cohen. Steinglass accused Cohen of monetary wrongdoing but emphasized that he was the only one facing consequences within this scheme involving Trump. As he deftly summarized, \"He made his bed, but you can hardly blame him for making money on the one thing he has left which is his knowledge of the Trump phenomenon.\"\n\nInformation Box\n\n- Charges**: 34 counts of falsifying business records, potentially tied to a second crime relating to election law violations.\n\n- Maximum Penalty**: Each charge carries a maximum of four years in prison, though a sentence could also include fines or probation.\n\n- Potential for Appeal**: High, likely citing issues with the scope of testimony and novel legal strategy of the prosecution.\n\n- Witnesses**: Key figures include Michael Cohen, David Pecker, Rhona Graff, Jeffrey McConney, and Stormy Daniels.\n\n- Public Sentiment**: Polls show significant voter resistance to a convicted candidate.\n\n- Legal Quagmire**: Jurisdictional challenges and the peculiarities of a former president's secret service protection compound the issue.\n\nAs the jury gears up to deliberate, millions of eyes are fixed on this unprecedented trial and its possible ramifications for the American political landscape. Whether Trump will face conviction, appeal, or ultimately remain central to the next presidential race remains an open question. In any case, the conclusion of this hush-money trial will undeniably leave a significant mark on U.S. history.\n\nReferences\n\nReference 1: BBC: What happens if Trump is convicted in hush-money

At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 (\u00a3101,750) hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nTrump, who has denied all wrongdoing, launched a rant ahead of the closing arguments. He wrote on his Truth Social platform, in capital letters: \"Why is the corrupt government allowed to make the final argument in the case against me? Why can't the defence go last? Big advantage, very unfair. Witch hunt! DJT.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump's confidence takes a hit as he sends 'warning signal' to crowd booing him\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday. The prosecution went first in opening statements but will deliver its closing arguments last because it has the burden of proof.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defence simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors have not proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. New York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nIt comes as an expert warned Trump's behaviour during the trial may have left the jury \"very offended\". Judge Merchan found Trump repeatedly violated limited gag orders imposed on the case after the Republican presidential frontrunner spoke out about trial witnesses and jurors. Professor Gregory Germain, Professor of Law at Syracuse University, said: \"I doubt that there are any Trump supporters on the jury, and I think they are likely very offended by Trump's conduct in and out of court, and with the unethical behaviour.\n\n\"So, even though only one juror is necessary for Trump to obtain a mistrial, and even though it's a very flawed case, I predict that the jury will convict him.\" Despite this, the professor did highlight possible flaws in the prosecution's case.\n\nHe said: \"I think the DA and the Judge are fully invested in obtaining a conviction. I think the judge will gloss over the legal issues in the jury instructions to allow a conviction by defining the legal issue around the propriety of paying hush money rather than the legality of paying hush money and how that relates to the documents charges.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_instructions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury instructions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32907588.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Former-President-Donald-Trumps-Hush-Money-Trial-Continues-In-New-York.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It is a \"big advantage,\" he said, and \"very unfair\" that the prosecution gets to go second. \"Why can't the defense go last?\"\n\nWhether he knows this and is just riling up gullible followers or if he simply never retained the information his defense counsel could surely provide, Politico's Kyle Cheney noted that Trump is here complaining about a fact of life \"in virtually every criminal court.\" Per Cheney, \"Prosecutors typically get a rebuttal during closings because [the] burden or proof lies with them, not [the] defense.\"\n\nTrump, then, is complaining about an order that exists because of the far higher standard that prosecutors must meet. The defense only needs to sow doubt about the government's case, and it really only needs one juror to entertain the former president's argument that the case is a \"witch hunt\"; the prosecution must show that its case is not just probable, but prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"Trump is finally being treated like every other defendant,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney who has been following his hush money trial. \"[R]eally,\" she argued, \"that's what he objects to.\"\n\nIn another weekend rant about the case, Trump again opined that it was wrong to bring a case against him while he's running for president. If there was evidence of a crime, he wrote, referring to himself in the third person, \"it should have been brought seven years ago, not in the middle of his Campaign for President.\"\n\nThat Trump was not charged years ago is indeed curious. In 2018, while Trump was president, his former fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison in part for his role in a criminal conspiracy. As the Department of Justice stated in a press release at the time, Cohen made payments \"to silence two women\" - Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels - \"who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election.\" The indictment of Cohen states that he did so in coordination with the Trump campaign, discussing \"the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.\"\n\nTrump was not himself charged at the time for a number of reasons, chief among them: He was president of the United States and, after the Cohen case, appointed an attorney general, William Barr, who purged the Department of Justice, forcing out the prosecutor who had brought the charges against his ex-attorney and replacing him with a Trump loyalist.\n\nSince Trump is no longer president, and can no longer pick those charged with enforcing the law, he is now just another man who must stand before and be judged by it. For a man who has long enjoyed impunity, it is intolerable. And while he may be able to evade financial penalties, at least for a time, in this case his actual liberty is at stake: it is not inconceivable that, when closing arguments conclude this week, jurors return a guilty verdict and Judge Juan Merchan decides that this particular defendant deserves some time behind bars.\n\nGeorge Conway, a conservative attorney turned harsh critic of the former president, believes Trump is reacting to his loss of control. \"The defendant,\" he posted on Threads, \"is clearly in full panic mode.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was a rare sighting of Mr Trump's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, and her husband Michael Boulos. Meanwhile, former First Lady Melania Trump, Barron Trump, and Ivanka Trump have been conspicuously absent from the trial.\n\nMr Trump faces allegations that he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels issued just before the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an affair with Mr Trump that took place about a decade previously. Mr Trump has rejected that the affair ever took place and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe former president has called the case, and the 34 charges against him, a \"scam\" pushed by his political opponents to keep him away from the campaign trail.\n\nThe at-times salacious and provocative testimony in the trial went on for five weeks. The prosecution is now hoping that they will have convinced the 12-strong jury of Manhattan residents that the misdemeanor charges that Mr Trump faces should be converted to felonies because the supposedly unlawful actions were carried out in furtherance of another crime - namely to keep important information about then-candidate Trump from the electorate and thus subverting an election.\n\nTrump allies Steve Witkoff, Will Scharf, and Deroy Murdock were also seen at the court on Tuesday.\n\nA long line of Trump allies have made the trek to New York to support the former president, including congressional Republicans such as Reps Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Byron Donalds, and Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nOthers include running mate hopefuls such as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nAs he spoke in the hallway at the Manhattan Criminal Court before entering the courtroom, Mr Trump repeated his regular talking points, slamming Judge Juan Merchan as \"conflicted\" and corrupt. He also read from conservative opinion pieces from Jonathan Turley of Fox News and from Andy McCarthy.\n\n\"The judge never allows us anything,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"We had an election expert who was

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(SPENCER PLATT/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump returns today to a Manhattan courtroom where his attorneys are set to conclude their defense in the ex-president's election interference trial. Trump did not testify in his own defense.\n\nAs leading historian Heather Cox Richardson notes in her newsletter: \"Trump's refusal to take the stand encapsulates the MAGA approach to politics. Since the 2020 presidential election, he and his surrogates have made repeated accusations and statements about how the system is rigged against them and alleged there is evidence that proves them right. Crucially, they make those arguments only in front of television cameras or on podcasts and radio. They refuse to make them under oath in a court of law, where there are penalties for lying.\"\n\nDonald Trump's three other criminal trials have encountered significant delays. This means that the only chance to hold Trump somewhat responsible for his decades-long crime spree is a lurid hush-money trial. Public opinion polls and other research show that a guilty conviction in the hush-money trial (or the other three criminal trials) may sway enough Americans to either vote against or otherwise not support Trump in the 2024 election. Many legal experts have concluded that it is much more likely than not, given the extreme preponderance of the evidence and lacking quality of his defense, that Donald Trump will be found guilty in this first, and perhaps only, criminal trial.\n\nThat the future of America's multiracial democracy could ultimately be decided by a jury's decision in a hush-money trial, is a condemnation of America's political culture and larger society. Such a reality should cause all reasonable Americans a great amount of anxiety and concern about the future of their country and its democracy.\n\nUltimately, Donald Trump's criminal trial and possible conviction should not be celebrated. That the country elected such a man who was and is demonstrably unfit for the presidency (and who is trying to take back the White House and is now tied with President Biden in the early 2024 election polls) should be a source of national shame and embarrassment.\n\nIn an attempt to make better sense of Donald Trump's hush-money trial, what happens next with the jury and sentencing, if the much-discussed \"walls\" have finally closed in on Trump and how the corrupt ex-president is processing this reality, and the possibilities of violence by political cultists, I recently spoke with David Cay Johnston. He is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and bestselling author who teaches at Syracuse University College of Law, although he is not a lawyer. He has written three books about Donald Trump, who Johnston has covered for 36 years.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\nGiven your decades of experience with Donald Trump, how are you feeling given the imminent verdict in the hush-money trial, and the historic nature of these events more broadly? How are you making sense of this?\n\nDonald Trump hurt his own cause during his hush-money trial. Trump did much the same thing during the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial. Instead of accepting the advice of his counsel -- and there's a reason we refer to lawyers as \"counsel\" -- he told them what to do. You could see this in the cross-examinations of both Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. Instead of asking the questions that would hurt their claims and credibility in front of the jury and do some real damage, and then sitting down, Trump's attorneys went on and on and on. In the process, they created opportunities that were taken advantage of by both Daniels and Cohen to damage Donald Trump. Trump clearly ordered his attorneys to take that approach.\n\nIn my opinion, Donald Trump's conviction is as close to a certainty as you will ever get in a trial. I'm not surprised that he did not take the stand. Trump would never do that. His lawyers would have told him that it was suicide. And had Trump taken the stand and testified he would have absolutely talked himself straight into a conviction. His whole life is built on lies, and he can't keep those lies straight.\n\nWhat about your emotions?\n\nFor me, this is all professional. All I want to do is hold Trump responsible for what he has done. I don't really care about him personally. That's always been my attitude. I cover Donald Trump because 36 years ago, I realized that this guy is going to be a big force in American culture. I started building files on him and carefully covering him for long periods of time. My approach to Donald Trump is to expose and counter his myths with old school, solid, shoe-leather reporting.\n\nWhere are we with the narrative that the much-discussed \"walls\" are finally closing in on Donald Trump?\n\nIf Donald Trump is in fact convicted in the Manhattan criminal case as I expect will happen, we are going to see support for him drop in the polls. Much Trump polling support is soft. There are a lot of Americans who cannot stomach the notion of a convicted felon being president. But at this same time, it's become very clear -- to the point that even Utah Senator Mitt Romney is saying this -- that a large segment of the Republican Party doesn't believe in democracy, and they're perfectly happy to live under a dictatorship. Now, that tells me that these people do not know what a dictatorship means.\n\nLet me be very clear here. If the United States becomes a dictatorship there will eventually be firing squads and other massive violence against \"enemies\" of the state. I know that I'm probably going to be one of the people in front of those firing squads because Trump has said he hates me more than any other journalist. Killing people is what dictators do. Dictator Trump and his successors would be no different. Donald Trump shared a video on his Truth Social site which stated that he was going to establish a \"unified Reich.\" He's since taken that video down and is blaming it on a junior staffer. Trump always wants plausible deniability. But people shouldn't mistake what's going on here. I've been telling people for at least nine years that Trump intends to become America's first dictator. He doesn't know what's in the Constitution. He claims to have the power to do anything -- including murdering people -- as president.\n\nHow are you assessing the mainstream news media's coverage of the hush-money trial?\n\nI think there's been a great deal of variation in the quality of the coverage and commentary. It's mostly dependent on the quality of a given journalist's knowledge of the law. Most journalists are generalists; they don't know everything. When you see lawyers like Lisa Rubin and Andrew Weissmann, who are being paid by MSNBC, talk about what happened in the courtroom, you're getting a serious discussion. Yes, it may sometimes get more into the weeds than I think is necessary but, you are going to have a very serious discussion. Much of the general interest coverage is by reporters who do not understand the basics of how trials work. In my opinion, the cable stations have done pretty well. By comparison, the three network newscasts have depended entirely on the quality of the journalist covering the hush-money trial.\n\nYou have repeatedly said that Donald Trump is basically done for and will be convicted in this first criminal trial. I have had other experts, both on and off the record, counsel that the American people -- and those of us publicly discussing and writing about Trump and these trials and the democracy crisis -- should be much more cautious given the technical nature of the charges and how mercurial juries can be. Your intervention?\n\nThe elements of the hush-money case have all been established at trial. The prosecution has established the falsification of the records, the payment of the checks. They've introduced into evidence, tape recordings showing that Donald Trump knew exactly what was going on. Furthermore, Trump's mindset was not that he was protecting his wife Melania. Trump literally disavowed that as a defense by saying he didn't care, and he tried to delay paying Stormy Daniels roughly a week before the election. Trump's reasoning was that \"I won't have to pay her because either I'll be president and I can take care of it or I won't be president and it won't matter.\"\n\nAlso, this jury is unusual in a very important way. It is a highly educated jury that includes two lawyers. Of note, there are six alternates. Normally a criminal trial has two alternates. This tells us that Judge Juan Merchan was concerned that there'd be a ringer, a Trump MAGA supporter. If there is a single juror holding out who won't pay attention to the facts, the judge can replace that juror and order the new jury to start deliberations over. On the evidence, the best Donald Trump can hope for is a hung jury. But the judge has already taken care of this by having six alternates.\n\nWhat is your assessment of Michael Cohen's \"performance\" during the trial?\n\nI actually thought Michael Cohen did very well on the witness stand. He got some sharp points in on cross-examination because Trump's lawyers instead of sitting down asked all gratuitous additional questions at Trump's insistence. It is common for law enforcement to use criminals to go after other criminals, including people who are hitmen and major drug dealers. My experience as a journalist has been that some of the best sources I've had were people whose reputations were that they lie all the time. Michael Cohen was paid by Donald Trump to lie. But once it became in their interest to tell the truth, these types of crooks have been among the best sources of my entire career, because they had an interest in being truthful with me. Of course, Michael Cohen has nothing but bad things to say about Donald Trump given how the Justice Department under Trump's administration went after him. Cohen is biased against Trump - and with good reason. But that does not matter. In the end, it is the truth of the matter, not Michael Cohen's attitude. That is what matters to the jury.\n\nWhat do the reactions of the jury tell us about the hush-money case?\n\nI haven't been in the jury room or the overflow room. So, my reporting here is second-hand. The reporters and journalists who are physically there have said that the jury has been quite attentive and that they've paid close attention to some of the key elements of proving the case. The prosecutors, for example, went through the details of each check. The jurors were paying close attention to those details. Trump has repeatedly fallen asleep in the courtroom, rolled his eyes and made other facial expressions in disgust. That doesn't go over well with jurors. They feel disrespected as jurors.\n\nIs this strategic? Trump just being his regular horrible self? Something else?\n\nTrump is clearly showing his contempt for the jury. Juries pay attention to how you react, if you're sitting at the defense table. If someone says something important about a case they look to you, the defendant, to see how you react. Are you stone faced? Are you smiling? Are you cowering? Donald hurts himself here. It is important to understand that Donald Trump has no empathy for anyone. That includes his children. We are objects to Donald Trump, not people. That includes the people closest to him. This is a man who has lived a miserable life. Trump's bad behavior in court cost him real money in the second E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Likewise, Trump's bad behavior is going to cost him big in the hush-money trial too. The big question is, how long will the jury be out? Because there are two lawyers on this jury, they're not going to go out and come back in 20 minutes. But I'd be surprised if the jury is out more than one full day, or two at the most. If it goes on beyond that I would be surprised and that suggests something else is going on.\n\nI am a lifelong comic book and graphic novel reader. What is in the thought bubble over Trump's head? You know him. What's going on in his mind?\n\nHow can these insignificant nothings pass judgment on me, the greatest person who's ever lived, the world's leading expert on everything? How dare they!\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nDoes Donald Trump really believe such things?\n\nDonald Trump knows that he is a fraud. He has persuaded himself to believe in the narrative about himself that he has created, however untrue it is. The problem with Donald Trump's personal narrative is that it is a reaction to the monster his father was, to the desperate emptiness inside that he tries to fill with claims that he has all this wealth that he doesn't actually have. Bullying other people is a big part of Trump that makes sense of his life too. Trump has threatened me many times. When Donald Trump is alone at night with his thoughts, he is deeply terrified. The hush-money trial is just the start. Trump knows that at the end of the road, he is going to end up in prison.\n\nWhat do you think will happen with the resolution of the hush-money case?\n\nJudge Merchan, having been so careful all the way through, will follow the normal procedure. He will not have Trump immediately taken into custody. He will order a probation report, which is the standard thing you do before sentencing. Judge Merchan will then set a date for sentencing. Because of the ten criminal contempt charges, Trump may get a harsher sentence than he would have gotten otherwise if he hadn't been so recalcitrant.\n\nWhat do you think will happen when Donald Trump's fantasies meet the reality of a verdict in the hush-money trial? To reiterate, do you truly believe that Donald Trump ends up in prison? A former president?\n\nAbsolutely. But not necessarily for the hush-money case.\n\nThe criminal case where Trump will get a prison sentence is the Jan. 6 case. The precedent with the other convictions in the Jan. 6 case and the attack on the Capitol shows that Trump is going to get a prison sentence. As for the classified documents case, that is more uncertain. Who knows what's going to happen with Judge Aileen Cannon, who is clearly biased in favor of Trump. She may get removed at some point. If Trump is convicted and Cannon is not the judge, he will absolutely get a prison term in the classified documents case. There are people saying that the logistics of putting Donald Trump in prison are too difficult. That is not true. There are many ways to put Trump in prison. You can put him in a wing of a prison and close the rest of it. You can put Trump in a military stockade. There are many ways to do this. The Secret Service will be with Trump, and he will be in isolated confinement. In the end, Donald Trump will go to prison and there is a reasonable chance he will either die in prison or be released on a compassionate release basis as his life is coming to an end.\n\nThere is a great deal of concern from experts in domestic terrorism, civil wars, insurgencies, and other forms of political violence that if Donald Trump is found guilty there may be significant violence by his MAGA followers and other right-wing forces.

So it was only fitting that, on the day prosecution and defense gave their closing statements before the jury begins its deliberations, it should turn into a full-scale Big Top.\n\nRobert De Niro appeared as the Star Clown, haranguing Americans outside the Manhattan court for even daring to think about voting for Trump and claiming, in a rant that got ever more bizarre, that The Donald was going to 'destroy the world'.\n\nPerhaps this is what passes for sophisticated political analysis in Hollywood. Or maybe it was just an embarrassing attempt at clown comedy.\n\nLike all actors, De Niro had been given a script from which to read. But -- only in New York -- he had to contend with a car alarm and numerous hecklers, a combination which caused him to stumble over his words and lose his place.\n\nIt will have dawned on him that he's treated with rather more respect on the movie set -- and that perhaps this politics stuff is harder than it looks.\n\nRobert De Niro appeared as the Star Clown, haranguing Americans outside the Manhattan court for even daring to think about voting for Trump and claiming, in a rant that got ever more bizarre, that The Donald was going to'destroy the world'.\n\nInside the court the closing arguments were treated with respect and silence. We didn't learn anything new but we were reminded of how much of a circus it's all been.\n\nThe prosecution has depended on probably the most untrustworthy witness, Michael Cohen, in American legal history.\n\nThe defense has denied events, like Trump's one-night fling with Stormy Daniels, which were not germane to the defendant's innocence or guilt but which undermined the defense's credibility.\n\nThroughout it all, it remained something of a mystery exactly what crime Trump had committed, even for those who were following proceedings closely. This was a circus without a cause. But it has had plenty of pyrotechnics.\n\nThe trial will be forever remembered for the testimonies of Daniels and Cohen.\n\nDaniels provided plenty prurient details of her hotel room encounter with Trump, which the media naturally lapped up but which were irrelevant to the charges against the former president.\n\nHer testimony should not have been allowed but, because Trump was denying anything nefarious ever happened, she was allowed to get away with it. Trump's lawyers suffered for that.\n\nEven so, the titillating testimony not withstanding, Daniels knew nothing about the crux of the case: the alleged reimbursement of Cohen after he paid her the hush money, and the falsifying of business documents to cover up these repayments to him.\n\nThis is why Cohen was the more important prosecution witness -- because he knows about all these things -- which was bad news for the prosecution.\n\nIn this particular circus, the porn star was more credible than the lawyer. Only in a Trump trial!\n\nCohen, once Trump's trusted attorney, took to the witness stand having already done jail time for illegal campaign contributions, tax fraud and other felonies. He also brought with him a reputation for being a serial liar and perjurer -- not exactly the ideal witness around which to build a case against Trump.\n\nCohen proceeded to confirm everything bad already thought about him.\n\nThe prosecution has depended on probably the most untrustworthy witness, Michael Cohen (pictured), in American legal history.\n\nThe defense has denied events, like Trump's one-night fling with Stormy Daniels, which were not germane to the defendant's innocence or guilt but which undermined the defense's credibility.\n\nDaniels (pictured) provided plenty prurient details of her hotel room encounter with Trump, which the media naturally lapped up but which were irrelevant to the charges against the former president.\n\nPerhaps the most emblematic moment came when he freely admitted stealing from Trump. Cohen had invoiced his boss's organization for $50,000 for a tech company. Cohen passed on $20,000 and pocketed the remaining $30,000.\n\nAgain, only in a Trump trial would the prosecution's star witness shamelessly admit to being a thief. You could almost hear the prosecution jaws hit the floor.\n\nUnderstandably, the defense devoted most of its closing remarks to underline just what a shyster Cohen is.\n\nThat was the main reason federal prosecutors decided years ago not to proceed with this case. They didn't want to go into battle with Cohen as their main witness.\n\nBut Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was elected on a 'get Trump' platform and doesn't really care who he has to rely on to convict him.\n\nAmid the welter of words and commentary let's try to cut through to some simple truths:\n\nI'm in little doubt Trump had his one-night stand with Stormy and that, when she threatened to go public on the eve of the 2016 election, he sanctioned Cohen to pay her off, then muddied the trail of repayments. I don't believe Trump's denials to the contrary and the evidence against him is strong.\n\nBut while much of this case is unsavory, none of it amounts to criminality.\n\nIt may be wrong but it is not illegal to have an extra-marital assignation and Trump would not be the first presidential candidate or president to have had one -- not by a long chalk.\n\nIt is not illegal to pay hush-money, even if it is underhand.\n\nIt is not illegal to insist on a non-disclosure agreement in such circumstances. America is awash in NDAs.\n\nIt is illegal to falsify business documents but that is a misdemeanor under New York law, which usually results in a slap on the wrist and not jail time.\n\nYou can regard all this as conduct unbecoming for someone who wishes to sit in the Oval Office. You might even regard it as reason enough not to vote for him. But it does not amount to criminality.\n\nAnd so, Bragg has had to argue that Trump falsified his business records with the intent to commit or conceal a crime. That's what would turn a misdemeanor into a felony (and potential jail time). But what exactly was the crime?\n\nEven as the trial comes to an end, that is something the prosecution has failed to establish.\n\nBragg has suggested three possible underlying crimes: a violation of state election law; a violation of federal election law; and tax fraud/evasion.\n\nThe tax crime possibility seems especially weak. Cohen was reimbursed with far more than the $130,000 he was out for hushing Daniels because he would face income tax on the reimbursement. So he was repaid by enough to cover his tax bills too -- grossed up in the jargon.\n\nIf anything, the taxman was a net gainer from the cover up.\n\nNor has a violation of election laws been established. Yes, it's reasonable to assume Trump wanted to bury the story to facilitate his election. Politicians try to bury bad news all the time.\n\nThe money didn't come from campaign contributions. It came from Trump's own resources. Yes, buying off the porn star might have helped Trump get elected. So might the state of the economy and Hilary Clinton's lackluster campaign.\n\nI'm in little doubt Trump had his one-night stand with Stormy and that, when she threatened to go public on the eve of the 2016 election, he sanctioned Cohen to pay her off. But while much of this case is unsavory, none of it amounts to criminality.\n\nAnd so, DA Bragg has had to argue that Trump falsified his business records with the intent to commit or conceal a crime. But what exactly was the crime? As the trial comes to an end, that is something the prosecution has failed to establish. (Pictured: Sketch of Daniels on the stand).\n\nIt's a weak basis for claiming criminality, the prosecution has not proved an underlying criminal intent and I can see why the feds passed on it.\n\nThe jury will begin its deliberations after Judge Juan Merchan gives it his final instructions.\n\nHis words will be closely scrutinized. He is widely seen to have fallen over backwards to accommodate the prosecution and, if his instructions are in the same vein, the grounds for an appeal - should Trump be convicted - will be all the stronger.\n\nIf we are struggling to identify the criminality so will some in the jury. But Trump's biggest danger is not that he's found guilty on the facts but simply because the whole episode is seedy, sleazy and unedifying.\n\nPorn stars. Dodgy lawyers. Hush money. Trashy tabloids. Fiddled company accounts. The mood music surrounding the whole farrago is Trump's biggest danger.\n\nTrump, of course, could be acquitted. But that is unlikely with a New York jury.\n\nHe could be found guilty on all or most of the 34 counts against him (the number is misleading since it merely reflects the repayment of Cohen in instalments), which is possible. But any jail time is likely to be stayed pending appeal, which could take forever. Trump will be free to campaign through to November and beyond.\n\nOr there could be a hung jury: it only takes one holdout for the judge to be forced to declare a mistrial.\n\nBragg will then have to decide if he really wants to go through the whole rigmarole again, by which time Trump could be in the White House.\n\nSo, whatever the outcome, the attempt to use the law to derail Trump's attempt to be re-elected looks like failing. There is no prospect of any of the other legal cases against him making court before November.\n\nThe New York case was the Democrats one shot and it was always their weakest -- a circus which should never have been allowed to come to town.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/28/21/85439319-0-image-m-12_1716926956054.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

What are the odds we get one juror who will do what's right? Cohen can't be trusted!\n\nBlanche detailed many of the lies that Cohen tried to sell to the jurors:\n\nBlanche is going through times Blanche says Cohen has lied to this jury. One example is the number of times he says he talked to Robert Costello. Cohen said it was about 10. But then then later, phone records were introduced that showed it was dozens and dozens of calls. Now, he's reminding jury about Cohen's call to Trump's body guard, Keith Schiller.\n\nDuring the trial, Blanche's cross examination of Cohen about THE call to Schiller and whether it was about finalizing payment to Stormy Daniels for NDA. Blanche used texts to suggest it was about harassing phone calls from a 14-year-old. During that cross, Blanche's voice grew louder, he was spoke more quickly.\n\nNow, again, he's speaking in similar fashion. Faster, louder. To punctuate the issue. Blanche also is acknowledging why the inconsistency about the call matters. \"That is perjury,\" says Blanche. \"Is that the biggest lie in the world? Maybe not.\"\n\nBlanche says. This goes to the heart of whether the alleged lie on the call matters. Blanche says it shows Cohen does not take the oath of the truth seriously.\n\nBlanche points out: He lied to his family. He lied to his wife. He lied to his banker.\n\nThings grew heated, however, when Blanche told the jury that they shouldn't send Trump to prison based on the testimony of a liar. Judge Juan Merchan -- who's shown himself repeatedly to be biased against the former president -- went nuclear over the apparent violation.\n\n\"That was outrageous, Mr. Blanche. Someone who's been a prosecutor for as long as you have, someone who's been an attorney as long as you have knows that is highly inappropriate,\" Merchan told Blanche Tuesday, after the defense team wrapped up closing arguments, according to reports.\n\nJurors in criminal cases are typically instructed not to consider potential punishment for defendants when weighing a case.\n\nFollowing Blanche's comments, Merchan granted the prosecution team's request for \"curative instruction,\" which will \"cure\" Blanche's statement to the jury.\n\nThe prosecution will get their turn Tuesday afternoon and indicated they needed four to four and a half hours for their closing arguments.\n\nMore Manhattan madness:\n\nHOT TAKES: Let the Mockery Begin of Insane Biden Effort at Trump Trial -- and How It May Help Trump", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_hoge@redstate.com", "name": "Bob Hoge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Telephony", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/136/2514c285-c055-48cb-a010-591e3810ba86.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms\n\n-- Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump's trial\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Republicans routinely attack the prosecutor and judge as \"corrupt\" but have largely refrained from attempting to discredit the jury itself.\n\nThat could change as soon as this week, when jurors will decide whether Trump is guilty of falsifying business records in connection with a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, but for now, Republicans are holding out hope Trump will be spared a sentence.\n\n\"It's New York City. That's all I can say. It's Manhattan,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said of the jury pool. \"I don't have high expectations, but I do think there's got to be enough of them that have a conscience and some integrity.\"\n\nThe note of optimism is due, in part, to the perceived lack of credibility of Michael Cohen, the former Trump \"fixer\" and witness who arranged the hush money payment. His admission that he previously stole from Trump, plus his prior conviction for lying to Congress, will be reiterated by the defense in closing arguments that begin on Tuesday.\n\nIt also has to do with the possibility that jurors will be divided over whether the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. District Attorney Alvin Bragg has not only accused Trump of falsifying business records, a misdemeanor. He has also pursued a felony conviction by arguing that Trump, who denies the charges and the affair with Daniels, committed the crime ahead of the 2016 election as part of a larger criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe prosecution emphasizes that the charges against Trump do not hinge on the testimony of Cohen alone. That side has brought before the jury 20 witnesses and supporting documents to make its case.\n\nHowever, if even one juror dissents, known as a hung jury, the judge will declare a mistrial.\n\n\"I would be willing to state with metaphysical certainty that Donald J. Trump is not going to be convicted in that trial,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said. \"I can see an acquittal. I can see a hung jury. But I can't see a conviction under any circumstance.\"\n\nNot all congressional Republicans were so adamant in interviews with the Washington Examiner. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said it was \"entirely possible we see a conviction.\"\n\nMost left the door open to a guilty verdict while expressing they were breathing easier after four weeks of testimony.\n\n\"I actually feel cautiously optimistic,\" said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), who visited the Manhattan courtroom two weeks ago.\n\nTrump's lawyers attempted to exclude anyone from the jury who might rule unfavorably. However, the 12 jurors who were eventually chosen represent the biggest wild card of the entire case.\n\nThe panel, made up of five women and seven men, were whittled from a pool of 200 possible jurors across three days of jury selection. Their names were kept private at the discretion of the judge, but the details that were provided to the public show a jury with a wide set of backgrounds.\n\nEach said they could be fair and impartial in the case against Trump.\n\nTRUMP TRIAL: HERE ARE THE 12 JURORS SEATED FOR HUSH MONEY CASE\n\nA guilty verdict would feed into Republicans' claims that Trump was tried in a \"kangaroo court.\" Cruz speculated that the Manhattan jury deciding the case \"may well be quite partisan\" in expressing his pessimism, while the former president appeared to violate his gag order at the outset of the trial by spreading the unfounded claim that liberals were lying to infiltrate the jury.\n\nYet a guilty verdict could also give Democrats a fresh rebuttal to that line of attack if a jury of Trump's peers convict him.\n\n\"Clearly, it's not a weaponized system of justice. Despite everything Trump says, it will make it even more difficult for him to make that argument,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said of a conviction.\n\nThe prosecution, one of four against Trump, has injected a degree of uncertainty and intrigue into the high-stakes rematch with President Joe Biden. However, lawmakers from both parties doubted it would sway the minds of voters much if Trump is convicted.\n\nThe former president is expected to appeal the conviction if he is found guilty, while any possible sentencing is not likely to include jail time.\n\n\"I think if he's acquitted, it affirmatively helps him in a big way, but I don't think a conviction has any effect,\" Vance said of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"No,\" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) said unequivocally when asked if a conviction would hurt Trump. \"In fact, I'm sure they'll fundraise off of that.\"\n\n\"He's begging to be put in jail and be made a martyr and everything,\" Fetterman added. \"It's not going to have an impact. It's going to be the same stark choice that it's always been.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_sivak@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "David Sivak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cramer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Tillis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thom Tillis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Because Joe Biden's numbers are in the tank,\" Trump adviser Jason Miller said, referring to polls that show Trump beating Biden, and adding \"the best they can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nBiden has taken a few jabs at Trump since his hush money trial began in April.

Donald J. Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments in Manhattan today, the jury will start its deliberations Wednesday on the 34 criminal counts against the former president. More than a year after his indictment and arraignment and following a six-week trial, Trump will probably have to wait only a couple of more days before he hears from the jury.\n\nFriday afternoons get more than their fair share of verdicts, as jurors tend to find consensus more readily when they're missing out on weekends, not time on their jobs.\n\nHe could get a hung jury, sure. But getting to a mistrial takes a lot longer. In my years covering the courts, especially in high profile cases, judges do not yield lightly to a foreperson's claims of impasse. As hard and as long as the lawyers in this case have worked to empanel a jury for the most famous man in the world and present the complicated evidence, Judge Juan Merchan would surely make the members of the panel stew for some time before he released them.\n\nMore: What happens if Trump is found guilty in hush money case? Prison is certainly an option.\n\nThat's how you get to a partial conviction. The holdouts agree to vote \"guilty\" on some of the charges in exchange for \"not guilty\" votes on the rest. Each of the 34 counts relates to a specific document prosecutors say was falsified by Trump or at his behest. They could, for instance, reject the charges based on actions by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen but still convict on Trump ledger entries or checks.\n\nI have been uniformly impressed by the seriousness with which jury members take their jobs in every case I covered, but also noted their willingness to get to a deal. And here, while the political implications are significant, the penalties are light. Even a conviction on the full boat of charges would probably mean only a couple of months in prison, and quite possibly just probation, for an elderly defendant with no prior criminal record. The stakes feel high based on press coverage, but as a matter of crime and punishment, no one's life is on the line. A good foreperson might understand, ahem, the art of the deal.\n\nI don't know how the betting odds on a Trump conviction have been running, but it would hardly be a long shot for him to be found guilty. This is Manhattan, in a county where Trump got 12 percent of the vote four years ago. He's behaved boorishly throughout the proceedings and attacked a process that by now, jurors probably feel pretty proud to be a part of, even if they're ready to go home.\n\nBut the question the world has really been asking isn't about the disposition of the case, but the disposition of the electorate about it. The most recent Marquette University Law School poll in key battleground Wisconsin suggests a logical conclusion by voters: Without a conviction, Trump led President Joe Biden by a robust 6 points. With a conviction, Biden led by 4 points.\n\nMore: A guilty verdict? Donald Trump and allies are bracing voters for the worst\n\nThe way Marquette did the poll was to break the respondents into two groups: half were asked about their vote if Trump was found guilty, the other half if he was found not guilty. In both groups, the share of respondents saying they would vote third party or not vote was the same at 18 percent. With a conviction, Trump went from 44 percent to 39 percent, while Biden went from 38 percent if Trump were found not guilty to 43 percent if Trump is found guilty.\n\nThat 10-point swing tells us that there is a significant chunk of the electorate that would actually switch its vote based on a conviction, or at least they think right now that it would.\n\nBut let's imagine on a mild and sunny afternoon this Friday, Trump gets popped. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Then what? It's not like he's going to be led through the sally port in handcuffs and taken to Rikers Island. In any case, sentencing would take months, and in this case there would surely be a mountain of appeals. If he is convicted, it might be years before Trump is sentenced, even if he doesn't win in November.\n\nSo Trump would be a felon ... probably maybe. Having evidently delayed the trials on the other, more serious charges against him until after the election, this seedy case will stand alone in the court of public opinion. Even many of Trump's harshest critics have acknowledged that it was quite a bit of bootstrapping by an ambitious district attorney, so the Republicans would have a pretty easy time spinning the verdict.\n\n\"We've seen this judge reversed before, and we are going to see it again here,\" they will tell us. And as the news media dives into the particulars of New York appellate law and the nature of pre-sentencing bonds, it will start to feel like a fizzle.\n\nThat's probably exactly what Republicans should be hoping for: a conviction followed by a question mark.\n\nOne of the ways that the trial has most benefited Trump is that it has kept him busy and scared. Whatever Trump says about the judge and his gag order, this trial has consumed the former president's attention. If he's going to act crazy, better for Republicans that he act crazy about his personal problems rather than politics and policy.\n\nImagine how much more his administration could have done if Trump had been consumed in court cases rather than blundering into policy questions via pre-dawn tweets and impromptu press conferences.\n\nWith months to turn the case into a muddle to the public and Trump walking around free on appeal, a conviction wouldn't be so bad for his chances. It's not that it would help, it's just a harm that could be mitigated and come with some ancillary benefits in the way of offering some check on Trump's bad behavior.\n\nWhat Republicans should worry much more about is a Trump acquittal. Beyond the reach of the judge and jury and primed for revenge, an emboldened Trump would be hell on wheels. Ahead in the polls and having beaten the rap, Trump would come careening into the general election, as always, his own worst enemy.\n\nWhen then-FBI Director James Comey dropped the Anthony Weiner laptop story into the campaign narrative 11 days before the election, Trump had already been running scared for three weeks. His relative discipline had left the space clear for a story that, until it was debunked, seemed to reaffirm all the worst suspicions persuadable voters had about the sneaky, sleazy Clintons.\n\nAmericans have forgotten a lot of the exhaustion they felt about Trump and his antics, his cruelty, and his chaos. A post-acquittal Trump who is ready to settle scores and take no heed of warnings to behave himself would remind voters only too well why they got rid of him in the first place.\n\nIt's never good to have a nominee who Americans think is a crook and a lout, but it's even worse to have one who doesn't know that they see him that way.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trump did not testify in his own defense.\n\nAs leading historian Heather Cox Richardson notes in her newsletter: \"Trump's refusal to take the stand encapsulates the MAGA approach to politics. Since the 2020 presidential election, he and his surrogates have made repeated accusations and statements about how the system is rigged against them and alleged there is evidence that proves them right. Crucially, they make those arguments only in front of television cameras or on podcasts and radio. They refuse to make them under oath in a court of law, where there are penalties for lying.\"\n\nDonald Trump's three other criminal trials have encountered significant delays. This means that the only chance to hold Trump somewhat responsible for his decades-long crime spree is a lurid hush-money trial. Public opinion polls and other research show that a guilty conviction in the hush-money trial (or the other three criminal trials) may sway enough Americans to either vote against or otherwise not support Trump in the 2024 election. Many legal experts have concluded that it is much more likely than not, given the extreme preponderance of the evidence and lacking quality of his defense, that Donald Trump will be found guilty in this first, and perhaps only, criminal trial.\n\nThat the future of America's multiracial democracy could ultimately be decided by a jury's decision in a hush-money trial, is a condemnation of America's political culture and larger society. Such a reality should cause all reasonable Americans a great amount of anxiety and concern about the future of their country and its democracy.\n\nUltimately, Donald Trump's criminal trial and possible conviction should not be celebrated. That the country elected such a man who was and is demonstrably unfit for the presidency (and who is trying to take back the White House and is now tied with President Biden in the early 2024 election polls) should be a source of national shame and embarrassment.\n\nIn an attempt to make better sense of Donald Trump's hush-money trial, what happens next with the jury and sentencing, if the much-discussed \"walls\" have finally closed in on Trump and how the corrupt ex-president is processing this reality, and the possibilities of violence by political cultists, I recently spoke with David Cay Johnston. He is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and bestselling author who teaches at Syracuse University College of Law, although he is not a lawyer. He has written three books about Donald Trump, who Johnston has covered for 36 years.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\nGiven your decades of experience with Donald Trump, how are you feeling given the imminent verdict in the hush-money trial, and the historic nature of these events more broadly? How are you making sense of this?\n\nDonald Trump hurt his own cause during his hush-money trial. Trump did much the same thing during the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial. Instead of accepting the advice of his counsel -- and there's a reason we refer to lawyers as \"counsel\" -- he told them what to do. You could see this in the cross-examinations of both Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. Instead of asking the questions that would hurt their claims and credibility in front of the jury and do some real damage, and then sitting down, Trump's attorneys went on and on and on. In the process, they created opportunities that were taken advantage of by both Daniels and Cohen to damage Donald Trump. Trump clearly ordered his attorneys to take that approach.\n\nIn my opinion, Donald Trump's conviction is as close to a certainty as you will ever get in a trial. I'm not surprised that he did not take the stand. Trump would never do that. His lawyers would have told him that it was suicide. And had Trump taken the stand and testified he would have absolutely talked himself straight into a conviction. His whole life is built on lies, and he can't keep those lies straight.\n\nWhat about your emotions?\n\nFor me, this is all professional. All I want to do is hold Trump responsible for what he has done. I don't really care about him personally. That's always been my attitude. I cover Donald Trump because 36 years ago, I realized that this guy is going to be a big force in American culture. I started building files on him and carefully covering him for long periods of time. My approach to Donald Trump is to expose and counter his myths with old school, solid, shoe-leather reporting.\n\nWhere are we with the narrative that the much-discussed \"walls\" are finally closing in on Donald Trump?\n\nIf Donald Trump is in fact convicted in the Manhattan criminal case as I expect will happen, we are going to see support for him drop in the polls. Much Trump polling support is soft. There are a lot of Americans who cannot stomach the notion of a convicted felon being president. But at this same time, it's become very clear -- to the point that even Utah Senator Mitt Romney is saying this -- that a large segment of the Republican Party doesn't believe in democracy, and they're perfectly happy to live under a dictatorship. Now, that tells me that these people do not know what a dictatorship means.\n\nLet me be very clear here. If the United States becomes a dictatorship there will eventually be firing squads and other massive violence against \"enemies\" of the state. I know that I'm probably going to be one of the people in front of those firing squads because Trump has said he hates me more than any other journalist. Killing people is what dictators do. Dictator Trump and his successors would be no different. Donald Trump shared a video on his Truth Social site which stated that he was going to establish a \"unified Reich.\" He's since taken that video down and is blaming it on a junior staffer. Trump always wants plausible deniability. But people shouldn't mistake what's going on here. I've been telling people for at least nine years that Trump intends to become America's first dictator. He doesn't know what's in the Constitution. He claims to have the power to do anything -- including murdering people -- as president.\n\nHow are you assessing the mainstream news media's coverage of the hush-money trial?\n\nI think there's been a great deal of variation in the quality of the coverage and commentary. It's mostly dependent on the quality of a given journalist's knowledge of the law. Most journalists are generalists; they don't know everything. When you see lawyers like Lisa Rubin and Andrew Weissmann, who are being paid by MSNBC, talk about what happened in the courtroom, you're getting a serious discussion. Yes, it may sometimes get more into the weeds than I think is necessary but, you are going to have a very serious discussion. Much of the general interest coverage is by reporters who do not understand the basics of how trials work. In my opinion, the cable stations have done pretty well. By comparison, the three network newscasts have depended entirely on the quality of the journalist covering the hush-money trial.\n\nYou have repeatedly said that Donald Trump is basically done for and will be convicted in this first criminal trial. I have had other experts, both on and off the record, counsel that the American people -- and those of us publicly discussing and writing about Trump and these trials and the democracy crisis -- should be much more cautious given the technical nature of the charges and how mercurial juries can be. Your intervention?\n\nThe elements of the hush-money case have all been established at trial. The prosecution has established the falsification of the records, the payment of the checks. They've introduced into evidence, tape recordings showing that Donald Trump knew exactly what was going on. Furthermore, Trump's mindset was not that he was protecting his wife Melania. Trump literally disavowed that as a defense by saying he didn't care, and he tried to delay paying Stormy Daniels roughly a week before the election. Trump's reasoning was that \"I won't have to pay her because either I'll be president and I can take care of it or I won't be president and it won't matter.\"\n\nAlso, this jury is unusual in a very important way. It is a highly educated jury that includes two lawyers. Of note, there are six alternates. Normally a criminal trial has two alternates. This tells us that Judge Juan Merchan was concerned that there'd be a ringer, a Trump MAGA supporter. If there is a single juror holding out who won't pay attention to the facts, the judge can replace that juror and order the new jury to start deliberations over. On the evidence, the best Donald Trump can hope for is a hung jury. But the judge has already taken care of this by having six alternates.\n\nWhat is your assessment of Michael Cohen's \"performance\" during the trial?\n\nI actually thought Michael Cohen did very well on the witness stand. He got some sharp points in on cross-examination because Trump's lawyers instead of sitting down asked all gratuitous additional questions at Trump's insistence. It is common for law enforcement to use criminals to go after other criminals, including people who are hitmen and major drug dealers. My experience as a journalist has been that some of the best sources I've had were people whose reputations were that they lie all the time. Michael Cohen was paid by Donald Trump to lie. But once it became in their interest to tell the truth, these types of crooks have been among the best sources of my entire career, because they had an interest in being truthful with me. Of course, Michael Cohen has nothing but bad things to say about Donald Trump given how the Justice Department under Trump's administration went after him. Cohen is biased against Trump - and with good reason. But that does not matter. In the end, it is the truth of the matter, not Michael Cohen's attitude. That is what matters to the jury.\n\nWhat do the reactions of the jury tell us about the hush-money case?\n\nI haven't been in the jury room or the overflow room. So, my reporting here is second-hand. The reporters and journalists who are physically there have said that the jury has been quite attentive and that they've paid close attention to some of the key elements of proving the case. The prosecutors, for example, went through the details of each check. The jurors were paying close attention to those details. Trump has repeatedly fallen asleep in the courtroom, rolled his eyes and made other facial expressions in disgust. That doesn't go over well with jurors. They feel disrespected as jurors.\n\nIs this strategic? Trump just being his regular horrible self? Something else?\n\nTrump is clearly showing his contempt for the jury. Juries pay attention to how you react, if you're sitting at the defense table. If someone says something important about a case they look to you, the defendant, to see how you react. Are you stone faced? Are you smiling? Are you cowering? Donald hurts himself here. It is important to understand that Donald Trump has no empathy for anyone. That includes his children. We are objects to Donald Trump, not people. That includes the people closest to him. This is a man who has lived a miserable life. Trump's bad behavior in court cost him real money in the second E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Likewise, Trump's bad behavior is going to cost him big in the hush-money trial too. The big question is, how long will the jury be out? Because there are two lawyers on this jury, they're not going to go out and come back in 20 minutes. But I'd be surprised if the jury is out more than one full day, or two at the most. If it goes on beyond that I would be surprised and that suggests something else is going on.\n\nI am a lifelong comic book and graphic novel reader. What is in the thought bubble over Trump's head? You know him. What's going on in his mind?\n\nHow can these insignificant nothings pass judgment on me, the greatest person who's ever lived, the world's leading expert on everything? How dare they!\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nDoes Donald Trump really believe such things?\n\nDonald Trump knows that he is a fraud. He has persuaded himself to believe in the narrative about himself that he has created, however untrue it is. The problem with Donald Trump's personal narrative is that it is a reaction to the monster his father was, to the desperate emptiness inside that he tries to fill with claims that he has all this wealth that he doesn't actually have. Bullying other people is a big part of Trump that makes sense of his life too. Trump has threatened me many times. When Donald Trump is alone at night with his thoughts, he is deeply terrified. The hush-money trial is just the start. Trump knows that at the end of the road, he is going to end up in prison.\n\nWhat do you think will happen with the resolution of the hush-money case?\n\nJudge Merchan, having been so careful all the way through, will follow the normal procedure. He will not have Trump immediately taken into custody. He will order a probation report, which is the standard thing you do before sentencing. Judge Merchan will then set a date for sentencing. Because of the ten criminal contempt charges, Trump may get a harsher sentence than he would have gotten otherwise if he hadn't been so recalcitrant.\n\nWhat do you think will happen when Donald Trump's fantasies meet the reality of a verdict in the hush-money trial? To reiterate, do you truly believe that Donald Trump ends up in prison? A former president?\n\nAbsolutely. But not necessarily for the hush-money case.\n\nThe criminal case where Trump will get a prison sentence is the Jan. 6 case. The precedent with the other convictions in the Jan. 6 case and the attack on the Capitol shows that Trump is going to get a prison sentence. As for the classified documents case, that is more uncertain. Who knows what's going to happen with Judge Aileen Cannon, who is clearly biased in favor of Trump. She may get removed at some point. If Trump is convicted and Cannon is not the judge, he will absolutely get a prison term in the classified documents case. There are people saying that the logistics of putting Donald Trump in prison are too difficult. That is not true. There are many ways to put Trump in prison. You can put him in a wing of a prison and close the rest of it. You can put Trump in a military stockade. There are many ways to do this. The Secret Service will be with Trump, and he will be in isolated confinement. In the end, Donald Trump will go to prison and there is a reasonable chance he will either die in prison or be released on a compassionate release basis as his life is coming to an end.\n\nThere is a great deal of concern from experts in domestic terrorism, civil wars, insurgencies, and other forms of political violence that if Donald Trump is found guilty there may be significant violence by his MAGA followers and other right-wing forces.

Blanche highlighted a long list of individuals Cohen has lied to: his family, his wife, his kids, his banker, prosecutors, a federal judge, Congress, the Federal Election Commission and \"every single reporter he talked to for about a year,\" according to Politico.

Donald J. Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments in Manhattan today, the jury will start its deliberations Wednesday on the 34 criminal counts against the former president. More than a year after his indictment and arraignment and following a six-week trial, Trump will probably have to wait only a couple of more days before he hears from the jury.\n\nFriday afternoons get more than their fair share of verdicts, as jurors tend to find consensus more readily when they're missing out on weekends, not time on their jobs.\n\nHe could get a hung jury, sure. But getting to a mistrial takes a lot longer. In my years covering the courts, especially in high profile cases, judges do not yield lightly to a foreperson's claims of impasse. As hard and as long as the lawyers in this case have worked to empanel a jury for the most famous man in the world and present the complicated evidence, Judge Juan Merchan would surely make the members of the panel stew for some time before he released them.\n\nMore: What happens if Trump is found guilty in hush money case? Prison is certainly an option.\n\nThat's how you get to a partial conviction. The holdouts agree to vote \"guilty\" on some of the charges in exchange for \"not guilty\" votes on the rest. Each of the 34 counts relates to a specific document prosecutors say was falsified by Trump or at his behest. They could, for instance, reject the charges based on actions by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen but still convict on Trump ledger entries or checks.\n\nI have been uniformly impressed by the seriousness with which jury members take their jobs in every case I covered, but also noted their willingness to get to a deal. And here, while the political implications are significant, the penalties are light. Even a conviction on the full boat of charges would probably mean only a couple of months in prison, and quite possibly just probation, for an elderly defendant with no prior criminal record. The stakes feel high based on press coverage, but as a matter of crime and punishment, no one's life is on the line. A good foreperson might understand, ahem, the art of the deal.\n\nI don't know how the betting odds on a Trump conviction have been running, but it would hardly be a long shot for him to be found guilty. This is Manhattan, in a county where Trump got 12 percent of the vote four years ago. He's behaved boorishly throughout the proceedings and attacked a process that by now, jurors probably feel pretty proud to be a part of, even if they're ready to go home.\n\nBut the question the world has really been asking isn't about the disposition of the case, but the disposition of the electorate about it. The most recent Marquette University Law School poll in key battleground Wisconsin suggests a logical conclusion by voters: Without a conviction, Trump led President Joe Biden by a robust 6 points. With a conviction, Biden led by 4 points.\n\nThe way Marquette did the poll was to break the respondents into two groups: half were asked about their vote if Trump was found guilty, the other half if he was found not guilty. In both groups, the share of respondents saying they would vote third party or not vote was the same at 18 percent. With a conviction, Trump went from 44 percent to 39 percent, while Biden went from 38 percent if Trump were found not guilty to 43 percent if Trump is found guilty.\n\nThat 10-point swing tells us that there is a significant chunk of the electorate that would actually switch its vote based on a conviction, or at least they think right now that it would.\n\nBut let's imagine on a mild and sunny afternoon this Friday, Trump gets popped. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Then what? It's not like he's going to be led through the sally port in handcuffs and taken to Rikers Island. In any case, sentencing would take months, and in this case there would surely be a mountain of appeals. If he is convicted, it might be years before Trump is sentenced, even if he doesn't win in November.\n\nSo Trump would be a felon ... probably maybe. Having evidently delayed the trials on the other, more serious charges against him until after the election, this seedy case will stand alone in the court of public opinion. Even many of Trump's harshest critics have acknowledged that it was quite a bit of bootstrapping by an ambitious district attorney, so the Republicans would have a pretty easy time spinning the verdict.\n\n\"We've seen this judge reversed before, and we are going to see it again here,\" they will tell us. And as the news media dives into the particulars of New York appellate law and the nature of pre-sentencing bonds, it will start to feel like a fizzle.\n\nThat's probably exactly what Republicans should be hoping for: a conviction followed by a question mark.\n\nOne of the ways that the trial has most benefited Trump is that it has kept him busy and scared. Whatever Trump says about the judge and his gag order, this trial has consumed the former president's attention. If he's going to act crazy, better for Republicans that he act crazy about his personal problems rather than politics and policy.\n\nImagine how much more his administration could have done if Trump had been consumed in court cases rather than blundering into policy questions via pre-dawn tweets and impromptu press conferences.\n\nWith months to turn the case into a muddle to the public and Trump walking around free on appeal, a conviction wouldn't be so bad for his chances. It's not that it would help, it's just a harm that could be mitigated and come with some ancillary benefits in the way of offering some check on Trump's bad behavior.\n\nWhat Republicans should worry much more about is a Trump acquittal. Beyond the reach of the judge and jury and primed for revenge, an emboldened Trump would be hell on wheels. Ahead in the polls and having beaten the rap, Trump would come careening into the general election, as always, his own worst enemy.\n\nTrump won the presidency in 2016 in substantial part because of the Access Hollywood scandal. The tape of Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitals and forcing them to kiss him came out exactly one month before the election. It sent his numbers through the floor, but it also made him afraid enough of a humiliating landslide defeat that he became willing to behave just a little better, to be just a little more disciplined in his messaging, to be just a little more normal.\n\nWhen then-FBI Director James Comey dropped the Anthony Weiner laptop story into the campaign narrative 11 days before the election, Trump had already been running scared for three weeks. His relative discipline had left the space clear for a story that, until it was debunked, seemed to reaffirm all the worst suspicions persuadable voters had about the sneaky, sleazy Clintons.\n\nAmericans have forgotten a lot of the exhaustion they felt about Trump and his antics, his cruelty, and his chaos. A post-acquittal Trump who is ready to settle scores and take no heed of warnings to behave himself would remind voters only too well why they got rid of him in the first place.\n\nIt's never good to have a nominee who Americans think is a crook and a lout, but it's even worse to have one who doesn't know that they see him that way.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Here's what every key witness said at Donald Trump's hush money trial\n\n-- As Trump's hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside\n\n-- Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations.\n\nJurors over the course of a month have heard testimony about sex and bookkeeping, tabloid journalism and presidential politics. Their task ahead will be to decide whether prosecutors who have charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION?\n\nWith closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them -- deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with.\n\nTo convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime. Any verdict must be unanimous.\n\nTo prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases.\n\nNew York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump's case and will not be considered by jurors.\n\nA SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME\n\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life.\n\nFor others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out -- including professional line sitters with pup tents -- for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal.\n\nThough most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump's entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public.\n\nThe former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK\n\nClosing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence.\n\nJurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Donald J. Trump.\n\nAfter closing arguments in Manhattan today, the jury will start its deliberations Wednesday on the 34 criminal counts against the former president. More than a year after his indictment and arraignment and following a six-week trial, Trump will probably have to wait only a couple of more days before he hears from the jury.\n\nFriday afternoons get more than their fair share of verdicts, as jurors tend to find consensus more readily when they're missing out on weekends, not time on their jobs.\n\nHe could get a hung jury, sure. But getting to a mistrial takes a lot longer. In my years covering the courts, especially in high profile cases, judges do not yield lightly to a foreperson's claims of impasse. As hard and as long as the lawyers in this case have worked to empanel a jury for the most famous man in the world and present the complicated evidence, Judge Juan Merchan would surely make the members of the panel stew for some time before he released them.\n\nMore: What happens if Trump is found guilty in hush money case? Prison is certainly an option.\n\nThat's how you get to a partial conviction. The holdouts agree to vote \"guilty\" on some of the charges in exchange for \"not guilty\" votes on the rest. Each of the 34 counts relates to a specific document prosecutors say was falsified by Trump or at his behest. They could, for instance, reject the charges based on actions by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen but still convict on Trump ledger entries or checks.\n\nI have been uniformly impressed by the seriousness with which jury members take their jobs in every case I covered, but also noted their willingness to get to a deal. And here, while the political implications are significant, the penalties are light. Even a conviction on the full boat of charges would probably mean only a couple of months in prison, and quite possibly just probation, for an elderly defendant with no prior criminal record. The stakes feel high based on press coverage, but as a matter of crime and punishment, no one's life is on the line. A good foreperson might understand, ahem, the art of the deal.\n\nI don't know how the betting odds on a Trump conviction have been running, but it would hardly be a long shot for him to be found guilty. This is Manhattan, in a county where Trump got 12 percent of the vote four years ago. He's behaved boorishly throughout the proceedings and attacked a process that by now, jurors probably feel pretty proud to be a part of, even if they're ready to go home.\n\nBut the question the world has really been asking isn't about the disposition of the case, but the disposition of the electorate about it. The most recent Marquette University Law School poll in key battleground Wisconsin suggests a logical conclusion by voters: Without a conviction, Trump led President Joe Biden by a robust 6 points. With a conviction, Biden led by 4 points.\n\nThe way Marquette did the poll was to break the respondents into two groups: half were asked about their vote if Trump was found guilty, the other half if he was found not guilty. In both groups, the share of respondents saying they would vote third party or not vote was the same at 18 percent. With a conviction, Trump went from 44 percent to 39 percent, while Biden went from 38 percent if Trump were found not guilty to 43 percent if Trump is found guilty.\n\nThat 10-point swing tells us that there is a significant chunk of the electorate that would actually switch its vote based on a conviction, or at least they think right now that it would.\n\nBut let's imagine on a mild and sunny afternoon this Friday, Trump gets popped. Guilty, guilty, guilty. Then what? It's not like he's going to be led through the sally port in handcuffs and taken to Rikers Island. In any case, sentencing would take months, and in this case there would surely be a mountain of appeals. If he is convicted, it might be years before Trump is sentenced, even if he doesn't win in November.\n\nSo Trump would be a felon ... probably maybe. Having evidently delayed the trials on the other, more serious charges against him until after the election, this seedy case will stand alone in the court of public opinion. Even many of Trump's harshest critics have acknowledged that it was quite a bit of bootstrapping by an ambitious district attorney, so the Republicans would have a pretty easy time spinning the verdict.\n\n\"We've seen this judge reversed before, and we are going to see it again here,\" they will tell us. And as the news media dives into the particulars of New York appellate law and the nature of pre-sentencing bonds, it will start to feel like a fizzle.\n\nThat's probably exactly what Republicans should be hoping for: a conviction followed by a question mark.\n\nOne of the ways that the trial has most benefited Trump is that it has kept him busy and scared. Whatever Trump says about the judge and his gag order, this trial has consumed the former president's attention. If he's going to act crazy, better for Republicans that he act crazy about his personal problems rather than politics and policy.\n\nImagine how much more his administration could have done if Trump had been consumed in court cases rather than blundering into policy questions via pre-dawn tweets and impromptu press conferences.\n\nWith months to turn the case into a muddle to the public and Trump walking around free on appeal, a conviction wouldn't be so bad for his chances. It's not that it would help, it's just a harm that could be mitigated and come with some ancillary benefits in the way of offering some check on Trump's bad behavior.\n\nWhat Republicans should worry much more about is a Trump acquittal. Beyond the reach of the judge and jury and primed for revenge, an emboldened Trump would be hell on wheels. Ahead in the polls and having beaten the rap, Trump would come careening into the general election, as always, his own worst enemy.\n\nWhen then-FBI Director James Comey dropped the Anthony Weiner laptop story into the campaign narrative 11 days before the election, Trump had already been running scared for three weeks. His relative discipline had left the space clear for a story that, until it was debunked, seemed to reaffirm all the worst suspicions persuadable voters had about the sneaky, sleazy Clintons.\n\nAmericans have forgotten a lot of the exhaustion they felt about Trump and his antics, his cruelty, and his chaos. A post-acquittal Trump who is ready to settle scores and take no heed of warnings to behave himself would remind voters only too well why they got rid of him in the first place.\n\nIt's never good to have a nominee who Americans think is a crook and a lout, but it's even worse to have one who doesn't know that they see him that way.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Republicans routinely attack the prosecutor and judge as \"corrupt\" but have largely refrained from attempting to discredit the jury itself.\n\nThat could change as soon as this week, when jurors will decide whether Trump is guilty of falsifying business records in connection with a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, but for now, Republicans are holding out hope Trump will be spared a sentence.\n\n\"It's New York City. That's all I can say. It's Manhattan,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said of the jury pool. \"I don't have high expectations, but I do think there's got to be enough of them that have a conscience and some integrity.\"\n\nThe note of optimism is due, in part, to the perceived lack of credibility of Michael Cohen, the former Trump \"fixer\" and witness who arranged the hush money payment. His admission that he previously stole from Trump, plus his prior conviction for lying to Congress, will be reiterated by the defense in closing arguments that begin on Tuesday.\n\nIt also has to do with the possibility that jurors will be divided over whether the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. District Attorney Alvin Bragg has not only accused Trump of falsifying business records, a misdemeanor. He has also pursued a felony conviction by arguing that Trump, who denies the charges and the affair with Daniels, committed the crime ahead of the 2016 election as part of a larger criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe prosecution emphasizes that the charges against Trump do not hinge on the testimony of Cohen alone. That side has brought before the jury 20 witnesses and supporting documents to make its case.\n\nHowever, if even one juror dissents, known as a hung jury, the judge will declare a mistrial.\n\n\"I would be willing to state with metaphysical certainty that Donald J. Trump is not going to be convicted in that trial,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said. \"I can see an acquittal. I can see a hung jury. But I can't see a conviction under any circumstance.\"\n\nNot all congressional Republicans were so adamant in interviews with the Washington Examiner. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said it was \"entirely possible we see a conviction.\"\n\nMost left the door open to a guilty verdict while expressing they were breathing easier after four weeks of testimony.\n\n\"I actually feel cautiously optimistic,\" said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), who visited the Manhattan courtroom two weeks ago.\n\nTrump's lawyers attempted to exclude anyone from the jury who might rule unfavorably. However, the 12 jurors who were eventually chosen represent the biggest wild card of the entire case.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe panel, made up of five women and seven men, were whittled from a pool of 200 possible jurors across three days of jury selection. Their names were kept private at the discretion of the judge, but the details that were provided to the public show a jury with a wide set of backgrounds.\n\nEach said they could be fair and impartial in the case against Trump.\n\nTRUMP TRIAL: HERE ARE THE 12 JURORS SEATED FOR HUSH MONEY CASE\n\nA guilty verdict would feed into Republicans' claims that Trump was tried in a \"kangaroo court.\" Cruz speculated that the Manhattan jury deciding the case \"may well be quite partisan\" in expressing his pessimism, while the former president appeared to violate his gag order at the outset of the trial by spreading the unfounded claim that liberals were lying to infiltrate the jury.\n\nYet a guilty verdict could also give Democrats a fresh rebuttal to that line of attack if a jury of Trump's peers convict him.\n\n\"Clearly, it's not a weaponized system of justice. Despite everything Trump says, it will make it even more difficult for him to make that argument,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said of a conviction.\n\nThe prosecution, one of four against Trump, has injected a degree of uncertainty and intrigue into the high-stakes rematch with President Joe Biden. However, lawmakers from both parties doubted it would sway the minds of voters much if Trump is convicted.\n\nThe former president is expected to appeal the conviction if he is found guilty, while any possible sentencing is not likely to include jail time.\n\n\"I think if he's acquitted, it affirmatively helps him in a big way, but I don't think a conviction has any effect,\" Vance said of Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"No,\" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) said unequivocally when asked if a conviction would hurt Trump. \"In fact, I'm sure they'll fundraise off of that.\"\n\n\"He's begging to be put in jail and be made a martyr and everything,\" Fetterman added. \"It's not going to have an impact. It's going to be the same stark choice that it's always been.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Under state and federal law, that kind of payment would need to be reported to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAgain, prosecutors need only to prove that Mr Trump intended to influence the election through those unlawful means, not that he committed them himself.\n\n\"'Unlawful means' doesn't mean criminal. It means violation of the law,\" according to Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo.\n\nAnother one of those \"unlawful means\": Mr Trump helped Cohen violate tax law by allegedly approving a payment plan that \"camouflaged\" reimbursements as income, \"double dipped\" for tax purposes, according to prosecutors.\n\nIt was even written down - a document shown in evidence and corroborated by Trump Organization accountant Jeffrey McConney shows handwritten notes from former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, doing the math to pay Cohen for reimbursing Ms Daniels, with additional bonuses and other payments, including more than $100,000 to account for the taxes owed on it, all spread out in $35,000 checks in 2017.\n\nMr Trump's attorneys have argued that conspiring to influence the election was not unlawful - candidates seek to influence elections all the time, they said.\n\nAnd they argued that there couldn't be any conspiracy in 2017: Mr Trump already won the election.\n\n\"They could not possibly have promoted President Trump's election because it already happened,\" defense attorney Emil Bove argued on May 21. \"The election was over. ...

Merchan, in response, granted the prosecutors' request and called Blanche's comment \"outrageous.\"\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Merchan told Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate.

Period.\"\n\nCourts have long held that juries are not to consider penalties of a crime when determining whether prosecutors have proven beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed.\n\nIn his curative instruction, Merchan explained this to the jury in Trump's case and called Blanche's comment about prison \"improper.\"\n\n\"You must disregard it,\" Merchan said.\n\nProsecutors also took issue with a comment Blanche made about a retainer agreement and asked Merchan to issue a second curative instruction on that, but Merchan denied that request.\n\nBlanche's comment about prison came as he was speaking about Michael Cohen, prosecutors' star witness in the case who provided the most direct evidence that Trump allegedly had knowledge of an illegal payment scheme to silence porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Cohen's evidence came in the form of testimony about his recollection of phone calls and meetings with Trump; however, Cohen's credibility has long been a glaring problem for prosecutors.\n\nCohen, Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax evasion, campaign finance violations, lying to a bank, and lying to Congress. He has since pursued a lucrative vendetta against Trump, raking in millions of dollars by selling books and speaking on podcast episodes about his disdain for his former boss.\n\nBlanche, as part of his closing arguments, tore into Cohen, telling jurors he is the \"the GLOAT, the greatest liar of all time.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nProsecutors began their closing arguments Tuesday afternoon.

Public polling has found voters see the Manhattan charges as the least serious of the dozens he is facing, and many Americans are not paying much attention to the case.\n\nA majority of Americans in a PBS-NPR-Marist poll published in May said they were not following the trial much or at all. An earlier CNN poll from the beginning days of the trial had similar findings, with 51% of people saying they were not following it closely. Those who are paying attention to the trial and charges are also expecting Trump to be convicted on at least some of the charges, with early two-thirds of voters agreeing on that in a Suffolk University poll earlier this month.\n\nHow serious the impact of a guilty verdict would be remains to be seen, but several polls have found Trump would likely lose some supporters if he were to be convicted. An ABC News-Ipsos survey from earlier this month found 16% of Trump supporters would reconsider their support and 4% would withdraw it if he were to be convicted of a felony.\n\n\"The question is, does it move the needle at all?\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"If he were to be found guilty, he he can say 'I told you so.' He's set himself up for an 'I told you' so moment and then if he's acquitted, he's gonna say 'I told you so' on that too.\"\n\nThe 2024 election is expected to be decided by slim margins, which means that it would only take a small chunk of voters defecting to Biden or another candidate to tip the results. How that will break down is mostly an unknown as most voters are still not tuned into the presidential election with more than five months to go and a constant cycle of Trump legal drama that has played out since last year has also muted its impact with the public.\n\n\"Most people don't know where the trial stands. A lot of people don't even know whether or not if you ask them whether Trump testified and is on trial, whether or not people know if he did or not, especially among independents, so there are a lot of there are a lot of unknowns out there,\" Paleologos said.\n\nThe other possible outcome is Trump not being convicted, a development that would be certain to become a central theme of his campaign. From its outset, Trump has railed against the New York case, the prosecutors pursuing it, the judge overseeing it and Biden over what the former president sees as being targeted by the justice system to deny him another term.\n\nThe White House and Biden's campaign have mostly stayed away from the Manhattan case, and the president has not directly addressed it very frequently. That changed as closing arguments began on Tuesday, with the Biden campaign hosting a press conference outside the courthouse while arguments were underway along with actor Robert De Niro and two former police officers who were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler said. \"We're here, primarily because of the threat that Donald Trump poses to the United States of America and to our democracy.\"\n\nTrump's campaign held their own press conference immediately after, arguing that the Biden campaign's presence proved their claims of a politicized justice system.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nBiden and Attorney General Merrick Garland have tried to restore a sense of independence to the Justice Department that some Americans saw slip during Trump's term, making few public statements about high-profile cases and appointing special prosecutors to investigations of Trump to limit the role of political influence in them.\n\nBut that has limited effect with Trump or his supporters, including members of Congress that have frequently held up the investigations of the former president as a weaponization of the justice system and launched their own probes into how the Justice Department has handled the sensitive cases.\n\nHigh-profile GOP members, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have traveled to New York to attend Trump's trial and offer their support. Many of them have used the opportunity to rail against the charges outside the courthouse, framing it as an effort to keep Trump off the campaign trail with bogus charges that add up to election interference.\n\n\"It's impossible for anybody to deny that looks at this objectively that the judicial system in our country has been weaponized against President Trump,\" Johnson said.", "source":

It was utterly humiliating for him, but it was all just a series of self-inflicted political wounds. It's nothing compared to what Trump is facing as today unfolds.\n\nTrump did everything he could to keep today from ever happening. He tried to rig his own reelection, and then incited a domestic terrorist attack, to try to stay in office so he couldn't be put on criminal trial. After getting booted from office, Trump and his team used every legal trick in the book to try to keep this trial from happening. And even as the trial has gone on, Trump has tried one feeble stunt after another to try to derail it.\n\nBut that was all for nothing, because here we are. Donald Trump's criminal trial, in terms of the prosecution's case and the defense's case, is over. All that's left is today's closing arguments. Given that the prosecution has put on an overwhelming and highly corroborated case, and the defense didn't put on anything that could even be called a case, there's nothing that can be said today to change what's already played out in this trial. Today is a formality. Barring a jury fluke, Trump has already lost.\n\nEven as today plays out, Trump will have to sit there in court - for the portions of it that he's awake at least - and ruminate on the fact that he's about to become a convicted felon. He's already whining on social media about how absurd it is that he's going to be labeled a \"common criminal.\" But he'd better get used to it.\n\nAs excruciating as it'll be for Trump to have to sit there helplessly today while prosecutors remind the jury of just how guilty he is, the one thing Trump has going for him today is that he's still not been convicted yet. Once the closing arguments end, Trump's fate will be in the hands of twelve people he's never met, twelve people whose names he'll never know, twelve people he can't retaliate against. And by the end of this week, Trump will very likely hear the word \"guilty\" thirty-four times.\n\nTrump won't fall through an immediate trap door once he's convicted. The judge will then have to decide what kind of punishment is on the table. Legal experts say that because these charges are the lowest level of felonies, they only result in a prison sentence about ten percent of the time. But given that Trump committed nearly three dozen of these lower level felonies, and the various other aggravating factors (including his misbehavior during the trial), the judge could indeed give him prison. Even if not, Trump could be looking at house arrest, probation, community service, an ankle bracelet, you name it.\n\nKeep in mind that as a convicted felon, Donald Trump will run into questions about whether he's even allowed to vote. That's right, Trump could be the first-ever presidential candidate who's legally prohibited from voting for himself. That's how absurd of a notion it is that Trump would still be a viable candidate after this conviction. Then there's the polling that says as many as 20% of Trump's current voters could decide not to vote for him if he's convicted. Remember, this was never about Trump's base, and only ever about the Republican voters outside Trump's base.\n\nIf the Republican National Convention really wants to go through with nominating Trump this summer after he becomes a convicted felon in this trial, so be it. That's their mistake to make. Again, this is a guy who's too senile to function in public, and whose campaign is being run by the kinds of idiots who just got him booed off the stage. Now he's about to be a convicted felon on top of it. And that's before getting to the one or two additional criminal trials that Trump could face before the election - each of which would come with far more serious felony charges and automatic lengthy prison sentences upon conviction.\n\nSo yeah, today is the worst day of Donald Trump's life so far. But it'll only get worse for him from here - and it'll get worse for him quickly.

I expect a \"GUILTY\" verdict, but only because the jury instructions as urged by the DA and adopted by the judge, over strenuous and well founded defense objections, virtually require conviction,\" Cobb said to Semafor.\n\n\"I reach this legal conclusion because of my long experience as a federal prosecutor and white collar defense lawyer, my reverence for the rule of law, and despite my view that Trump remains the greatest threat to Democracy in our nation's history,\" Cobb added.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Cobb for comment.\n\nTrump appeared in court on Tuesday in New York for his ongoing criminal trial brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump was indicted last April by Bragg, who said that the former president \"fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information -- including a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels -- from the public during the 2016 presidential campaign.\"\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has continued to deny any wrongdoing in the case, repeatedly calling it and other criminal and civil cases against him politically motivated.\n\nClosing arguments in the case began Tuesday morning, and a 12-person jury will begin their deliberations on Wednesday. But prior to handing it off to the panel, presiding Judge Juan Merchan will give jurors instructions on the law governing the case, a topic that was heavily debated by prosecutors and the defense team during the trial last week.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the jury instructions could include details of what the jurors can and can not take into account when making their decision of guilt or innocence.\n\nNewsweek's Katherine Fung, who has been inside the courtroom for Trump's trial, reported on Tuesday that the former president's attorney, Todd Blanche began his closing arguments by thanking the jurors for their service, being on time and paying close attention \"all day, everyday ... we really appreciate that.\"\n\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche says. \"He did not commit any crimes and the district attorney has not met the burden of proof, period.\" The evidence presented by prosecutors should leave jurors \"wanting more.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

Mentioning sentencing to gain sympathy with jurors who have no say in punishment \"is simply not allowed,\" he said, and that it was \"hard for me to imagine how that was not intentional.\"\n\nThe defense got more than a tongue-lashing. After lunch, Merchan turned to the jurors and told them why they had to ignore this sneaky move -- not a good final look for the defense.\n\nIn his three-hour closing argument, Blanche gave jurors a few places to explore reasonable doubt but mostly swung wildly and set up the prosecution for better arguments in the afternoon.\n\nMy favorite dumb moment: \"Guess who else you did not hear from in this trial?\" Blanche asked. \"Don and Eric. Is there some allegation that they are part of a conspiracy?\" No, counselor, but the jury will likely wonder why the defense called Robert Costello, who was destroyed on cross-examination, instead of Trump's own sons.\n\nBlanche huffed and puffed to discredit the two possible \"smoking guns\" offered by the prosecution. The first consists of the scrawled notes of Allen Weisselberg, former financial head of the Trump Organization, breaking down the $420,000 that Trump paid Cohen in 2017. Weisselberg wrote \"gross it up\" in reference to doubling the $130,000 in hush money for tax purposes. That \"is a lie,\" Blanche said, using a word he would employ more than 30 times in his closing argument, to diminishing effect.\n\nBut it wasn't a lie. The former controller of the Trump Organization had confirmed on the stand that the numbers and \"gross it up\" were in Weisselberg's own hand.\n\nThe other smoking gun involves a call Cohen taped, during which Trump said \"150\" in reference to the hush money for Karen McDougal. While trying and -- to my mind -- failing to establish that Cohen's phone was tampered with, Blanche played the tape and challenged the idea that Trump even said \"150\" and that Trump saying \"cash\" on the tape had anything to do with hush money. Jurors will presumably listen to the tape and decide for themselves. Believe me, you can hear \"150.\"\n\nBlanche ended his closing argument by telling jurors that if they focus on the evidence, \"this is a very easy and quick not-guilty.\" Insulting the jury's intelligence?

Merchan, in response, granted the prosecutors' request and called Blanche's comment \"outrageous.\"\n\n\"I think that saying that was outrageous,\" Merchan told Blanche. \"Someone who's been a prosecutor as long as you have and a defense attorney as long as you have, you know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate. It's simply not allowed. Period.\"\n\nCourts have long held that juries are not to consider penalties of a crime when determining whether prosecutors have proven beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed.\n\nIn his curative instruction, Merchan explained this to the jury in Trump's case and called Blanche's comment about prison \"improper.\"\n\n\"You must disregard it,\" Merchan said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nProsecutors also took issue with a comment Blanche made about a retainer agreement and asked Merchan to issue a second curative instruction on that, but Merchan denied that request.\n\nBlanche's comment about prison came as he was speaking about Michael Cohen, prosecutors' star witness in the case who provided the most direct evidence that Trump allegedly had knowledge of an illegal payment scheme to silence porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Cohen's evidence came in the form of testimony about his recollection of phone calls and meetings with Trump; however, Cohen's credibility has long been a glaring problem for prosecutors.\n\nCohen, Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax evasion, campaign finance violations, lying to a bank, and lying to Congress. He has since pursued a lucrative vendetta against Trump, raking in millions of dollars by selling books and speaking on podcast episodes about his disdain for his former boss.\n\nBlanche, as part of his closing arguments, tore into Cohen, telling jurors he is the \"the GLOAT, the greatest liar of all time.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nProsecutors began their closing arguments Tuesday afternoon. When they finish, Merchan will give the jury instructions about Trump's charges, and from there, the jury will begin deliberations.\n\nTrump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records, and each count carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.

Catch Up Here.", "body": "Closing arguments began Tuesday in the weekslong criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the first president to face prosecution in American history, in a case that stems from a hush-money deal to a porn star who said she had sex with him.\n\nMr. Trump faces several legal challenges related to his business and political activities, and the one underway in New York City was brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office. It could be the only case against him to go to trial before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe trial began in April and will be in the jurors' hands this week, following weeks of salacious testimony about sex scandals and granular detail about corporate documents. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all tied to the former president's role in a hush-money payment to the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe charges do not involve the hush deal itself but Mr. Trump's reimbursements for it to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who gave $130,000 to Ms. Daniels to buy her silence days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors said that the repayments were deliberately mislabeled as \"legal expenses\" in business ledgers to hide the deal.\n\nIf convicted, Mr. Trump faces probation or up to four years in prison.\n\nThat payoff was not the only such deal that prosecutors highlighted with the 20 witnesses they called to the stand. Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Trump had orchestrated a broader scheme to influence the 2016 presidential election by directing his allies to purchase damaging stories about him to keep them under wraps. The defense called two witnesses.\n\nMr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He also assailed the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, for bringing the charges, accusing him of carrying out a politically motivated witch hunt, and he has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28trump-trial-basics-01-ktch/28trump-trial-basics-01-ktch-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

(Jeenah Moon-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAs if as a final hurrah, Justice Juan Merchan scolds defendant Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche Tuesday -- the closing statements day in the Manhattan criminal court in the former president's hush money trials.\n\nIt all started as Blanche began to wrap up his nearly two hour-long closing argument. He tried to remind the jury that their decision shouldn't be influenced by their political or personal views of Trump and stressed that this is not a referendum on his candidacy. This was an interesting point to make since Trump and his campaign maintain that this entire trial is in fact a politically motivated sham that directly impacts the election.\n\nBut it was while thanking the jurors at the end of his remarks that Blanche made a mistake. He told them that if they remain attentive to the evidence presented in the courtroom, \"this is a very quick and easy 'not guilty' verdict.\" He also urged them not to send Trump t oprison\n\nAt that point, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass stood up and objected. \"That was a blatant and wholly inappropriate effort to call sympathy for their client,\" he said, requesting a curative instruction, The New York Times reported.\n\nThis is also when Merchan, who reportedly seemed furious, scolded Blanche for making an \"outrageous\" statement. He again reminded Blanche that, as a former prosecutor himself, he should know what is simply not allowed.\n\n\"Making a comment like that is highly inappropriate,\" he told Blanche before the court break for lunch. \"It's simply not allowed, period.\"\n\nThe reason why Blanche's remark is inappropriate is that he effectively misled jurors about the potential consequences of their voting to convict Trump, which could lead jury members to reconsider their decision in light of the claimed punishment. If found guilty, it will be Judge Merchan, not the jury, deciding what Trump's punishment should be - and it may not involve incarceration at all.\n\n\"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" Merchan told the jurors after lunch on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/todd_blanche_2152641654.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 120}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

In a candid interview which mirrors her testimony against the former US president, the adult film star recounts how she was initially at ease with Trump, before she alleges they had intercourse in a hotel room in 2006.\n\nShe says the pair discussed his daughter Ivanka, who had a prominent role on NBC's The Apprentice, and suggests she bonded with the real estate tycoon over the comparison. 'He told me I reminded him of his daughter. I feel like he was being sympathetic to me. Ivanka's beautiful and she's blonde and I'm sure she's had people assume she's an idiot.'\n\n'But I felt like as this father figure who has watched his daughter be treated a certain way [he] could identify with me. I thought we had this mutual respect.' She went on to say that this 'mutual respect' was 'why it was so crazy when having no red flags whatsoever in a conversation I came out of the bathroom to find myself cornered. 'I don't remember how I got on the bed. It was awful. But I didn't say no.'\n\nShe later said she wishes she had said 'no'. 'I told very few people that we had actually had [intercourse],' she testified. 'I felt ashamed that I didn't stop it, that I didn't say no.' Daniels said again during the trial that Trump told her in his hotel suite: 'You remind me of my daughter, she is smart, people underestimate her as well.' During their meeting, Daniels said that Trump also dangled a potential cameo for the star in The Apprentice after she got introduced to him as a film 'director.' That was one reason she said she kept in touch with Trump even after the encounter she said rattled her, the court was told.\n\nIn the documentary, which is airing on Channel 5 tonight, Daniels tells the interviewer that their initial encounter had been pleasant. 'Did I get any bad vibes or sexual innuendos? Nothing. He said: \"You're actually really smart\". 'Somehow the conversation about Celebrity Apprentice came up, and his argument was \"I will get a lot of attention for putting this blonde adult actress on TV\". 'And I was like \"NBC will never let me on television!\" And he's like 'every season I get to pick one person that they can't overrule, it's my wild card. 'So he spun it to me as 'You want to be a mainstream director... well this is a chance for you to be on TV and show people that you're not just what you look like.'\n\nThe documentary - titled Stormy - is directed by Sarah Gibson, and poses the question: 'What happens when you take on the most powerful man in the world?' It is airing to UK audiences at the same time as closing arguments are taking place across the pond in Manhattan. Prosecutors and defense attorneys have one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin.\n\nJurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former US president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that may have wrecked his 2016 presidential campaign. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was given to Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as 'legal expenses' to hide the true nature of the transactions. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. Closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday.\n\nThe case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It's unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

What Happens if Trump Is Convicted in His Hush-Money Case?", "body": "The presumptive Republican nominee for president might soon be a convicted criminal. It's unclear what would happen next\n\nDonald Trump's hush-money trial is nearing its end, and we could be days away from a jury convicting the presumptive Republican nominee for president on dozens of felony counts. Such a verdict would be unprecedented, just as it was unprecedented when the former president first stood criminal trial in April, and just as it was unprecedented last spring when Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged him with falsifying business records.\n\nThe indictment from Bragg was the first of four that have been leveled against Trump, and almost certainly the only that will head to trial before the election. It would also be unprecedented, of course, for a major-party nominee for the nation's highest office to be a convicted felon. There's a good chance this will in fact be the case this year, and that you might have a few questions about what it means for the election and beyond.\n\nYes. The only requirements to run for president are being 35 or older, being a natural-born citizen, and being a resident of the United States for 14 years. The nation's founders did not stipulate that Americans convicted of felonies related to paying a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair cannot run for president.\n\nProbably. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and convicted felons can only vote in Florida after they've completed their sentence -- which could mean serving jail time or simply paying a fine. Trump is unlikely to have completed his sentence by election time for a variety of reasons.\n\nTrump wasn't convicted in Florida, though, and Florida honors the voting eligibility laws of the state where the conviction occurs. New York only prohibits felons from voting when they are incarcerated, so unless Trump is behind bars on election day -- which is unlikely -- he'll probably be able to vote for himself in the Sunshine State.\n\nMaybe down the road, but it's unlikely Trump will wind up behind bars as a result of a guilty conviction in his hush-money case. Yes, he would be a convicted felon, but they're lower-level felonies and Trump has no previous criminal convictions, which means probation and/or a fine might be the more likely punishment.\n\nNevertheless, it's up to Judge Juan Merchan -- who has already threatened to jail Trump for violating his gag order -- and each of the 34 charges carries a maximum four-year prison sentence and $5,000 fine. It may be unusual for a conviction on these charges alone of someone with a clear record to result in jail time, but nothing about this case is usual.\n\nIt might be a while before punishment is meted out, however, as the former president's legal team -- which argues he could never receive a fair trial in New York City and that the prosecution was politically driven -- is standing at the ready to rush into the appeals process, which could be lengthy.\n\nJust as there's nothing in the rule book stating that a dog can't play basketball, there's nothing in the Constitution saying someone in jail can't be elected president.\n\nTrump might not have much recourse if he loses in November, but if he wins there are a number of ways he could leverage the federal government to keep himself out of jail. The Justice Department cases would be easy; he could just tell his hand-picked attorney general to toss them. The state cases are more difficult -- as Rolling Stone reported last week, he's currently lobbying Congress to pass a law that would protect the president from non-federal prosecution.\n\nTrump has long teased that he will weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies if wins back the White House, and Rolling Stone reported last year that his team has already trained its crosshairs on Bragg. Their sights have continued to focus on the Manhattan district attorney as the case has progressed.\n\n\"Mark my word: Alvin Bragg, [prosecutor] Matthew Colangelo, and many others will face criminal prosecution,\" Mike Davis, a lawyer and Trump ally, posted to X, formerly Twitter, in early May. (Members of Trump's inner sanctum have frequently discussed Davis as a top contender for senior roles, including at the Justice Department, in a possible second Trump administration.)\n\nDavis' words reflect a pervasive desire among the MAGA and GOP elite to go after those responsible for Trump's legal woes, with an array of attorneys and other Republicans close to Trump drawing up preliminary plans for different ways that the Justice Department could investigate or charge Bragg and other prosecutors who've brought cases against the ex-president, numerous sources tell Rolling Stone. Since last year, lawyers and others with Trump's ear have privately briefed him -- sometimes during parties at his club and estate -- on these retributive legal ideas, with Trump at times offering enthusiastic praise in response, sources add. In some instances, Trump has solicited more ideas. These discussions have continued well into 2024.\n\nAmong the ideas batted about by MAGA's legal brain trust, at times when Trump himself has been in the room, include the Justice Department deploying federal statutes, including Section 242 and Section 241 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, to investigate or prosecute Bragg for allegedly violating Trump's constitutional and civil rights.\n\nAnother popular idea in the upper echelons of Trumpland is for the Justice Department to criminally charge Bragg and other prosecutors for so-called \"election interference.\" This would exploit a different part of the criminal code that prohibits officials from using their \"authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting, the nomination or the election of any candidate for the office of president.\"\n\nIn April last year, Trump, in front of a cheering crowd, gave another reason when he publicly called for the district attorney to be prosecuted, claiming Bragg \"illegally leaked massive amounts\" of grand-jury information.\n\nBut when confronted with this in a Time magazine interview this year, Trump tried to say he never called for Bragg's prosecution, even though Trump did so on camera and in front of an audience.\n\nThe same way he's been responding to the trial itself, by alleging that the case is part of a political conspiracy orchestrated by President Joe Biden to hurt Trump's chances of defeating him in November. Trump has already been fundraising aggressively off his indictments -- including by splashing his mugshot in Georgia across merchandise -- and he will continue to do so if he is convicted in New York.\n\nAdvisers and allies close to Trump are convinced that the Manhattan jury pool won't be kind to Trump, and many of the former president's aides, lawyers, and political collaborators have long viewed a conviction as a foregone conclusion. They have been preparing accordingly.\n\nNamely, his 2024 campaign has prebaked an aggressive fundraising blitz that will give him ample opportunity to scream \"WITCH HUNT,\" \"ELECTION INTERFERENCE,\" and all of the other tag lines he's used to paint himself as a victim.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Cobb said he expects no more than four days of deliberation in the case. If his prediction is true, that signals a verdict could be ready by this Friday.\n\nMuch of the deliberation is expected to center on the testimony Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who testified that the former president instructed him to make the hush money payments.\n\nQuestions have surrounded Cohen's testimony given his prior conviction for lying under oath, and a harsh cross-examination by Trump's legal team earlier this month.\n\nIf he is convicted, the former president could face as much as four years in prison, as well as be named a felon.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_robertson@thehill.com", "name": "Nick Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ty Cobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White-collar crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Ty-Cobb-Donald-Trump-05.28.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The former presidents speaks outside of the courtroom.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing charges related to hush money payments, accused of falsifying business records to conceal payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHere are some similar high-profile hush money cases and their outcomes, providing a glimpse into what Trump might expect as the verdict of his trial is set to unfold.\n\nRELATED: A guide to Trump's court cases\n\nWhile Trump's case is unique, he's certainly not the first high-profile individual to have faced charges related to hush money payments. Notably, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, was sentenced to three years in prison for his involvement in payments to silence women alleging affairs with Trump. Cohen's case is often cited as a significant precedent in Trump's ongoing legal challenges.\n\nCharges related to hush money payments have significantly impacted the careers and reputations of those involved.\n\nIndividuals like John Edwards, a former U.S. Senator, faced severe reputational damage despite being acquitted. The scandal effectively ended his political career, including a role as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 and a promising candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.\n\nThe misuse of campaign funds to cover up his extramarital affair led to widespread public condemnation and relentless media scrutiny, overshadowing his political achievements. The affair also caused significant personal consequences, including a strained marriage that led to a separation from his wife, Elizabeth Edwards. The long-term impact of the scandal illustrates how even an acquittal can result in lasting damage to both personal and professional reputations.\n\nR. Kelly, the R&B singer, faced a highly publicized legal battle involving allegations of sexual abuse and illicit payments to silence his accusers. Kelly's case has drawn parallels to Trump's, with both involving efforts to cover up damaging information and the defense focusing on discrediting key witnesses. The burden of proof rested heavily on the prosecution in both instances.\n\nCohen, Trump's former lawyer, faced significant legal repercussions for his involvement in hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including campaign finance violations, tax evasion, and lying to Congress.\n\nHe admitted to arranging payments to Daniels and McDougal to silence their allegations of affairs with Trump, aiming to influence the 2016 election. Cohen was fined and sentenced to three years in federal prison.\n\nCohen's testimony has been crucial in the ongoing trial against Trump, offering detailed accounts of the payments and the subsequent cover-up efforts. He has described how the payments were made and the involvement of Trump and other associates in the alleged scheme.\n\nRELATED: Could Trump really go to jail? Does he expect to?\n\nDespite his cooperation with federal investigators, Cohen has been heavily scrutinized by Trump's defense team, who have tried to discredit him by emphasizing his history of dishonesty and legal troubles, including instances where he lied under oath.\n\nEdwards, a former U.S. Senator and vice-presidential candidate, faced charges for using campaign contributions to conceal an extramarital affair with Rielle Hunter, a videographer for his 2008 presidential campaign. In his 2012 trial, Edwards was acquitted on one charge of accepting illegal campaign contributions, while the jury was deadlocked on five other counts, resulting in a mistrial. The Justice Department subsequently decided not to retry him.\n\nAlthough Edwards avoided prison, the trial severely damaged his reputation and effectively ended his political career. The extensive media coverage and public scrutiny of the affair and the misuse of campaign funds overshadowed his previous political achievements.\n\nEdwards, once a rising star in the Democratic Party with a compelling personal story and significant support, saw his political ambitions shattered. The scandal not only impacted his professional life but also his personal life, leading to a separation from his wife, who was battling cancer at the time.\n\nKelly faced multiple charges, including coordinating hush money payments to silence victims of his alleged sexual misconduct. In 2008, he was acquitted of child pornography charges, partly due to alleged payments made to keep witnesses from testifying. However, his legal troubles resurfaced with more serious charges in subsequent years.\n\nIn 2021, Kelly was convicted in a federal racketeering and sex trafficking trial in New York, where he was sentenced to 31 years in prison. He was found guilty of leading a scheme to recruit women and underage girls for sexual exploitation. Additionally, he faced charges in Chicago for child pornography and obstruction of justice and in Minnesota for engaging in prostitution with a minor. His financial struggles and deteriorating health conditions have compounded his legal issues.\n\nTrump's case is unique because he is the first former American president to face criminal charges. Legal experts suggest that while the charges are serious, the outcomes could differ from past cases due to the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former president.\n\nThe defense did not attempt to demonstrate Trump's innocence but focused on attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses. Cohen's testimony placed Trump at the center of an alleged scheme to suppress damaging stories during his White House bid.\n\nThe trial's next steps include closing arguments on May 28 and subsequent jury instruction.\n\nThe closing arguments are the final chance for each side to persuade the jury to convict or acquit. The prosecution is expected to highlight supportive evidence, and the defense will emphasize inconsistencies in witness testimonies. The jury will then deliberate, potentially as early as Wednesday, May 29.", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

He tried to remind the jury that their decision shouldn't be influenced by their political or personal views of Trump and stressed that this is not a referendum on his candidacy. This was an interesting point to make since Trump and his campaign maintain that this entire trial is in fact a politically motivated sham that directly impacts the election.\n\nBut it was while thanking the jurors at the end of his remarks that Blanche made a mistake. He told them that if they remain attentive to the evidence presented in the courtroom, \"this is a very quick and easy 'not guilty' verdict.\" He also urged them not to send Trump t oprison\n\nAt that point, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass stood up and objected. \"That was a blatant and wholly inappropriate effort to call sympathy for their client,\" he said, requesting a curative instruction, The New York Times reported.\n\nThis is also when Merchan, who reportedly seemed furious, scolded Blanche for making an \"outrageous\" statement. He again reminded Blanche that, as a former prosecutor himself, he should know what is simply not allowed.\n\n\"Making a comment like that is highly inappropriate,\" he told Blanche before the court break for lunch. \"It's simply not allowed, period.\"\n\nThe reason why Blanche's remark is inappropriate is that he effectively misled jurors about the potential consequences of their voting to convict Trump, which could lead jury members to reconsider their decision in light of the claimed punishment. If found guilty, it will be Judge Merchan, not the jury, deciding what Trump's punishment should be - and it may not involve incarceration at all.\n\n\"That comment was improper and you must disregard it,\" Merchan told the jurors after lunch on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LWbkkFYlWCBiMFLstZFRQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/d587743e8c64dcb7b64d8d1ea964d79d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

If Trump is found guilty, where does that leave Republicans like me?", "body": "Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, testified on the alleged Stormy Daniels pay-off Trump told him \"just to do it.\"\n\nWill Republicans vote for Donald Trump even if he's found guilty?\n\nThis could be the quandary for Republicans if the former president is convicted in the hush money trial. It could raise important legal, ethical and political questions - or at least it should - about Trump's candidacy and our willingness to vote for him. A verdict could come this week after Tuesday's closing arguments.\n\nRepublicans' views of Trump have already shifted. A May PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll shows that 46% say Trump has acted unethically. This number has jumped 12 points since February. This is a hint that the trial has tarnished Trump's reputation in the eyes of Republicans. But to what extent?\n\nConservatives like me have to start asking tough questions about Trump\n\nIf Trump is found guilty, MAGA Republicans will reframe this as a win, suggesting this bolsters their original conspiracy theories about the left's use of lawfare as a way to prevent Trump from winning again. They will nod their MAGA-capped heads and say in unison: See? We told you so! It was all a giant conspiracy!\n\nHowever, if Trump is found guilty, conservatives who are not pro-Trump or hard-right MAGA fans (like myself) will face the hardest question of all. Who will conservatives who, like me, dislike Trump and President Joe Biden vote for? Will we vote at all?\n\nTrump is the best we have? Trump is ruining the GOP with his lawlessness. Republicans like me deserve better.\n\nA guilty verdict could push Republicans like me into a corner to reckon with our conscience. Do we choose someone who acts unethically and illegally but is a \"conservative\" because even that is better than a Democrat?\n\nAs of now, I don't think I could justify voting for Biden.\n\nDisliking Trump doesn't mean we can vote for Biden\n\nBiden has derailed this country's social fabric with executive decisions like revising Title IX and offering billions in student loan forgiveness.\n\nThanks to his \"Build Back Better\" plan, inflation is still higher than it was a few years ago, and his administration has already pledged to increase taxes on wealthy people and corporations.\n\nOne could argue that optics are the least important thing about a president, but perception matters when you're the leader of the free world. Biden's incompetence, incoherence and weakness fail to communicate the right message to allies and enemies around the world.\n\nFor many Republicans, this is enough to withhold their vote. For single-issue voters, like many evangelicals, Biden's pro-abortion stance is enough not to vote for him regardless of how they feel about Trump.\n\nGreat job, Biden! Social Security is going broke and debt payments are breaking the bank.\n\nBut some conservatives do have reservations about Trump and what it means if we support him in November.\n\nShould a Republican choose Biden - someone we know is not a conservative and who we believe is actively derailing the country's economy, reputation and social fabric - just to avoid Trump?\n\nFor some Republicans, this answer is easy: Never vote Democrat. Ever. For the rest of us conservatives, Trump is so awful for the GOP and for democracy - he's just so loathsome and narcissistic - that with or without a guilty verdict, we will struggle to vote for him. This raises questions about the importance of idealizing party over country.\n\nDo Republicans choose conscience or compromise?\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley answered that question when she announced Wednesday that she would vote for Trump, even though she previously said he's \"not qualified\" to lead the nation. This is a position one would expect Haley, as a known Republican leader, to take.\n\nMany, many Republican leaders will vote for Trump even if they think he's not qualified, even if the jury does find him guilty, because they are casting their vote, in their minds, against Biden rather than for Trump.\n\nRepublicans in this precarious position must weigh whether or not a guilty verdict in a hush money trial is as bad as a president who we believe incoherent and unethical.\n\nDo Republicans think that, if elected, Trump will be a worse president than Biden? This is tricky to answer and depends on your worldview and values, and what you think a president is responsible for doing.\n\nWhat voting for Trump means for Republicans who can't support Biden\n\nTrump lies, obfuscates and constantly changes his story. He maintains the image as a Republican for the people when really he's an elitist charming fraud who is deceitful, immoral and lacks principles.\n\nUnlike 2016, we now have a clearer picture of Trump. Conservatives know there are clearly two versions of him in the White House. One that champions religious liberty, tries to grow the economy with tax cuts and appoints originalist justices to the Supreme Court. Another apparently pays off lovers, lies about classified documents and maintains that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIt was one thing for Trump to have a decent presidency, but another for him to maintain that the last presidential election was rigged and support the riot that ensued at the nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was one thing to claim the election was stolen but another to test that with lawsuits in a handful of states and be proven wrong over and over.\n\nA vote for Trump is an acknowledgment that we condone this. Do we? Is it OK to vote for this because we don't like higher taxes? Do we let him maintain the election was rigged against all evidence to the contrary because we don't like a massive, costly student loan forgiveness plan?\n\nA Republican might say that we cast a ballot for Trump in good conscience because even if he's guilty, he's better than Biden, a Democrat. If, as a Republican, I think Biden is awful, and I do, how could I possibly think Trump is better? He's clearly not. But still, I can't vote for Biden.\n\nDemocrats and MAGA won't face this ethical decision. Their minds are made up. But a sect of conservatives - large enough to matter - will wrestle with this.\n\nA guilty verdict will make things harder for us.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA

Cohen alleges hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels were made through him and Trump was aware of the agreement. Trump has denied all of this.\n\n\"The phrase I think you're going to find in that transcript more than any other is 'reasonable doubt.' This was not an innocence defense. This was not someone getting up and saying, 'my client's never done anything wrong in his life.' This was entirely a reasonable doubt defense,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell said Blanche described Cohen as the \"embodiment of reasonable doubt.\" At one point Blanche said no man should be sent to prison \"on the word of Michael Cohen.\" As O'Donnell noted, none of Trump's 30 felony counts carry a minimum sentence. Blanche was scolded for the comment about potential imprisonment and told by Merchan he \"knew\" what he was doing, accusing him of putting unneeded pressure on the jury.\n\n\"Todd Blanche was admonished by the judge for that after the jury left the room, and the judge did say that he would issue a curative to the jury specifically about what Todd Blanche said in that moment,\" O'Donnell recounted.\n\nThe reporter argued the defense's arguments fall short because they don't provide a specific explanation for payments made to Cohen that were simply labeled as legal expenses. Still, O'Donnell said Blanche's \"strongest point\" in his closing argument was arguing reasonable doubt through Cohen, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and other charges in 2018.\n\nO'Donnell argued the case will come down to the trust jurors have in Cohen, as well as how much doubt there is about Trump being directly aware of the purpose of the invoices he was signing. A bookkeeper testified he \"sometimes\" did not know what certain invoices were meant for.\n\n\"The most important element of reasonable doubt for them that they're trying to create is, did Donald Trump know about the payments to Stormy Daniels? Did he approve those payments in October of 2016?\" O'Donnell said. \"And that's where they're placing all of their reasonable doubt weight -- and Todd Blanche did about as good of a job as you could do with the facts as they stand on that particular point.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jansing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Tur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katy Tur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Qualitative_Physics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Qualitative Physics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/larry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

It was a terrific time,\" Trump said in his WWE Hall of Fame speech, referring to WrestleManias IV and V, which the then-World Wrestling Federation staged in Atlantic City, in a convention hall next to Trump's Trump Plaza hotel and casino. (Trump Plaza fell into disrepair during the 2010s and was imploded in 2021.)\n\nTrump wasn't satisfied with one stint as president, either, so he's attempting to become the second former president -- Grover Cleveland was the first -- to win two non-consecutive terms.\n\nALSO READ: 8 ways Trump doesn't become president\n\nAnd Trump's second impeachment acquittal in two years helped embolden him to again run for president. \"Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nSo it's no surprise that Trump agreed to debates against Biden -- one in June on CNN, the next in September on ABC. It's the same number -- two -- that the two men participated in during the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n\"To this day, it has the highest ratings, the highest pay-per-view, in the history of wrestling of any kind. I'm very honored by that. And perhaps that's why I'm being inducted,\" Trump said of his \"Battle of the Billionaires\" proxy match with then-WWE CEO Vince McMahon at WrestleMania 23.\n\nThe match ended up with McMahon getting his head shaved -- and Trump being slammed to the canvas by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin.\n\nA spectacle it certainly was -- one that allowed Trump to engage in a most cherished pastime: boasting about how he alone can make or break a televised event.\n\nSince the first Trump-Biden 2024 debate is scheduled to air on CNN -- and will not be broadcast on all national networks simultaneously as was standard practice for Commission on Presidential Debates-sanctioned debates -- viewership could be massive.\n\nAnd given that Trump has endlessly ragged \"failing\" CNN for its ratings, bet that Trump will use the first debate as proof -- if there is proof to be had -- that he alone has captured the imagination of America's body politic.\n\n\"Tough. Tough people. Thank you very much everybody,\" a smirking Trump said as the crowd booed him as he started his WWE speech.\n\n\"I really do love you people, even the ones that don't like me so much,\" Trump said in conclusion, as a version of The O'Jay's hit song, \"For the Love of Money,\" reverberated through the arena.\n\nWriting for The Baffler, Mike Edison defined a wrestling \"heel\" as such: \"The role of a heel is to get 'heat,' which means spurring the crowd to obstreperous hatred, and generally involves cheating and pretty much any other manner of socially unacceptable behavior that will get the job done.\"\n\nALSO READ: How Trump could run for president from jail\n\nAnd to paraphrase the late wrestling legend Gorilla Monsoon: Trump resembles that remark.\n\nTrump -- ever the provocateur -- will almost certainly avoid the high road en route to the June debate in Atlanta as he bills himself as Biden's physical and mental superior.\n\nFor example, a lectern nearly toppled over while Trump delivered a recent speech in Minnesota. Trump posted to social media: \"As far as the podium, I actually stopped it from falling due to good reflexes and strength, two elements which Joe Biden does not possess.\"\n\n\"Now, Vince has been trying for the last six years to break our pay-per-view record. He's had some great people on. But it's not going to happen. And the same enthusiasm and love that you have for me tonight -- I feel it. That's why you all came down to watch me get my ass kicked and my head shaved, but it didn't happen,\" Trump bragged to the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony crowd, which again showered him with jeers.\n\nCompare that to Trump's acceptance last week of Biden's debate challenge.\n\n\"I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social account.\n\n\"It's time for a debate so that he can explain to the American People his highly destructive Open Border Policy, new and ridiculous EV Mandates, the allowance of Crushing Inflation, High Taxes, and his really WEAK Foreign Policy, which is allowing the World to 'Catch on Fire,'\" Trump continued. \"I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September.\"\n\nTrump added: \"I would strongly recommend more than two debates and, for excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds -- That's only because he doesn't get them. Just tell me when, I'll be there. 'Let's get ready to Rumble!!!'\"\n\n\"I will challenge Vince next year to a fight. And I will kick his ass. If he wants. I will kick his ass!\" Trump bellowed in reference to McMahon.\n\nDespite his bluster, Trump did not pursue another \"battle of the billionaires\" melee. Rather, Trump went into political business with McMahon's wife, Linda McMahon, who would later become a Trump megadonor and his administrator of the federal Small Business Administration.\n\nLittle of this is surprising -- and speaks to how Trump's political career, like his pro wrestling dalliance, is peppered with backtracks, flip-flops and about-faces.\n\nConsider that Trump has been a Democrat, independent and Reform Party member before becoming a Republican.\n\nHe used to donate money to A-list liberals before strictly supporting conservatives.\n\nHe first flirted with a run for president in 1988. Ahead of Election 2000, at the behest of former pro wrestler and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, Trump briefly sought the presidency as a Reform Party candidate, but quit. Trump flirted again with a run ahead of Election 2012 before withdrawing from consideration after \"considerable deliberation and reflection.\" He even publicly pondered running for governor of New York in 2014, then didn't.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been all over the map on issues such as abortion, Social Security, Medicare, gun background checks and a host of others.\n\nAnd lest we forget, Trump nixed a scheduled debate between himself and Biden on Oct. 15, 2020. Trump simply refused to participate in what would have been a virtual event -- the Commission on Presidential Debates made it such because Trump, who had contracted COVID-19 earlier that month at a time when vaccines weren't yet available, declined to say whether he had tested negative for the virus.\n\nDon't chisel the June 27 Biden-Trump debate in granite. There's still plenty of time for Trump to withdraw.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trump's personal freedom at risk and his political fortunes in the balance, lawyers on both sides of his criminal trial mounted a final flurry of arguments on Tuesday to sway the 12 New Yorkers who will soon decide his legal fate.\n\nMr. Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, went first. And he came out swinging at the prosecution's case, which centers on the accusation that Mr. Trump falsified records to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star. The case, the first criminal prosecution of an American president, is \"absurd\" and \"preposterous,\" and it \"makes no sense,\" Mr. Blanche argued.\n\nJoshua Steinglass, the prosecutor who delivered the state's closing argument after Mr. Blanche finished, fired back at the defense's attacks on \"our integrity.\" He argued that Mr. Trump's lawyers, not the prosecution, had played games with the evidence. And Mr. Trump, he said, \"not only corrupted those around him, but he got them to lie to cover it up\" -- including faking the records that underpin the case.\n\nMr. Blanche, across a sprawling and sometimes disjointed closing argument, aimed attacks at the prosecution's bedrock contention that the records were false, and that Mr. Trump was responsible for creating them. But Mr. Blanche saved his harshest criticism for the prosecution's star witness, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer. It was he who paid off the porn star, Stormy Daniels, in a hush-money deal in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPortraying Mr. Cohen as a greedy liar bent on revenge, Mr. Blanche assailed his credibility and claimed that the defense had caught him testifying falsely about Mr. Trump's knowledge of the deal.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/28/multimedia/28trump-ledeall-hptw/28trump-ledeall-hptw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

That information was the outright false accusations that Trump was colluding with the Russians.\n\nSussmann affirmatively stated to the FBI that he was acting independently and not on behalf of the Clinton campaign.\n\nThis was proven false by the fact that he billed the Clinton campaign for his meeting laying out these false accusations.\n\nThere was no doubt that this was a crime.\n\nThe charges were taken so seriously that the FBI authorized the spying on Trump's campaign and placing a cloud over Trump's presidency.\n\nBut if the evidence was so overwhelming that Sussmann had committed a crime, why did the jury acquit him?\n\nFirstly, the judge issued rulings that limited the jury's consideration of Sussmann's lie in the overall conspiracy to aid Clinton in the campaign.\n\nThe judge's wife was a lawyer for Lisa Paige, the FBI operative who concocted the \"insurance policy\" to knock Trump out of office if he were to miraculously get elected.\n\nIt's no wonder the judge didn't want to allow the greater conspiracy to be heard in his court. It might've highlighted his conflict.\n\nSecondly, that lack of context led to a juror admitting she ignored the facts, because:\n\n\" . . . we have better time or resources to use or spend to other things that affect the nation as a whole than a possible lie to the FBI.\"\n\nSo now we see how the Trump verdict may suffer a similar fate.\n\nThe Trump trial judge, Juan Merchan, is conflicted as his daughter -- a Democratic operative -- stands to reap financial benefit with a Trump verdict.\n\nThe Bragg prosecution should never have been brought for numerous reasons.\n\n1)...The payment to Stormy Daniels was not a campaign contribution, so there was no requirement that it be filed as such.\n\nA campaign contribution is something that is solely for campaign purposes, such as buying buttons or conducting a poll. It's not for a nondisclosure settlement with a paramour who can embarrass the subject's family or trigger a moral clause in his TV deal.\n\nThe feds failure to convict John Edwards on paying his paramour is proof that there was no legal predicate to the Trump charge.\n\n2)...Unlike the Trump hush money, which was not a campaign expenditure, Clinton's payment to Sussmann to dirty up Trump was indeed a campaign expenditure.\n\nBut Clinton did not want her fingerprints on Sussmann's meeting with the FBI, so she filed it as a \"legal expense,\" just as Michael Cohen's payoff was.\n\nThe FEC fined the Clinton campaign, but did not indict her, or raid her home.\n\nThey didn't even charge Sussmann for the improper filing.\n\nThey charged him for lying to the FBI. The same charge that led to numerous Republicans being jailed, including Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos, and yes, even Michael Cohen.\n\n3) . . . But even if it was considered a payment that had to be filed for campaign purposes, it's not clear how it should be classified on the report. If it's not a legal expense, what should it be labeled as?\n\n4) . . . And even if it was improperly filed, there had to be a link to Trump to prove that he knew about it, and knew it to be illegal, but promoted it anyway.\n\nThere was absolutely no evidence to make any link to Trump, except for a statement from Cohen that he told Trump of the payment in a phone call.\n\nBut in a jaw-dropping moment on cross examination, it was revealed that that call was actually with the Secret Service agent to complain about prank phone calls to Cohen.\n\nAt that stage alone, the case should've been dismissed. Alas, it was not, and will not be.\n\nSo it goes to a jury in the nation's deepest blue election precinct. If anyone thinks jury nullification is not a strong possibility here, they haven't been paying attention.\n\nSteve Levy is President of Common Sense Strategies, a political consulting firm.

During a lunch recess after the pitch, the judge in charge of the case briefly upbraided the former president's counsel for a wayward reference to punishment.\n\nThe narrative theme delivered to jurors was that Michael Cohen, 57, the state's star witness, simply cannot be trusted.\n\nThe defense reminded the assembled Manhattan arbiters of facts that Cohen was an admitted, serial liar - using a permutation of the acronym G.O.A.T. to call Cohen the Greatest Liar Of All Time - and alleged that Cohen committed several instances of perjury during the trial, lying to each and every juror, in order to implicate Trump and shore up other pieces of his, at-times uneven, testimony.\n\n\"You cannot send somebody to prison, you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said, finishing his sentence over a sustained objection from the prosecution.\n\nThe defense was allowed to finish their closing argument without additional interruption, but when the jury left for lunch and just the lawyers and the judge remained in the courtroom, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass raised a motion for a curative instruction.\n\nThe complaining prosecutor characterized the defense's reference to prison as \"blatant and wholly inappropriate effort to gain sympathy\" for Trump, according to a courtroom report by CBS News.\n\n\"There's no requirement of prison,\" Steinglass added, according to a report by Just Security fellow Adam Klasfeld.\n\nMore Law&Crime coverage: 'Are you missing my point?': Trump attorney sharply upbraided by judge after jury goes home in hush-money trial\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan agreed with the prosecution, calling the comment \"outrageous\" and saying the remark was unlikely to have been accidental on Blanche's part.\n\n\"You know that making a comment like that is highly inappropriate,\" the judge added. \"It's simply not allowed.\"\n\nIn granting the instruction, Merchan said the jurors would be apprised of the defense's slip-up after coming back from lunch.\n\nMore Law&Crime coverage: 'Are you staring me down right now?': Furious judge in Trump hush-money trial clears the courtroom as defense witness gripes about court's rulings and asks to 'strike' the record\n\nBefore the state begin their own predicted-be-much-longer closing statement, Assistant District Attorney Susan Hoffinger said the defense was explicitly on notice about mentioning potential punishment by way of a pretrial ruling issued by the court in March that discussed - and expressly forbade - exactly that topic.\n\n\"Defendant is precluded from...making arguments and introducing evidence regarding any potential punishment or other consequences to the Defendant as a result of these proceedings,\" the order read.\n\nBlanche did not object to the curative instruction.\n\nThe judge, in turn, told the jury they could not consider potential punishment when rendering their verdict, noting that prison time is not a mandatory feature of a conviction on the charges at issue.\n\nWhile prison is technically a possibility in the case, it's no guarantee to be meted out to Trump in the event of a conviction.\n\nA Class E, non-violent felony is considered the least severe felony under New York law. Likely punishments for first-time offenders - which Trump would be if convicted - include no jail time at all, probation, or, a sentence of between one and four years behind bars.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_School_of_Law", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York University School of Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24149509052307.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

He would have ended the case quickly by explaining the Law and stating that President Trump did nothing wrong,\" Trump said, asking why defense witness Robert Costello was \"so horribly treated.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_backus@newsweek.com", "name": "Alex Backus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump Tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2396769/view-court.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=7adbe69a3fe0e72fac0255033e2055d0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

He wrote that the Manhattan courtroom where New York Supreme Court justice Juan Merchan has been presiding over the trial is constantly abuzz with a hodgepodge of both high-profile news anchors like CNN's Jake Tapper and Fox News' Jeanine Pirro, along with \"veteran court reporters and exhausted print journalists operating on little sleep.\" Another person apparently not getting enough sleep is the 45th president of the United States, who Woodward said often has trouble keeping his eyes open for most of the day.\n\n\"After snaking through two lines for metal detectors downstairs, up the elevators back to the 15th floor, through another two rows of bag checks and another set of metal detectors, we filed back into the courtroom before the former president trudged inside and plopped himself at the defense table,\" Woodward wrote, describing the immediate aftermath of a man self-immolating outside of the courthouse during the last day of jury selection.\n\nREAD MORE: 'He sets people off': Here's what prospective hush money jurors said about Trump\n\n\"There, we continued to bear witness to a silent and tired Trump, who slouches, stares and keeps his eyes shut for six to seven hours a day, three to four days a week -- a view that's been afforded to only his entourage and the handfuls of attorneys, court officers, journalists and members of the public allowed inside,\" he continued. \"He lumbers in and out of the court, sits briefly by himself at the defense table before his attorneys join him, then keeps his eyes closed for most of the day.\"\n\n\"His mouth falls open occasionally, before he appears to snap awake and scrunch his face as if he's listening harder,\" he added. \"He sinks into his chair and disappears, barely a witness to his own trial.\"\n\nDuring multiple occasions, other journalists have also noted Trump's pattern of falling asleep during the proceedings that will determine his freedom. Earlier this month, MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin said the former president's lawyers tried \"a number of different devices to keep Trump awake,\" with mixed results.\n\n\"When there are sidebars, an attorney doesn't leave his side anymore, because leaving him alone means leaving him to potentially sleep. He has a stack of papers with him at all times now to go through. But neither of those things seem to have protected Trump from his own exhaustion,\" Rubin said. \"More than not, when I looked up to see how Trump was receiving the testimony, Trump was not receiving it all, because his eyes were closed.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Such low energy': Trump relentlessly mocked for once again falling asleep during trial\n\nBoth the prosecution and the defense are back in court after the Memorial Day weekend to make their closing arguments. Defense counsel Todd Blanche is currently presenting his closing arguments to the jury, and prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office will follow.\n\nJury deliberations will begin after both sides have presented their closing arguments. Last week, Politico legal correspondent Josh Gerstein said he didn't expect jurors to take more than two or three days to decide on a verdict.\n\nTrump is facing 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. Judge Merchan has told jurors that while they must unanimously agree that Trump falsified records in each of the 34 counts to cover up a separate \"predicate crime,\" they didn't have to all agree on what crime was allegedly being covered up.\n\nClick here to read Woodward's full essay in the Independent.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metal detector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanine_Pirro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeanine Pirro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailiff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bailiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=52172791&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It's also made of \"METAL.\"\n\nDownside: You may be a fool if you believe that metal is really gold. You'll also get more mileage from any credit, debit, ATM or senior discount card found in your wallet.\n\nThe \"TRUMP 2024 BALLOT DEFENDER PLATINUM LEVEL METAL LIMITED EDITION\" is advertised to a \"TOP SUPPORTER\" who has earned Trump's \"PLATINUM RATING.\"\n\nThat Trump's campaign sent it to anyone subscribed to his email list, including journalists, should provide adequate evidence about its exclusiveness.\n\nJust like the gold card and the platinum card. Except it's black.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment.\n\nAmong the questions Raw Story asked Trump's team: What are the differences among these cards other than the color? Do donors receive a physical card in the mail upon making a donation or just a digital image they can print out at home? How long does it take for someone to receive a card if physical cards are offered? Is there a minimum amount one must donate to receive a card? Do the cards entitle the bearer to any benefits or perks, and if so, what?\n\nA \"2024 Trump Life Membership\" might seem like a pretty sweet deal. After all, this membership is being offered to you by a man who owns hotels and golf courses and luxury resorts.\n\nUnfortunately, the \"life membership\" comes with a 100 percent guarantee that if you enter Mar-a-Lago using this as your lone credential, your visit will be brief.\n\nIf diamonds are forever, why not just get a Trump life membership and save yourself some confusion?\n\nThis will signify your membership to what Trump is calling the \"Trump National Committee\" -- a joint fundraising arrangement between Trump's presidential campaign committee and the Republican National.\n\nExcited to support a self-styled \"day one\" dictator but aren't ready for a full-time gig?\n\nBuy your way onto the \"2024 Trump Advisory Board\" and become a \"trusted\" adviser to the man who wants to become our nation's 47th president.\n\nBut rest assured that if you do, the person who Trump is pictured talking to on the phone will not be you.\n\nA cool $35 will snag you this gig. No details whatsoever on what rights or responsibilities this will entail.\n\nMost of the members of Trump's presidential Cabinet aren't too jazzed about the former president again seeking the White House.\n\nEnter the \"OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN CABINET.\"\n\nThis new Cabinet \"will be made up of my most ELITE, PATRIOTIC, and TRUSTED supporters that are up for the ULTIMATE challenge - providing my team and I with valuable insight and advice as we make some of the most important decisions leading up to the 2024 Presidential Election and BEYOND,\" Trump writes.\n\nWhat's the catch? Just donate \"ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY,\" and you, too, can start channeling your inner Wilbur Ross and begin taking lots of naps. (Trump might even say you're as \"dumb as a rock.\")\n\nOh, you think you're special because you're in the Official Trump Campaign Cabinet?\n\nTurns out that folks in the \"Official Trump 47 Club\" also get invited to be among the \"select few Patriots\" who Trump will \"rely on and will provide me with the insight and support to RECLAIM America.\"\n\nFor those who really love element No. 79 but need more than a card.\n\nFor those who really love element No. 78 but need more than a card.\n\n\"To be certain that we have a consistent stream of funds every single month, I'm asking you to become a Sustaining Member of our 2024 presidential campaign by making a monthly contribution of any amount ... even $1 or $5,\" Trump writes.\n\nThe membership does not appear to come with a public television-esque tote bag or John Tesh CD. (Sad!)\n\nSo what, exactly, does this particular membership, or any Trump these memberships, entitle one who is granted a membership?\n\nDo different memberships come with different benefits, if they come with any benefit at all?\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment.\n\nFor years now, Trump's campaign has been promising a \"select\" group of supporters that they would have their name etched on a \"wall\" in Trump's office.\n\nPerhaps forgetting that they've run this promotion before, or perhaps hoping that supporters themselves have forgotten this fact, Trump is again promising to \"build a beautiful wall at my office dedicated to a select group of donors who stepped up at this critical time.\"\n\nLike another wall -- say, one on the southern border -- it'd be reasonable to question why the Trump Donor Wall hasn't already been built.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Mexico can't pay for the Trump Donor Wall, because foreign campaign contributions are illegal, per federal election law.\n\nIf Trump seems to be putting the \"meh\" in memberships, he's got something way cooler -- ambassadorships!\n\nGet ready to channel your inner Benjamin Franklin, Anthony Wayne Jerome Phillips-Spencer or Spock when you \"secure your status as an Official 45 Ambassador before it's too late.\"\n\nNo, you will not have access to a State Department jet or even \"Trump Force One.\"\n\nSo, you've already got a Trump gold card. And you're also a Trump Gold Club member.\n\nBut like Trump himself, you really, really love gold.\n\n\"Golden Trump Patriots like you WILL BE THE REASON we take back our Country from the WORST, and most CORRUPT, President in HISTORY,\" Trump explains in offering this opportunity.\n\nGolden Trump Status may be achieved for the low, low pyrite-esque price of $20.24, according to a Trump campaign email.\n\nAmericans of a certain age may remember those grifty letters your parents would receive via U.S. mail informing them that their little Johnny or Katie had been named to the Who's Who of Upper Midwestern Left-Handed 7th Graders.\n\nJust send a check for $99 plus shipping and handling and the publisher would send back a book where your name -- misspelled, of course -- would appear in four-point font on page 743, printed on paper half a micron thick.\n\nThe America First Lifetime Achievement Award for Patriotism appears to work similarly.\n\nEven though the invitation states that Donald Trump Jr., the former president's own son, has nominated you for this \"MAGA Movement Honor,\" there's a catch.\n\n\"$35 -- DONATE THIS AMOUNT TO ACCEPT\" a black button with white letters informs you when you click to accept the award.\n\nOne day, you're watching a football game in your wood-paneled basement rec room, and you decide the vintage, autographed posters of Bernie Kosar and Cheryl Tiegs look a bit ... dated. Time for an upgrade.\n\nLucky for you, a modest campaign donation will snag you a \"signed poster from Donald J. Trump, the best President of all time!\"\n\nUnlucky for you, Trump's signature is simulated.\n\nCuriously, the poster also shouts the words \"NEVER SURRENDER!\" across Trump's black-and-white mugshot from when Trump quite literally surrendered himself to law enforcement in Fulton County, Ga., on charges related to his alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.",

Cohen reportedly claimed he spoke to Trump during the brief phone call about an alleged payment to Stormy Daniels, but Blanche painted the picture that the call was actually about harassing phone calls Cohen had been receiving from a 14-year-old prankster.\n\nWATCH -- CNN's Cooper: I Would \"Absolutely\" Doubt Michael Cohen's Testimony If I Was a Juror:\n\nBlanche pointed to text messages from Cohen to Schiller about the harassing calls that bookended the phone call in question, as Breitbart News reported, citing Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press and Katelynn Richardson of the Daily Caller:\n\nPer Lee's tweets, the call came in between texts to Schiller from Cohen regarding the harassing calls. The first text was at 7:48 p.m., and the second was at 8:14 p.m. The Daily Caller's Katelynn Richardson reported from the courtroom that Schiller \"left a voicemail at 8:01\" and followed up \"text me\" at 8:02 p.m. The disgraced former attorney then called him at 8:02.\n\n\"You lied about this. You said you didn't remember the harassing phone calls -- now you claim that in the one minute and 36 seconds call you spoke about the harasser and Stormy Daniels,\" Blanche said, per Lee.\n\nOnce the prosecution concludes its closing arguments, deliberations will begin.

Someone who can be trusted and respected. Someone who understands the U.S. Constitution and respects the rule of law. Someone who can be a role model young people can look up to ... someone like John McCain or George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe leading candidate, Donald Trump, may lack some or all of those qualities.\n\nIowa will send 40 delegates to the July confab in Milwaukee. Twenty of them are pledged to support candidates who have dropped out of the race but are only bound to support them on the first ballot. Could some brave Republicans, perhaps Iowa Republicans, find a window of opportunity to look beyond Trump?\n\nAfter all, several state and federal grand juries have indicted him on a variety of charges.\n\n* In December 2022, a New York jury found two Trump companies guilty of 17 felonies related to tax evasion.\n\n* In March 2023, a New York grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal damaging information (known as the \"Stormy Daniels Hush Money Case\").\n\n* In May 2023, a federal grand jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a lawsuit filed by E. Jean Carroll and ordered him to pay her $5 million.\n\n* In January 2024, another federal jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll and ordered Trump to pay her another $83 million.\n\n* In February 2024, the judge in the civil fraud case ordered Trump to pay the state of New York $354 million plus interest. Judge Engoron: \"The frauds here leap off the page and shock the conscience.\"\n\n* In the Mar-a-Lago case, Trump is charged with 40 felony counts of mishandling of classified documents, obstructing justice, and making false statements. No trial date is set.\n\n* In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump and 18 allies for violating 12 Georgia statutes in 161 actions that attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election. No trial date is set, but several of the 19 have pleaded guilty.\n\n* In August 2023, Trump was indicted on felony charges for working to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the violent riot at the U.S. Capital on Jan. 6, 2021. No trial date is set.\n\n* And several of Trump's current or former allies including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Rudy Gulliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Alan Weisselberg, Sydney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, and Jenna Ellis have been found guilty, pled guilty, or been indicted on a variety of charges.\n\nThere is also the matter of Trump admitting that he would like to be dictator on \"day one,\" and openly admiring strongmen Xi of China, Erdogan of Turkey, and Putin of Russia.\n\nAnd, if any of the delegates have grandchildren, they may be concerned about Trump's pledge to reverse all Biden environmental actions and to not implement any new environmental protections.\n\nIs Donald Trump really the best presidential candidate the Republican Party can find?\n\nRalph Plagman served as a teacher and administrator for 49 years in the Cedar Rapids Community Schools.\n\nOpinion content represents the viewpoint of the author or The Gazette editorial board.

Betto Rodrigues / Shutterstock\n\nMuch ado has been made about the baubles and bibelot a cash-strapped Donald Trump keeps peddling to MAGA-heads.\n\nWhich is perhaps why Trump is increasingly offering prospective 2024 presidential campaign donors trinkets and honorifics with effectively no discernible value at all -- in exchange for a cash contribution.\n\nRaw Story has assembled a running list, as drawn from Trump's various fundraising emails and text messages during the past many months:\n\nGold card\n\nUpside: The \"NEVER SURRENDER 2024 GOLD LIMITED EDITION\" card sure is shiny. It's also made of \"METAL.\"\n\nDownside: You may be a fool if you believe that metal is really gold. You'll also get more mileage from any credit, debit, ATM or senior discount card found in your wallet.\n\nThe \"TRUMP 2024 BALLOT DEFENDER PLATINUM LEVEL METAL LIMITED EDITION\" is advertised to a \"TOP SUPPORTER\" who has earned Trump's \"PLATINUM RATING.\"\n\nThat Trump's campaign sent it to anyone subscribed to his email list, including journalists, should provide adequate evidence about its exclusiveness.\n\nJust like the gold card and the platinum card. Except it's black.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment.\n\nAmong the questions Raw Story asked Trump's team: What are the differences among these cards other than the color? Do donors receive a physical card in the mail upon making a donation or just a digital image they can print out at home? How long does it take for someone to receive a card if physical cards are offered? Is there a minimum amount one must donate to receive a card? Do the cards entitle the bearer to any benefits or perks, and if so, what?\n\nA \"2024 Trump Life Membership\" might seem like a pretty sweet deal. After all, this membership is being offered to you by a man who owns hotels and golf courses and luxury resorts.\n\nUnfortunately, the \"life membership\" comes with a 100 percent guarantee that if you enter Mar-a-Lago using this as your lone credential, your visit will be brief.\n\nIf diamonds are forever, why not just get a Trump life membership and save yourself some confusion?\n\nThis will signify your membership to what Trump is calling the \"Trump National Committee\" -- a joint fundraising arrangement between Trump's presidential campaign committee and the Republican National.\n\nExcited to support a self-styled \"day one\" dictator but aren't ready for a full-time gig?\n\nBuy your way onto the \"2024 Trump Advisory Board\" and become a \"trusted\" adviser to the man who wants to become our nation's 47th president.\n\nBut rest assured that if you do, the person who Trump is pictured talking to on the phone will not be you.\n\nA cool $35 will snag you this gig. No details whatsoever on what rights or responsibilities this will entail.\n\nMost of the members of Trump's presidential Cabinet aren't too jazzed about the former president again seeking the White House.\n\nEnter the \"OFFICIAL TRUMP CAMPAIGN CABINET.\"\n\nThis new Cabinet \"will be made up of my most ELITE, PATRIOTIC, and TRUSTED supporters that are up for the ULTIMATE challenge - providing my team and I with valuable insight and advice as we make some of the most important decisions leading up to the 2024 Presidential Election and BEYOND,\" Trump writes.\n\nWhat's the catch? Just donate \"ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY,\" and you, too, can start channeling your inner Wilbur Ross and begin taking lots of naps. (Trump might even say you're as \"dumb as a rock.\")\n\nOh, you think you're special because you're in the Official Trump Campaign Cabinet?\n\nTurns out that folks in the \"Official Trump 47 Club\" also get invited to be among the \"select few Patriots\" who Trump will \"rely on and will provide me with the insight and support to RECLAIM America.\"\n\nFor those who really love element No. 79 but need more than a card.\n\nFor those who really love element No. 78 but need more than a card.\n\n\"To be certain that we have a consistent stream of funds every single month, I'm asking you to become a Sustaining Member of our 2024 presidential campaign by making a monthly contribution of any amount ... even $1 or $5,\" Trump writes.\n\nThe membership does not appear to come with a public television-esque tote bag or John Tesh CD. (Sad!)\n\nSo what, exactly, does this particular membership, or any Trump these memberships, entitle one who is granted a membership?\n\nDo different memberships come with different benefits, if they come with any benefit at all?\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to Raw Story's several requests for comment.\n\nFor years now, Trump's campaign has been promising a \"select\" group of supporters that they would have their name etched on a \"wall\" in Trump's office.\n\nPerhaps forgetting that they've run this promotion before, or perhaps hoping that supporters themselves have forgotten this fact, Trump is again promising to \"build a beautiful wall at my office dedicated to a select group of donors who stepped up at this critical time.\"\n\nLike another wall -- say, one on the southern border -- it'd be reasonable to question why the Trump Donor Wall hasn't already been built.\n\nOne thing is for certain: Mexico can't pay for the Trump Donor Wall, because foreign campaign contributions are illegal, per federal election law.\n\nIf Trump seems to be putting the \"meh\" in memberships, he's got something way cooler -- ambassadorships!\n\nGet ready to channel your inner Benjamin Franklin, Anthony Wayne Jerome Phillips-Spencer or Spock when you \"secure your status as an Official 45 Ambassador before it's too late.\"\n\nNo, you will not have access to a State Department jet or even \"Trump Force One.\"\n\nSo, you've already got a Trump gold card. And you're also a Trump Gold Club member.\n\nBut like Trump himself, you really, really love gold.\n\n\"Golden Trump Patriots like you WILL BE THE REASON we take back our Country from the WORST, and most CORRUPT, President in HISTORY,\" Trump explains in offering this opportunity.\n\nGolden Trump Status may be achieved for the low, low pyrite-esque price of $20.24, according to a Trump campaign email.\n\nAmerica First Lifetime Achievement Award for Patriotism\n\nAmericans of a certain age may remember those grifty letters your parents would receive via U.S. mail informing them that their little Johnny or Katie had been named to the Who's Who of Upper Midwestern Left-Handed 7th Graders.\n\nJust send a check for $99 plus shipping and handling and the publisher would send back a book where your name -- misspelled, of course -- would appear in four-point font on page 743, printed on paper half a micron thick.\n\nThe America First Lifetime Achievement Award for Patriotism appears to work similarly.\n\nEven though the invitation states that Donald Trump Jr., the former president's own son, has nominated you for this \"MAGA Movement Honor,\" there's a catch.\n\n\"$35 -- DONATE THIS AMOUNT TO ACCEPT\" a black button with white letters informs you when you click to accept the award.\n\nOne day, you're watching a football game in your wood-paneled basement rec room, and you decide the vintage, autographed posters of Bernie Kosar and Cheryl Tiegs look a bit ... dated. Time for an upgrade.\n\nLucky for you, a modest campaign donation will snag you a \"signed poster from Donald J. Trump, the best President of all time!\"\n\nUnlucky for you, Trump's signature is simulated.\n\nCuriously, the poster also shouts the words \"NEVER SURRENDER!\" across Trump's black-and-white mugshot from when Trump quite literally surrendered himself to law enforcement in Fulton County, Ga., on charges related to his alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's lawyers were back in court in Manhattan Monday, trying to wrap up his defense in the hush money trial. But Trump appears to have his own ideas about how to defend himself.\n\nAs Trump's attorneys were doing their job, the former president took to his Truth Social account and -- much as he has done after trial arguments on several days -- fired off a series of quotes from various right-wing commentators attacking the trial and supporting his innocence.\n\nAmong those he quoted was right-wing National Review editor Andrew McCarthy, who said, \"Former FEC commissioner Bradley Smith's testimony would have established that Trump cannot have willfully violated FECA [The Federal Election Campaign Act]. Because NDAs are not campaign expenditures, Trump did not have a FECA legal duty with respect to them...Ergo, he could not have intentionally flouted a known legal duty.\"\n\nAlso in his list of quotes was right-leaning law professor Jonathan Turley, who said, \"A classic closing pitch by lawyers is to use a physical object like a three-legged stool.

He has pleaded not guilty. The former president has been charged in four criminal cases in total, making history as the first American president to be so indicted.\n\nHis significant legal fees have largely been bankrolled by his supporters as he has primarily used donations made to his political action committees to pay his lawyers.\n\nIn total, Trump has spent nearly $100 million in legal fees, almost all paid for by donations, since he first left office in 2021 and began attempting to fend off various investigations.\n\nThese legal fees have been piling up faster since he was indicted. Trump's Save America PAC has paid around $50 million in legal bills to various law firms representing him since his first indictment in March 2023, Forbes reported, citing Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nHis fundraising for his legal expenses falls within a gray area of campaign finance law due to loopholes and lax enforcement by the FEC.\n\nBut now, these funds could soon dry up. The accounts that Trump has been using to pay his lawyers had access to just $6.8 million at the end of March, according to campaign finance filings, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThis means that the former president will have to pay his own legal bills or find other ways to cover them.\n\nTrump has a net worth of around $7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nAlong with his lawyers' fees, a New York judge also handed Trump a $454 million civil fraud judgment in February.\n\nHe posted a $175 million bond in April after an appeals court granted his request to lower the bond, with his lawyers arguing that it was a \"practical impossibility\" to fulfill the original penalty.\n\nNewsweek reached out to a Trump campaign spokesperson for comment outside of regular working hours.\n\nThe hush money case is the first one of Trump's four cases to go to trial, and is now entering its final stretch with closing arguments beginning on Tuesday.\n\nThe other cases relate to alleged election interference in Georgia, a federal case relating to Trump's alleged attempts to subvert the results of the 2020 election, and the alleged mishandling of classified documents. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing, claiming he is the victim of a political witch hunt.\n\nAs Trump tries to stay on top of his legal fees, he has also been working to close the financial gap between his campaign and President Joe Biden's, as Biden's campaign committee has been significantly out-raising his.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The trial of former President Donald Trump is heading toward a conclusion. For those who at the beginning thought the case was weak and politically motivated, the presentation of the prosecution's evidence has made it seem even weaker and more politically motivated. A conviction will not change that.\n\nOn the other side, though, some in the anti-Trump world who were originally skeptical about the case's merits have come to believe that it is actually stronger than they first thought. That was not necessarily because the case is actually stronger but because, as events unfolded, it became clear that the current trial, in which Manhattan Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges that Trump committed bookkeeping offenses as part of a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 presidential election, represents Democrats' only chance to try Trump, possibly to convict him, and perhaps even to imprison him before the election in November.\n\n\"Not all that long ago, I thought that the trial currently being held ... seemed the least serious of the cases against him,\" wrote George Conway, the conservative lawyer-turned-Biden megadonor, in the Atlantic earlier this month. \"But I feel the need to admit error. The truth is, I've come around to the view that People v. Trump is, in at least some ways, the perfect case to put Trump in the dock for the first time, and -- I hope, but we'll see -- perhaps prison.\"\n\nWhy is that? Conway, one of the more aggressive members of the anti-Trump resistance, wrote that he now believes the Manhattan case perfectly exposed what he says are Trump's myriad lies. But for the resistance, the most salient fact about the Manhattan trial is this: It is happening. It is getting done before the election, which is the most important consideration for Democrats who pray that a Trump conviction could change the dynamics of a presidential race in which Trump leads President Joe Biden.\n\nThe other cases against Trump seem lost in legal never-never land. The resistance's favorite case, special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump over the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, is awaiting two critical Supreme Court rulings and seems unlikely to go to trial before the election. The second-favorite case, Smith's indictment over classified documents, is lost in procedural complexities. And the final indictment, the one that, like the current case, was brought by a local prosecutor, Fulton County Democratic District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, seems to be a total mess.\n\nBut the current case, brought by Bragg, who, incidentally, won office in deep-blue Manhattan on a promise to pursue Trump, is a reality. If you really want to bring down Trump, some anti-Trumpers believe, who cares if it is weak? Who cares if it is politically motivated? Trump is \"a criminal\" who \"basically tried to destroy American democracy,\" Conway said in an interview last week. \"And whatever they can get him for is fine with me.\"\n\nWhatever they can get him for is fine with me. That is perhaps the most succinct and direct explanation for the wave of Democratic lawfare we have seen in the run-up to the 2024 vote. The cases are all over the place, with four prosecutions in all, at the county level, the federal level, in New York, Washington, D.C., and Georgia. For more than a year, it has been obvious that they represent a redundant effort against Trump. If one case falters, another might succeed. And if one or two or three cases falter, the fourth might still break through.\n\nAnd that is what has happened in Manhattan. Just as some of the anti-Trump trial skeptics thought in the beginning, the end of testimony and the arrival of closing arguments have highlighted the flaws in the case. One analyst on CNN's pro-prosecution coverage said, \"The crime here is not easy to explain or understand.\" On MSNBC's even more pro-prosecution coverage, another analyst said, \"It is difficult because it's a very nuanced argument. ... It's never been prosecuted before.\" If charges are so byzantine that it is hard to convince reasonable people that a crime even occurred, then maybe Manhattan prosecutors should not have charged Trump with 34 felony counts that could result in a maximum of 136 years in prison over what is basically a bookkeeping matter. But such is the state of our justice system today.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If Trump is found guilty, where does that leave Republicans like me?", "body": "Will Republicans vote for Donald Trump even if he's found guilty?\n\nThis could be the quandary for Republicans if the former president is convicted in the hush money trial. It could raise important legal, ethical and political questions - or at least it should - about Trump's candidacy and our willingness to vote for him. A verdict could come this week after Tuesday's closing arguments.\n\nRepublicans' views of Trump have already shifted. A May PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll shows that 46% say Trump has acted unethically. This number has jumped 12 points since February. This is a hint that the trial has tarnished Trump's reputation in the eyes of Republicans. But to what extent?\n\nIf Trump is found guilty, MAGA Republicans will reframe this as a win, suggesting this bolsters their original conspiracy theories about the left's use of lawfare as a way to prevent Trump from winning again. They will nod their MAGA-capped heads and say in unison: See? We told you so! It was all a giant conspiracy!\n\nHowever, if Trump is found guilty, conservatives who are not pro-Trump or hard-right MAGA fans (like myself) will face the hardest question of all. Who will conservatives who, like me, dislike Trump and President Joe Biden vote for? Will we vote at all?\n\nTrump is the best we have? Trump is ruining the GOP with his lawlessness. Republicans like me deserve better.\n\nA guilty verdict could push Republicans like me into a corner to reckon with our conscience. Do we choose someone who acts unethically and illegally but is a \"conservative\" because even that is better than a Democrat?\n\nAs of now, I don't think I could justify voting for Biden.\n\nBiden has derailed this country's social fabric with executive decisions like revising Title IX and offering billions in student loan forgiveness.\n\nThanks to his \"Build Back Better\" plan, inflation is still higher than it was a few years ago, and his administration has already pledged to increase taxes on wealthy people and corporations.\n\nOne could argue that optics are the least important thing about a president, but perception matters when you're the leader of the free world. Biden's incompetence, incoherence and weakness fail to communicate the right message to allies and enemies around the world.\n\nFor many Republicans, this is enough to withhold their vote. For single-issue voters, like many evangelicals, Biden's pro-abortion stance is enough not to vote for him regardless of how they feel about Trump.\n\nGreat job, Biden! Social Security is going broke and debt payments are breaking the bank.\n\nBut some conservatives do have reservations about Trump and what it means if we support him in November.\n\nShould a Republican choose Biden - someone we know is not a conservative and who we believe is actively derailing the country's economy, reputation and social fabric - just to avoid Trump?\n\nFor some Republicans, this answer is easy: Never vote Democrat. Ever. For the rest of us conservatives, Trump is so awful for the GOP and for democracy - he's just so loathsome and narcissistic - that with or without a guilty verdict, we will struggle to vote for him. This raises questions about the importance of idealizing party over country.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley answered that question when she announced Wednesday that she would vote for Trump, even though she previously said he's \"not qualified\" to lead the nation. This is a position one would expect Haley, as a known Republican leader, to take.\n\nMany, many Republican leaders will vote for Trump even if they think he's not qualified, even if the jury does find him guilty, because they are casting their vote, in their minds, against Biden rather than for Trump.\n\nRepublicans in this precarious position must weigh whether or not a guilty verdict in a hush money trial is as bad as a president who we believe incoherent and unethical.\n\nDo Republicans think that, if elected, Trump will be a worse president than Biden? This is tricky to answer and depends on your worldview and values, and what you think a president is responsible for doing.\n\nTrump lies, obfuscates and constantly changes his story. He maintains the image as a Republican for the people when really he's an elitist charming fraud who is deceitful, immoral and lacks principles.\n\nUnlike 2016, we now have a clearer picture of Trump. Conservatives know there are clearly two versions of him in the White House. One that champions religious liberty, tries to grow the economy with tax cuts and appoints originalist justices to the Supreme Court. Another apparently pays off lovers, lies about classified documents and maintains that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIt was one thing for Trump to have a decent presidency, but another for him to maintain that the last presidential election was rigged and support the riot that ensued at the nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was one thing to claim the election was stolen but another to test that with lawsuits in a handful of states and be proven wrong over and over.\n\nA vote for Trump is an acknowledgment that we condone this. Do we? Is it OK to vote for this because we don't like higher taxes? Do we let him maintain the election was rigged against all evidence to the contrary because we don't like a massive, costly student loan forgiveness plan?\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

If, as a Republican, I think Biden is awful, and I do, how could I possibly think Trump is better? He's clearly not. But still, I can't vote for Biden.\n\nDemocrats and MAGA won't face this ethical decision. Their minds are made up. But a sect of conservatives - large enough to matter - will wrestle with this.\n\nA guilty verdict will make things harder for us.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

The Trump trial and 2016 election truthers", "body": "Former President Donald Trump and some Republicans famously rejected the results of the 2020 election. Trump called the election rigged. He encouraged the Jan. 6 protest at the Capitol that turned into a riot. And he and his supporters filed dozens of lawsuits to challenge Joe Biden's narrow victories in some key states.\n\nTrump lost them all; in the end, his legal effort to change the 2020 result was a resounding failure.\n\nBut Trump's work was amateur hour compared to the lawfare practiced by Democrats seeking to undermine the results of the 2016 election, the one that made Donald Trump president of the United States. What is perhaps most remarkable is that eight years later, it's still going on.\n\nThe leading edge of 2016 denialism was, of course, the Russia investigation, which Trump calls the Russia hoax. Turbocharged by the Hillary Clinton/DNC-financed Steele dossier -- which was an actual hoax -- the widespread political and media clamor for a criminal investigation of Trump overwhelmed the first months of his presidency and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017. Mueller's search for Trump-Russia \"collusion\" ended two years later when Mueller admitted he could not establish that any conspiracy or coordination ever happened. Although a number of figures around Trump were charged with unrelated or process crimes, Mueller never charged Trump or anyone associated with him with scheming with Russia to fix the 2016 election.\n\nAfter all the hysteria, speculation, media talk, and dark accusations, \"collusion\" was ... nothing. Nevertheless, collusion die-hards still maintain that Trump conspired with Russia and that Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 election might have tipped the vote to Trump ove Clinton. One of those die-hards is Hillary Clinton herself, who in 2019 said, \"You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.\"\n\nAll that might seem like ancient history except for The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.\n\nLast year, Alvin Bragg, the elected Democratic district attorney of Manhattan -- he was elected on a platform that included going after Trump -- filed 34 felony counts against the former president, all based on allegedly false bookkeeping. Normally, those charges, even if warranted, are a misdemeanor, and these were long past the statute of limitations. But Bragg found a way to turn them into felonies.\n\nWhat Bragg did was to charge Trump with falsifying business records \"with intent to commit another crime.\"\n\nThe problem was, Bragg did not specify that other crime, although his prosecutors gave the judge \"theories\" about what they called Trump's 2016 \"election interference.\" By the time of opening statements last month, prosecutors still had not settled on a specific secondary crime, but they had developed a full-blown conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. And it's not some sort of narrative that critics characterize as a conspiracy theory -- it's a real conspiracy theory.\n\n\"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,\" prosecutor Michael Colangelo said at the beginning of the prosecution's opening statement. (You may know Colangelo's name because he is the high-ranking Biden Justice Department official who joined Bragg's team for the purpose of prosecuting Trump.) Colangelo continued: \"The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 election; then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.\"\n\nColangelo went on to weave a tale in which Trump, then-National Enquirer chief David Pecker and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen \"formed a conspiracy ... to influence the presidential election by concealing negative information about Mr. Trump in order to help him get elected.\"\n\n\"You had three parts of this conspiracy,\" Colangelo told the jury. \"You had the agreement to run positive coverage; you had the agreement to attack his opponents; and then the core of the conspiracy was David Pecker's agreement to act as the eyes and ears for the campaign in an effort to locate damaging information about the defendant and then take steps to try to bury it to help Trump get elected.\"\n\nReading this, you might notice one thing about this conspiracy: Nothing that Colangelo described was illegal. Maybe it was shady, maybe it was ethically challenged, but it was not illegal. And yet Trump is now facing 34 felony charges and a maximum sentence of 136 years in prison. This Democratic conspiracy theory has turned into something very, very serious.\n\n\"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" Colangelo said. And then he added something heard from conspiracy enthusiasts everywhere: \"We will never know, and it doesn't matter, if this conspiracy was the difference-maker in a close election.\" That of course, implies that it might have been the difference-maker, thereby surely warming the hearts of Clinton and her dead-ender followers everywhere.\n\nIt's worth noting that for all Colangelo's talk, Trump is not charged with conspiracy. He is not charged with corrupting the election, whatever that might mean. As the former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote:\n\n\"In point of fact, there is no such information-suppression conspiracy crime in the law, and the indictment against Trump does not charge a conspiracy.\" And yet that phantom accusation is the basis for elevating Trump's alleged misdemeanors into a charge that could imprison him for the rest of his life.\n\nIn casual conversations recently, it has become clear that some Republicans have had a difficult time wrapping their head around what Bragg and Colangelo are doing. A 2016 election conspiracy? Didn't that sort of thing end with Mueller? How could Democrats focus so feverishly on Trump's 2020 election denial while doing some of the same stuff themselves, only on the much more serious level of trying to send Trump to prison? It might be hard to believe, but it is happening.\n\nThis content originally appeared on the Washington Examiner at washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3007902/trump-trial-and-2016-election-truthers/.",

Some favorites get personal praise: Byron York is \"a great person, great reporter.\" Alan Dershowitz is similarly \"a great person,\" Trump said. Occasionally, someone from CNN slips in. MSNBC gets the silent treatment.\n\nFor television, New York's ban on cameras in the courtroom means plenty of airtime for legal analysts. It evokes the high point of the form three decades ago when the O.J. Simpson murder trial made household names of the likes of Jeffrey Toobin, Nancy Grace and Greta Van Susteren. Fox's Jarrett, who worked at Court TV in the 1990s, straddles the eras.\n\nNaturally, it's not hard to find those who contradict Trump. On the television news networks covering the trial extensively, prevailing opinions tend to reflect the audiences they seek: little sympathy for the prosecution's case on Fox, equally difficult to find praise for the defense on MSNBC. On CNN, it's more mixed.\n\nThe more experienced legal minds -- like Chuck Rosenberg speaking on MSNBC on Wednesday -- note that it would be foolish to predict an outcome. The only opinions that really matter are the jurors'.\n\nMore nuanced coverage can usually be found offscreen. Sunday's edition of The New York Times, for example, had a news story quoting experts that concluded: \"Several experts say the case remains the prosecution's to lose.\" In the same day's opinion section, columnist Ross Douthat concluded that the case has been a political winner for Trump so far.\n\n\"Just as even paranoid people can have enemies, even sinful demagogues can face a politically motivated prosecution -- and stand to gain from the appearance of legal persecution,\" Douthat wrote. \"And that appearance, so far, has been the trial's political gift to Donald Trump.\"\n\nMSNBC was devoting a large part of its day to Trump's legal issues well before the current trial. Former prosecutor Andrew Weissmann is a huge presence there; he also contributes a podcast, \"Prosecuting Donald Trump,\" with fellow analyst Mary McCord.\n\nEven MSNBC's biggest stars, including Rachel Maddow, have spent time in the courtroom. After listening to Trump's defense earlier this week, she reported that it was \"discursive, sprawling and uninteresting.\"\n\nFox's commentators on this case have drawn much of Trump's attention. Turley made 47 appearances to talk about the trial on Fox's weekday programs from the start of the trial through May 15, with McCarthy logging 35, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters.\n\nMcCarthy once prosecuted terrorism cases in the U.S. attorney's office in New York's Southern District and represented Rudolph Giuliani. Turley is a professor at George Washington University's law school and founded the Project for Older Prisoners, which helps seek the release of geriatric prison inmates.\n\nWriting about the trial in the National Review, McCarthy said that \"Trump ought to be acquitted for the simplest of reasons: Prosecutors can't prove their case.\" He criticized prosecution witness and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen on the air, saying Cohen's dishonesty and bias against Trump will be problems he has to overcome with the jury.\n\nTurley, speaking to Fox's Jesse Watters last week, called Cohen \"the most compromised, unbelievable witness in the history of the federal legal system.\" On another Fox appearance, Turley said the judge, Juan Merchan, shouldn't even give the case to the jury.\n\n\"I think this case is gone,\" Turley said. \"They didn't state the basis for a crime.\"\n\nTrump began leaning more on the conservative commentators after Merchan deemed him in violation of a gag order that bars him from criticizing prosecutors, court staff and witnesses. He sometimes stops himself from reading passages, citing the order.\n\nTrump's legal team at one point asked if they could submit articles to the judge to pre-approve before Trump posted them on his Truth Social site. Merchan refused.\n\nOn Fox this week, anchor Martha MacCallum said, \"If you watch the legal experts on the other channels, this case is airtight.\"\n\nThe network on Monday, as it usually does, ran Trump's daily wrap in its 5 p.m. ET hour -- the time slot of \"The Five,\" the most popular program on cable news. MSNBC didn't carry Trump. CNN showed the former president and immediately followed him with a fact-check.\n\nAs happened that day, and occasionally others, Trump singled out some CNN commentators for praise. He quoted CNN's Laura Coates, Elie Honig and Tim Parlatore -- the latter a former Trump lawyer hired as an analyst.\n\nCNN's fact-checker, Tom Foreman, said that Trump was doing \"a lot of cherry-picking\" in his citations.", "source": {"uri": "brooklyneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brooklyn Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_abruzzese@brooklyneagle.com", "name": "Rob Abruzzese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Grace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_York", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Dershowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greta Van Susteren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Toobin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Toobin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.

It's even more so when it is based factually on \"a lie, a fiction.\" Alito's \"suggestion otherwise is an absolute treachery to confidence in democracy\" especially coming from a Supreme Court Justice who would \"be hearing cases involving an offshoot of this very set of beliefs and social turmoil.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Stop the Steal 2.0 -- or the continuation of Stop the Steal 1.0 -- is alive and well. And should Trump lose the presidential election in 2024, the Trumpian revolution will continue to thwart American democracy as Republican leaders have already told us they will only accept the election as legitimate if Trump wins.\n\nLike all of Trump's biggest lies and attacks on democracy and the rule of law, they are being financed and \"promoted by rich and powerful conservative groups that are determined to win at all costs.\"\n\nAll of this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is occurring amidst the new propaganda wars being waged globally by autocratic nations against constitutional democracies, their rules of law, transparencies, and accountabilities. Once again in 2024, like in 2020 and 2016, this war of narratives is being driven by Russian disinformation and by colluding members of the Trump campaign.\n\nIn addition, assistance this time around is also coming from an even more sycophantic GOP than in 2020 and a Supreme Court that has already weighed in in favor of the insurrectionist-in-chief and presumed Republican nominee.\n\nAs Anne Applebaum has written so incisively about the new propaganda war in the June issue of The Atlantic magazine, \"Autocrats in China, Russia, and elsewhere are now making common ground with MAGA Republicans to discredit liberalism and freedom around the world.\"\n\nALSO READ: 8 ways Trump doesn't become president\n\nHaving abandoned the Constitution and the rule of law, and having sanctioned that Trump and his ilk are, indeed, above the law, the Supreme Court has irresponsibly left the verdict of the former president's insurrectionary lawlessness not to a jury of his peers where it belongs -- Trump faces 88 felony counts across four criminal trials -- but to a voting body politic where the ultimate decision made will have little to do with either the facts or the law.\n\nWorse yet, in April, a New York Times/Siena College survey taken from 1,000 voters across the country found that when asked about the one thing voters remember about Trump's presidency, \"only 5 percent of respondents referred to Jan. 6, and only 4 percent to Covid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on the 2024 campaign trail in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Trump has been falsely claiming to Republican officials and supporters alike that he won states which were not even close in 2020.\n\nThese are not only lies, but they are part of his \"campaign strategy.\" For when Trump loses in Minnesota as Republicans have done consecutively since 1976, he will call it another \"rigged\" vote counting. It is not at all surprising that the corrupt Republicans are not calling Trump out on these lies. But neither are the Democrats who are merely regarding it as another example of Trump the fraudster being himself.\n\nLast and not least of all, Trump and his campaign earlier in the week tried to fundraise off of the false claims that Biden authorized the assassination of the former president during one of the searches for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago by the FBI.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I have reduced the 2024 elections to five questions that I believe people should ask themselves and need to answer before casting their votes this fall:\n\nI will now explain why the stuff or substance of the first four questions are subject to whether we become an illiberal democracy or an autocracy, remain a liberal democracy, or become a multicultural democracy.\n\nAt least in the short run, the election will decide whether the United States will remain a democratic and constitutional republic as we have known for 250 years. If it does not, it will become an illiberal democracy or an autocracy as in a \"new\" fascist America.\n\nAs Thomas Zimmer from Democracy Americana has revealed in his May 22 substack on the \"fascism debates\" and Donald Trump, American fascist: The former president \"has a fascistic way of describing the problem\" as a \"country in decline. It is threatened by outsiders - immigrants, invaders who are 'poisoning the blood'.\" The nation is also \"threatened by the enemy within: Un-American forces of radical leftism and globalist elites.\"\n\nTrump offers a fascistic solution: To MAGA the nation has to be purified from without and the enemies from within purged. Trump has \"repeatedly promised to round up and deport 15 million people - a deportation operation of unprecedented scale, explicitly targeting non-white immigrants.\"\n\nMore explicitly: Should Biden and the Democrats prevail, will the U.S. remain a tyranny of a minority -- a representative or democratic kind of tyranny -- with its rule of law and constitutional balance of powers striving to call the shots? Or will our government, should Trump and the Republicans win out, become a tyranny of an authoritarian oligarchy?\n\nIf Biden is returned to the Oval Office - and despite the enduring Trumpian revolution -- then the electorate or the people will have a third option other than a tyranny of a minority or a tyranny of an autocracy. This refers to a yet-unrealized struggle to build a new tyranny: one that's fully democratic - with direct rather than indirect representation of, by, and for people - a multicultural, if not a multiparty, majority to replace our antiquated, dysfunctional and polarized tyranny of a minority.\n\nIf voters return Trump to the White House, then the third option will be off the table until the American people rise up against the illiberal democracy -- and who knows, if and when, or how long that would take -- to overturn the reactionary and repressive tyranny of the autocracy.\n\nBecause the Founding Fathers were concerned about their envisioned democratic republic collapsing, they contemplated the descent of ancient democracies and republics into oligarchies and empires.\n\nThey knew -- as Aristotle had warned -- that inequality brings instability. And as Plato believed, demagogues by exploiting free speech may very well install themselves as tyrants.\n\nAccordingly, the authors of the Constitution sought a document to avoid what the ancient philosophers referred to as tyranny or the usurpation of power by one individual or group or faction or party.\n\nTo hopefully avert their birth of a democratic nation from coming to its own demise and going the way of the ancient democracies, our founders came up with a political architecture whose encroachment of power they hoped would be protected by a system of checks and balances and the rule of law.\n\nSimilarly, during the Constitutional Convention the founders were determined to prevent what James Madison called \"the tyranny of the majority.\" So they opted for a \"tyranny of a minority\" constructing a democratic republic exemplified by the establishment of a bicameral congress and an Electoral College as a means of not selecting our president through a direct, one person one vote, majority-take-all.\n\nIn addition to the unresolved democratic issues of inequality and instability or of demagogues exploiting free speech, societies both democratic and autocratic have been dealing with the unresolved issues of globalization since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nResponding to globalization, modern democracies after World War I and World II came and went in Europe and elsewhere as they dissolved into authoritarian or fascist dictatorships.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, democracies materialized in Eastern Europe, and within a relatively short period of time, several of those countries reverted back to authoritarianism, such as Hungary and Russia.\n\nToday, there are also the fascist, communist and authoritarian legacies of the rule by disciplined party elites with monopolies over reason or objective truth.\n\nThese elites all call the shots on behalf of the people. Undeterred by the interests of the people, domestic or global, they are always working against democratic rule and on behalf of authoritarian rule. In other words, against the interests of the vast majority of the people and on behalf of the interests of the oligarchical few and their minions.\n\nALSO READ: 'She's a joke': Meet Marjorie Taylor Greene's election enemies\n\nSince Trump began colluding with the Russians before the 2016 presidential election and took the sides of other illiberal democracies or dictatorships during and after his administration, he has also succeeded in capturing the entire GOP. Another Trump presidency would bring our system of checks and balances, rule of law and even the Supreme Court to the end, so to speak, of their constitutional ropes.\n\nIn sum, should Trump and his minions and all of their corruption and lawlessness triumph in the fall, then the United States will have crossed over -- temporarily, at best -- to the other side and joined forces with our heretofore anti-democratic opponents or enemies with their abundance of human repression and lack of individual freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, should Biden and his democratic defenders of law and order, liberty and justice score a victory over Trump this fall, then the American people will have the opportunity - as difficult as it will be - to fix the things that are wrong with our current democracy such as the Electoral College or the Supreme Court. And to deliver a legally reformed and more fully inclusive democratic republic.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Honig said that even he is struggling to get a grasp on the case, particularly the \"unlawful means\" Trump used to \"influence\" the 2016 election. (RELATED: Trump's Attorney Made Swiss Cheese Out Of Michael Cohen's Testimony, Raising Questions Of Perjury)\n\n\"Just so people can follow along at home, 'cause the crime here is not easy to explain and understand,\" Honig said. \"It's basically a three-step here for the prosecution, which is not great, but they can still do it. First of all, falsifying a business record under New York state law, that in itself is a misdemeanor. If it's done to commit some other crime, it jumps up to a felony. The some other crime here is New York state election law, which says you cannot try to influence an election by unlawful means.\"\n\n\"Now you're thinking, well, what are those unlawful means?\" he continued. \"That takes us to step three, where the prosecution has offered up three unlawful means ... that would be a federal campaign finance law, stay with me, a tax fraud, which I don't understand, I'm interested to see how they explain the tax crime. And then, get this, falsification of business records. So that one also is tough for me to understand. Falsifying business records in order to falsify business, right?

Blanche dubbed Cohen the \"MVP\" of liars and \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt,\" according to multiple reports.\n\nCohen was the sole witness to directly link Trump to the charges at the heart of Bragg's case.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump.\n\nIn fact, there is an entire site called Republican Voters Against Trump, full of testimonials from people who are supposedly Republicans about just how abhorrent they find the 45th president to be. Their grievances against Trump could have easily been compiled by an editor in the New York Times newsroom, or perhaps by a staff writer for Rachel Maddow.\n\nTrump wants to \"terminate the Constitution,\" a voter named Kim from South Carolina claims.\n\n\"It's all about Donald Trump, It's not about America,\" Emet from Maryland says.\n\nJanuary 6th \"was an insurrection\" and Trump was responsible for it, says another voter named Chuck from Nebraska.\n\n\"Trump would absolutely 100 percent sign a federal abortion ban,\" Jessica from Ohio claims.\n\nTrump \"is a threat to the United States,\" says a voter named Ed from Texas.\n\n\"I see a president that's gonna cause a civil war,\" Stephen from South Carolina says.\n\n\"I don't think that the man has the moral character required to function in the Oval Office,\" says a voter named Hank from Tennessee.\n\nThe list goes on with similar delusional testimonials warning about supposed Trump threats -- should he return to the White House.\n\nI'm not going to dignify each of these with a response, but here is a brief defense that should alleviate some of these imagined concerns -- all of which are media myths.\n\nNumber one: Trump never said he wanted to \"terminate the Constitution.\" He rightfully said that the 2020 election was not conducted fairly, and he questioned whether the Constitution would allow a new election to occur due to the high number of irregularities that were uncovered.\n\nAnd for the record, Al Gore challenged the 2000 presidential election, and Hillary Clinton maintains that the 2016 election was stolen by an \"illegitimate president.\"\n\nNumber two: Trump did not cause an insurrection. He held a massive rally for his supporters, who wondered how a man who barely campaigned and does not appear to be well-liked by anyone could somehow defeat an incumbent president who won 18 of 19 bellwether counties and became the first incumbent president in 100 years to increase his vote total from the previous election and still \"lose.\" He told them to \"peacefully and patriotically\" head over to the Capitol Building so they could watch Congress have a debate about election laws that were violated or changed at the 11th hour to benefit the Democrats.\n\nNumber three: Trump has stated very clearly that he would not sign any federal abortion legislation and that the matter should be left up to the states.\n\nNow, allow me to enlighten these poor lost souls, as well as others who have been living under a rock for the past three and a half years and may have forgotten just how good things were during the Trump years.\n\nUnder Trump, the prices of gas and groceries were affordable and inflation was under control.\n\nMiddle-class family income increased by nearly $6,000 -- more than five times greater than the Obama/Biden administration.\n\nUnder Trump, we were energy dominant; the labor force participation rate reached its highest number on record at 160 million, and jobless claims hit their lowest level in half a century.\n\nAfrican-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded -- the unemployment rate for women was at a 65-year low -- and wages grew at their fastest rate in a decade.\n\nUnder Trump, the border was secure, our military was rebuilt, our national defense spending increased, and our enemies knew not to mess with us.\n\nUnder Trump, there was relative peace in the Middle East. Israel was not fighting for its survival, and Saudi Arabia was on the verge of becoming one of its allies.\n\nUnder Trump, there was no war in Ukraine -- just a made-up story about Vladimir Putin and Russian collusion -- and then another made-up story about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a quid pro quo that never occurred.\n\nUnder Trump, there was a sense of pride, passion, and love for our country. Sure, Hollywood elites, the leftist corporate media, and campus crazies made a lot of noise and empty threats and masqueraded in pink pussy cat hats -- but that's all it was. Go ahead, move to Canada. See how much we care.\n\nAmerica is for patriots -- not communists and socialists!\n\nBut whatever goodwill and positive sentiments were built up during the Trump presidency have quickly evaporated under Joe Biden.\n\nGas and groceries have become unaffordable. Thanks to Biden's disastrous Green New Deal policies, our strategic petroleum reserve is depleted. Inflation is through the roof, reaching as high as 9 percent. Mortgage rates are skyrocketing.\n\nOur porous border is nonexistent. Terrorists and criminals can seemingly walk right in with everything short of the red carpet rolled out for them. Hotels that were built for tourists are now homes for illegal migrants. Nursing students are slaughtered by violent men who have no right to be in this country.\n\nWe have a president who can barely walk or speak, and a vice president who's just as helpless.\n\nWe have a corrupt Justice Department, in tandem with radical Democrat prosecutors who want to throw the former president in jail for imagined crimes that will never be tried again in a court of law.\n\nWe have an administration that embraces DEI at every turn, and the result, not surprisingly, is the dumbing down of standards in virtually every industry.\n\nMerit, unique skill sets, and expertise are considered antiquated and irrelevant -- checking off all the right boxes is all that matters now.\n\nThe world is in chaos. Our foreign policy is weak, ineffective, and influenced by professional leftist agitators and ignorant campus freaks, whose only talent involves leaving college quads full of trash and filth -- and shrieking historically illiterate slogans that call for wiping Israel off the map.\n\nAnd while all of this is happening, the man you say is \"decent,\" says not a peep, and does nothing to bring the American hostages home. Instead, he worries about his flailing support with young voters and the black community, so he goes and gives uninspiring race-baiting commencement addresses at historically black colleges to try to win back their support.\n\nThere is no denying that under Trump, America was stronger, safer, wealthier, and more prosperous. But by voting against his personality and not against his policies, you're not only voting against your wallet; you're voting against every single hard-working American whose life has now become unaffordable under Bidenomics.\n\nIs your hatred for one man really worth shrinking your bank account? Is it worth letting our country become overrun with illegal migrants? Is it worth hurting small business owners and factory workers who cannot afford a tax increase?\n\nTo all those who wished that the Republican nominee for president was Governor Ron DeSantis, or God forbid, Nikki Haley, who finally came out and endorsed Trump -- their time may come again soon.\n\nBut this is Trump's time right now. And if you really want to help the country, then do the right thing and rally your friends and family around the only candidate who has the best shot at reversing this sorry state of affairs our country currently finds itself in.\n\nNo one is asking you to love Trump or join the MAGA movement, although you're certainly welcome. We're just asking you to put your petty grievances aside for one day and to support the guy who loves this country in favor of the other guy who is destroying it -- along with his enablers.\n\nStop worrying about what your colleagues, associates, friends, and family will think of you, and start worrying about how to save this great country that we love.\n\nIt's time for the Republican Party to unite behind Trump.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_keltz@amgreatness.com", "name": "David Keltz", "type":

But I have come up with yet another one of what I feel should be a basic rule of life: Be true to your word. The impetus, again, is questionable behavior by Republicans, one a politician, one a judge.\n\nI realize that trusting the words of a politician is a fool's choice, but Nikki Haley has managed to lower the bar even further for acceptable if smarmy hypocrisy with her pronouncement that she will vote for Donald Trump for president.\n\nHaley waged an aggressive primary campaign against Trump for their party's presidential nomination and, while not succeeding, had respectable results. She found there are indeed some Republicans who are not happy with Trump.\n\nAmong the arguments she made for voting for her and not Trump: \"Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he's been and will continue to be for our party. They're just too afraid to say it out loud.\"\n\nShe accused Trump of being \"confused,\" \"unhinged,\" \"not qualified\" and \"too old\" to be president.\n\nSo OK, even with her past history of flip-flops (serving as Trump's UN ambassador and then resigning after two years, saying she would not run against him for president and then running against him for president), those are pretty strong and accurate comments she made about Trump. So why does she now say she is voting for him?\n\nAmbition. Political ambition, pure and simple. She can vote for whomever she wants in private, but in public she still wants some of Trump's followers in the party to remember her four years from now when she'll want to run for president again.\n\nShe's willing to sacrifice any personal integrity she might have to preserve that hope for the future, even though she knows full well that a Trump second term in office could change the country's political landscape drastically.\n\n(Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who also challenged Trump unsuccessfully in the primaries, is hedging a similar bet. He tried to out-Trump Trump in the primaries, but learned that no one could do that.

It's still unclear.", "body": "Support independent journalism in Ukraine. Join us in this fight.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump has remained largely silent about foreign policy lately. Amid his hush-money trial in New York City, he has focused on attacking campus protesters over the war in Gaza, criticizing U.S. President Joe Biden, and attempting to undermine court proceedings.\n\nAs the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump has barely mentioned Ukraine or articulated any policy positions regarding the country or Russia's war against it.\n\nWith less than six months away from the U.S. presidential election, Trump's vague past remarks on foreign policy, his public admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the varied views within and outside the GOP are shaping the discourse in his absence.\n\nDespite posting frequently on his social media network Truth Social, he has mentioned Ukraine only a few times in recent months.\n\n\"We should never give money anymore without the hope of a payback, or without 'strings' attached,\" one of Trump's Truth Social posts read in February. Another from April said, \"As everyone agrees, Ukrainian Survival and Strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it is also important to us! GET MOVING EUROPE!\"\n\nTrump's calls for Europe to provide more aid and his repetition of the claim that Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine had he been in office are among his few public comments on the issue.\n\nExperts on the topic, like Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, are critical of Trump's claims.\n\n\"He talks about 'they haven't paid their money to NATO,' he doesn't understand it's not about paying money to NATO, it's a commitment to devote 2% of your GDP to defense spending,\" Pifer said.\n\n\"That's someone who doesn't understand the American national security interest in having a stable and secure trans-Atlantic region.\"\n\nLast month, as the U.S. Congress passed $61 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine, Trump's strategic ambiguity, at least, was loud and clear. He softened his opposition to aid in April, aiming to avoid public backlash as his trial for falsifying business records began. He publicly supported U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson as he navigated the aid package's passage.\n\nJohnson did, however, include a provision, supported by Trump and many Republicans, directing the president to seek repayment of $10 billion in economic assistance starting in 2026.\n\nTrump's insistence on a loan reflects a sentiment among the MAGA right, influenced by Russian propaganda, that the war is an easily solvable border dispute.\n\nWithout specifics, Trump has repeatedly claimed that he can resolve Russia's war in Ukraine before Inauguration Day. Privately, he has said he would pressure Ukraine to cede territory to Moscow, including Crimea and the Donbas, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\"I will say certain things to each one of them that I wouldn't say to the rest of the world, and that's why I can't tell you much more than that,\" Trump said in a March interview with former aide Sebastian Gorka, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin.\n\nAt a rally in New Jersey this May, Trump mentioned Ukraine in the context of claiming that the Palestinian militant group Hamas wouldn't have attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, nor would Russia have invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, if he had been president.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but Trump repeated the same remarks at a rally in New York City this May.\n\nTrump has voiced in public his admiration of autocratic leaders like Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Despite this, many Americans fail to grasp the dangers a second Trump presidency could pose, according to Jacob Heilbrunn, author of the new book, \"America Last: The Right's Century-Long Romance with Foreign Dictators.\"\n\n\"It's not a pretty picture,\" Heilbrunn told the Kyiv Independent, noting the false belief that Trump fits into traditional presidential molds.\n\nHeilbrunn predicts Trump will immediately abandon Ukraine, while others suggest his presidency could exacerbate the conflict in other ways.\n\nMichael Kimmage, a Cold War historian who held the Russia/Ukraine portfolio for the State Department during the Obama Administration, posits two scenarios: the war could continue as before, or the United States could become more deeply involved.\" Kimmage himself believes Trump might escalate the war to distinguish himself from his predecessors or to strengthen his case for holding negotiations.\n\nCurrently, the void left by Trump's limited comments on Ukraine has been filled by conservative voices: Former CIA Director and Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently criticized Biden administration restrictions on Kyiv using U.S.-supplied weapons on targets in Russia. He also told the BBC that the U.S. hasn't provided Ukraine with the resources needed to win the war.\n\nAnd in a recent New York Times essay, \"What Trump Could Do in Foreign Policy Might Surprise the World,\" Curt Mills, executive editor of The American Conservative, repeated themes of Trump being a skilled negotiator and that his return to the White House \"could offer surprising opportunities for peace.\"\n\n\"Who is going to be in front of Trump is what actually matters,\" Mills said, who spoke with the Kyiv Independent about the team forming around Trump and the impact they might have on policy toward Ukraine in a presumptive Trump 2.0 administration.\n\nPifer, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, emphasized the concerns over a possible U.S. withdrawal from NATO, given Trump's experience in staffing decisions in his first term, and the loyalists he is likely to bring into a second term.\n\nWhile a recent NYT/Sienna College poll indicates that Ukraine is not a top issue for U.S. voters in crucial swing states, and the more than a dozen Republicans who voted to pass the $61 billion aid package faced no backlash in their subsequent primaries, foreign leaders and conservative politicians continue to visit Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, convinced they can influence his thinking on Ukraine.\n\nOrban, after visiting in March, said Trump wouldn't \"give a penny\" to Ukraine, while former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said he's tried to convince Trump that aiding Ukraine is in U.S. interests.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-affiliated America First Policy Institute (AFPI) recently published a national security book advocating that any future U.S. aid to Kyiv be contingent on Ukrainian participation in peace talks with Russia. One of AFPI's chairpersons is Robert Lighthizer, Trump's former trade ambassador and a current policy adviser.\n\nAs U.S. cable networks no longer air Trump's speeches, speculation on how Trump feels about Ukraine is growing, and current GOP leaders are speaking up.\n\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican of Kentucky, told ABC News in April that Trump's silent support for Speaker Johnson was crucial for passing the aid package, potentially swaying part of the Republican party towards a more engaged global stance and away from Trump's isolationism.\n\nHowever, A CBS News poll that surveyed U.S. voters found that among Republicans, Trump remains the most trusted source for information on Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nRepublicans who trust Trump are also unlikely to support further aid to Ukraine, according to the poll.\n\nIf his voters put their trust in him to inform them on the war in Ukraine, some also put their faith in him to end it.\n\nOne Trump supporter at his rally in New York City this May, Drew, a 25-year-old who requested only his first name be shared, said he believes Trump's priority is to end the war immediately.\n\n\"I think he can do it, I think he has good negotiation skills and has prior experience with Putin and Zelensky.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [],

Instead, he got Tiffany.\n\nA Special Message From PoliticusUSA\n\nIf you are in a position to donate purely to help us keep the doors open on PoliticusUSA during what is a critical election year, please do so here.\u00c2", "source": {"uri": "politicususa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICUSUSA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_easley@politicususa.com", "name": "Jason Easley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family Resources", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tiffany-Trump-Donald-Trump.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 102, "relevance": 1}

The blink of an eye ago she called him \"unstable and unhinged,\" an individual who's \"just toxic\" and \"lacks moral clarity.\"\n\nShe follows the same beaten path of Marco Rubio, who became a big fan of the man he'd labeled a \"dangerous\" \"con artist\"; Ted Cruz, now an enthusiastic backer of a person he called a \"sniveling coward\"; and Lindsey Graham, now a leading apologist for the man he'd branded a \"race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.\" In the political class, there are dozens upon dozens of other such examples amid rare exceptions like Mitt Romney.\n\nRepublicans who run for office speak the obvious truth about Donald Trump until they realize he's got them beat and, if they want to win more elections in a party where Trump and Trumpism remain dominant, they have no choice but to turn obsequious and pretend that they never had a brain or a conscience. Trump proceeds to treat all these former rivals like something grosser than gum stuck to the bottom of his shoe, and that's appropriate, because the rivals-turned-sycophants disrespect themselves.\n\nWhen politicians so brazenly change their tune on such matters, it's little wonder the public treats them with contempt; that contempt, ironically, is one of the things that in 2015 fueled the rise of a supposedly more authentic personality named Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republicans far more worth our attention these days are those who were up close and personal with Trump in his first term, who saw the way he operated as president, and who now warn at the top of their lungs against him becoming president again.\n\nThere's former Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump tried to turn into an accomplice in his plot to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nFormer Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, who emerged from the cauldron of the White House calling Trump \"a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators\" who \"has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.\"\n\nThere's Bill Barr, once Trump's attorney general, who calls Trump \"a consummate narcissist\" who \"constantly engages in reckless conduct.\" There's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who called Trump a \"wannabe dictator.\"\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who calls Trump a \"threat to democracy\" based on his attempt to send as many as 250,000 troops to the U.S. Mexico border -- as well as his apparent interest in launching missile strikes on Mexico. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who called Trump the \"first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try.\" That's an unmistakably consistent pattern from those who saw him play commander-in-chief.\n\nNone of these people are seeking political office. All of them align with Trump on many key policy questions. All of them know that being honest about Donald Trump will make it harder for them to thrive professionally in a Republican Party where Trump has overwhelmingly positive approval ratings. Yet none can deny seeing what they saw: an immature, craven, self-serving, out-of-his depth individual who abused the power of the presidency for four years -- then tried to steal a second four-year term -- and is salivating at the opportunity to do it again.", "source": {"uri": "dailycamera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boulder Daily Camera"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

For the first time in American history, a former president was facing criminal charges. In the months that followed, three more indictments came down. Conventional wisdom suggested that this would be more than enough to sink Trump's chances of reprising his role as commander-in-chief.\n\nIt's clear now that the Bragg indictment was, in fact, a turning point. But as Trump's trial in New York City winds down, it's equally as obvious that the conventional wisdom was wrong.\n\nIf Trump retakes the White House this fall, it will be in no small part thanks to his legal opponents, not in spite of them.\n\nWhile the former president's effortless romp through the Republican presidential primary has given observers the impression that his victory in it was inevitable, this is a false memory and product of hindsight. By early 2023, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had come within 15 points of closing the national polling gap between himself and Trump, even opening up leads in Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Michigan according to some statewide surveys. He did all this, mind you, without so much as declaring his candidacy for the office.\n\nAlas, the Bragg indictment changed everything. Within a month of it dropping, Trump's lead over DeSantis had doubled in size. The most viable challenger to the de facto incumbent had his knees cut out from under him before his campaign had even begun.\n\nAnd while the instant rally-around-the-leader effect in the GOP electorate could have been predicted, the progressive establishment's excesses in prosecuting Trump have, improbably enough, turned his legal battles into a political asset to him in the general election as well.\n\nOf the four sets of charges leveled against Trump, the first is the weakest by far. Alvin Bragg's attempt to raise his political profile and earn a spot in the history books is an affront to the legal profession and the rule of law. It's obvious that his zombified corpse of a case reanimating minor charges after the expiration of the statute of limitations would not be brought against any other American, especially if the prosecution's argument hinged on the word of a horrifying wretch like Michael Cohen.\n\nThe trial itself - in all of its boring, inane, weedy detail - has helped make this truth plain to the average American. Moreover, the media's ceaseless, gleeful 24/7 coverage of it has compounded the damage. For the past several weeks, CNN has been running a new program called \"Trump Hush Money Trial\" from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon when the court is in session. Last Monday evening it followed that up with hours of specials on the trial and a dramatic reading of the transcript of Cohen's back-and-forth with the prosecutors holding his leash.\n\nThis unseemly spectacle has betrayed the fact that it is personal disdain for Trump that is the driving force behind this case and raised questions over whether similar motivations are fueling the other, more meritorious criminal cases against the presumptive Republican nominee. By blotting out the sun with allegations against Trump and chatter about them, Democrats and their allies in the Fourth Estate have numbed voters to some of his very real sins. If everything Trump does is to be treated as criminal, in effect nothing is.\n\nTrump's character flaws have long been baked into any electoral contest in which he competes. His trial in New York hasn't revealed anything new about him, but it has demonstrated that all of the furrowed brows and self-righteous monologues over the threat he represented to America's political norms were little more than a convenient pretense for attacking him. While attempting to take full advantage of the moral high ground they believed they would enjoy in the 2024 election, Democrats have actually managed to cede some of it back to Donald Trump. Imagine that.\n\nIn the process they've not only come across as vindictive, but out of touch. The country has deep misgivings about Joe Biden's exacerbation of post-pandemic inflation and empowerment of America's enemies across the globe. He is the least popular incumbent president to seek reelection in the last 70 years. Instead of making the case for Biden on policy grounds - admittedly a tall task - progressives have spent the last year spiking the football over Trump's legal troubles.\n\nIf Biden was a strong candidate highly regarded by the American people, a single, slam-dunk case against Trump might have been the final nail in the former president's political coffin. But in light of Biden's failures, the avalanche of criminal allegations leveled against his opponent is reflecting poorly on him.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If it happens again this fall - and all polls indicate that's very possible - Trump's grievance will only grow deeper.\n\nFor if there's one thing he wants more than almost anything else - except remaining rich and powerful - it's to win the popular vote, which would supply a mandate for his agenda, just spelled out in a remarkable pair of springtime interviews with Time Magazine.\n\nTrump said he would not hesitate to use the military to round up and deport any immigrants here illegally, even if they are really legitimate. This would apparently violate the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prohibiting use of the military against civilians, but Trump said undocumented immigrants are not civilians, and chances are judges he appointed will uphold whatever he does.\n\nTrump also threatened police departments that fail to cooperate in any such military operation: He said he would deprive them of all federal funding, even if those funds have been specifically appropriated by Congress in an act that he himself might have signed.\n\nIn his earlier war on California, Trump tried just that tactic against police departments that carried out sanctuary city laws passed by city councils or county boards.\n\nThis was just one type of action in Trump's \"war,\" which was largely thwarted by Xavier Becerra, then the state's attorney general and now the federal secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nBecerra also fought for years to keep the 1970 federal Clean Air Act's California waiver in effect despite Trump's determined effort to cancel it. The waiver lets California impose stricter smog standards on cars and other polluters than federal ones.\n\nTrump also tried to cancel virtually all federal clean air and water rules, even when industries involved wanted to keep them going. His moves were quickly reversed when President Biden replaced him, but Trump has said he would immediately resume that effort if elected again.\n\nThen there's abortion. Trump told Time he would not oppose Republican-run states tracking pregnant women and preventing them from seeking abortions. This would include the many now coming here from states like Idaho and Arizona, where abortion is severely restricted.\n\nCount on Gov. Gavin Newsom and current state Attorney General Rob Bonta to try preventing such abortion tracking from extending to California, and to work at reversing any attempts to restrict travel by pregnant women.\n\nTrump also promised to extend the wall that already reaches across parts of California's border with Mexico. Only Congress could prevent this, but it never stopped such efforts when Trump was previously President.\n\nCalifornia's growing legal marijuana industry could also expect some sort of reversal of Biden's recent loosening federal rules on medicinal use of pot. It's anybody's guess whether Trump would send federal agents or the military to shut down the many marijuana shops now operating in California.\n\nPlus, Trump was consistently slow to grant disaster designations for areas ruined by wildfires, depriving homeowners and others for months of federal benefits that have come quickly under Biden. Trump blamed California for those fires, claiming the state failed to clean up forest floors that burned. He never acknowledged that most such areas are on federally-owned land not under state control.\n\nNo one knows all the areas a resumed Trump war on California might affect, but it's a safe bet these would be some.

It will be held on November 05, 2024 and the winner will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. With Republicans putting up a strong front, let us take a look at what happens if Donald Trump wins the United States presidential election in 2024.\n\nMass Deportation\n\nWith the issue of migrants taking centerstage, some aggressive policies are expected if Trump wins in 2024. Trump has talked about deporting around 11 million undocumented immigrants. There are also plans to build migrant detention camps across border areas. Stricter border control measures will be taken. There are plans to use the U.S. military for deporting migrants, if required.\n\nAbortion rights\n\nWhile Trump is unlikely to order a federal ban on abortion, he will favor policies that allow states to make their own abortion rules. As such, state-level regulations for abortion could get preference if Trump wins in 2024.\n\nWithdrawal from NATO\n\nTrump has often talked about the high cost associated with NATO. If Trump wins in 2024, the USA could withdraw from NATO. Security arrangements with other countries such as Japan and South Korea may also be withdrawn. Such moves will be part of Trump's 'America First' approach.\n\nReturn to fossil fuels\n\nTrump had earlier described climate change as a myth. But later, he had also called it a serious subject. If Trump wins in 2024, use of fossil fuels may increase. This will impact climate change efforts. Environment policies could be pushed to the back burner.\n\nA polarized world\n\nIf Trump wins in 2024, a high level of polarization may occur within the country. The election and electoral system in the United States may come under greater scrutiny. The polarization within the United States will eventually spread to the entire planet. We are already seeing conflicts in various parts of the world.\n\nExpansion of border wall\n\nTo control illegal immigration, Trump had always supported the building of the border wall. If Trump wins in 2024, the southern border wall project will gain momentum. Funding for this project is likely to be prioritized.\n\nHealthcare and Obamacare\n\nTrump has often criticized the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This federal law was signed with the goal to provide easy access to health insurance for US citizens. In his second term, Trump may attempt to replace the Act with a new one or introduce the required changes.\n\nGun rights\n\nTrump has always been a strong supporter of gun rights. As such, he may not allow any gun control measures to be implemented. This will be in support of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects the rights of people to keep and bear arms.\n\nSupreme Court appointments\n\nIf Trump wins in 2024, he is likely to push additional conservative Supreme Court appointments. This will impact legal decisions in the United States for several decades.\n\nAs is evident, dramatic policy shifts are expected if Trump wins in 2024. However, there could be challenges in the implementation stage. Moreover, domestic and international equations are forever evolving. Such factors will continue to influence US policy decisions.", "source": {"uri": "newspatrolling.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.newspatrolling.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Someone who has been a prosecutor as long as you should know. It's hard for me to imagine how that was accidental in any way.\"\n\nBefore he concluded, Todd Blanche asked that the jurors not send his client to prison. Now, with the jury excused, Joshua Steinglass, the prosecutor who will give his side's closing argument, stands up and objects. \"That was a blatant and wholly inappropriate effort to call sympathy for their client,\" Steinglass says, asking for a curative instruction.\n\nThen Haberman wrote:\n\nJustice Merchan is now excoriating Todd Blanche for making an \"outrageous\" statement. Merchan is clearly furious, and reminds Blanche, and not for the first time, that he was a prosecutor for long enough to know that it was out of bounds.\n\nBromwich followed up with more from Merchan:\n\n\"Making a comment like that is highly inappropriate,\" the judge said. \"It is simply not allowed, period.

What a crappy contractor this was.\"\n\nEven though both Trump and Biden endured humiliating gaffes, they have each tried to portray as evidence of the other's senility.\n\nThe ages and abilities of these men have been questioned during the election cycle.\n\nA shock poll released in early 2024 found that 60% of Americans do not feel that Trump and Biden have the mental capacity to serve as president.\n\nIn early May, Trump was mocked on X for stating that his 18-year-old son, Barron Trump, was 17 years old. Barron turned 18 on March 20.\n\nTrump made this mistake on May 9 when he was asked during an interview with Miami's Telemundo 51, NBC's Spanish-language network, about his son entering politics now that the Florida GOP chose him as an at-large delegate for the state at the Republic National Convention in July.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to Trump's error, saying that \"NBC News has lost its mind and clearly suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\nCheung also mentioned that \"instead of focusing on President Trump's second-term agenda and undoing Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous policies, NBC has chosen to engage in tabloid journalism fit for the checkout aisle of a grocery store.\"\n\nDuring the Minnesota Republican Party's Lincoln-Reagan Dinner, Trump demanded Biden take a drug test before their first debate, arguing that the president had been \"high as a kite\" during the State of the Union address.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Donald Trump Joe Biden Political News", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alessio_atria@uinterview.com", "name": "Alessio Atria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_use_by_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media use by Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-large", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At-large"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemundo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telemundo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trump2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-20", "textStart": 1306, "textEnd": 1314}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1344, "textEnd": 1349}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

We hope you had a good one! Today we're talking about:\n\nDonald Trump is winning over donors in Silicon Valley.\n\nLong considered a hotbed of liberal dollars, the valley is undergoing a cultural shift as tech elites fret over issues such as free speech, technology regulation and taxes. Some are growing critical of Joe Biden and are considering backing Trump instead, if they haven't already done so [free to read].\n\nNext week, tech investors David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, co-hosts of the popular All-In podcast, are holding a dinner in San Francisco that will cost at least $50,000 per person. For the VIP experience featuring \"preferred seating\" and a photo with Trump, guests must cough up $300,000.\n\nPalmer Luckey, who founded defence company Anduril and Oculus VR, is also planning an event for Trump in Newport Beach, California.\n\nIn 2020, there were about 2.8 Biden donors for every Trump donor in Silicon Valley, with a ratio of 3.9 to 1 in the wider Bay Area, according to an FT analysis. So far in 2024, there are 2.6 Biden donors for every Trump donor, while the Bay Area ratio has dropped to 3.3 to 1.\n\nPalantir executive Jacob Helberg gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Biden's 2020 campaign, but recently gave $1mn to Trump, citing the ex-president's border policies and his pro-Israel and anti-China stances.\n\nHelberg told the FT:\n\nWhen people like Palmer [Luckey], myself or David Sacks are openly out in support of Trump, we're not facing the same kinds of reactions and backlash that we would have eight years ago.\n\nThe biggest Silicon Valley get would be Elon Musk, and pro-Trump tech leaders are trying to get him to endorse the Republican.\n\nOver on Wall Street, Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman endorsed Trump, in the latest sign of Trump's former critics coalescing around him. The private equity billionaire's announcement could lead to more Wall Street money flowing into Trump's coffers.\n\nIf you think Donald Trump should return to the White House, the FT would like to hear more. Please take our survey.\n\nDespite the growing enthusiasm for Trump among deep-pocketed donors, fixed-income investor Bill Gross thinks a second White House stint for the Republican would disrupt the bond market more than a Biden win.\n\nGross, who co-founded Pimco and is known as the \"bond king\" of Wall Street, told the FT's Brooke Masters that Trump would increase the US deficit.\n\n\"Trump is the more bearish of the candidates simply because his programmes advocate continued tax cuts and more expensive things,\" he said. \"Trump's election would be more disruptive.\"\n\nWith Biden struggling to get credit for a booming economy while Americans are weighed down financially by high prices, Trump has made his economic plans a central pillar of his campaign. But Gross's comments undercut Trump's argument that he would be a better steward of the US economy and financial markets than Biden.\n\nThe ex-president has pledged to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent, which the Committee for a Responsible Budget thank-tank projects would cost $4tn over the next 10 years.\n\nRecent polling suggests that support for Trump among Black voters could hit 20 per cent this election cycle, almost double what it was in 2020. Hitting that number would be the best Republican performance among this group since 1964.\n\nHistorically, Black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic party -- and still have more confidence in Biden than Trump overall -- but Biden appears to be in danger of losing some of these critical backers.\n\nLate last week, Trump held a rally in the Crotona Park neighbourhood of the Bronx to try to woo some Black and Latino voters, telling them that their interests were being superseded by an influx of migrants into the city.\n\nBoth groups were being \"slaughtered\", Trump said. \"They're losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose.\"\n\nSome rally attendees who voted for Democrats in the past feel left behind, and have lost confidence in the party to make things better.\n\n\"The Bronx is getting horrible now,\" Kevin Seecharan, a Trinidadian immigrant who has lived in the borough for 30 years, told the FT's Joshua Chaffin. He said Crotona Park was deteriorating and he had no faith in Democrats to reverse its fortunes.\n\nAnd the way retired city worker Margarita Rosario sees it, \"there's no money for veterans, and now we've got all this money for immigrants\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David O.

It's standard operating procedure when the FBI executes (no pun intended) a search warrant.\n\nAppearing on Deadline White House with Nicolle Wallace on Thursday, former FBI official Frank Figliuzzi explained that it is required because acting on a search warrant can be dangerous, so it's best to expect the unexpected to prevent any violence. He posted on X, \"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nTrump has so conditioned his base and now even others that the government is out to get him with \"witch-hunt\" trials. He repeats over and over again that all these trials and charges are \"election interference\" by Joe Biden in order to smear Trump and prevent him from campaigning.\n\nIn an analysis in this week's New York Timesshowed that Trump's pattern of sowing election doubt has intensified, and his repeated use of \"rigged\" election has reached a fever pitch, which means he is succeeding in undermining the November election.\n\nWhen you layer this up -- a rigged election, witch-hunt trials, and an assassination attempt -- you have a very dark undercurrent brewing about what lies ahead in the campaign.\n\nIt is hard to see or tell how Trump can add to an assassination attempt. It frightens me what might lie ahead in his ruthless scheme to win the election. Russian interference looks like child's play at this point.\n\nI'll leave this open for all. It's a very dangerous game, and when you start talking assassination, the stakes could be deadly.\n\nChristopher Wiggins: I read this article by Juliette Kayyem, with whom I spoke a few times to help me understand the concept of stochastic terrorism. In a piece called \"Trump's Assassination Fantasy Has a Darker Purpose,\" she wrote in The Atlantic about how Trump frames the situation to normalize violence among his supporters. Kayyem writes, \"Trump and his fans have gone from simply damning the 'deep state,' the loose term for anyone in national security or law enforcement who hinders his autocratic aims, to portraying federal agents as assassins.\"\n\nI was recently in the Supreme Court for Trump's attorney's oral arguments claiming he has immunity from prosecution. During that hearing, Trump's lawyer made the astonishing claim that a president could legally have somebody assassinated if it were considered part of his official duties. This just proves that what Trump is screaming foul about is something he believes he would have the right to do. And that should keep everybody up at night.\n\nWhat Trump is doing feels like a basket of tactics in which stochastic terrorism resides. His lies about witch-hunt trials, a rigged election, and an assassination attempt provide a dangerous undercurrent to the upcoming election. Considering what he might claim next in his ruthless scheme to win is frightening. His narrative not only endangers the democratic process but also encourages his supporters to view violence as a legitimate political tool. The implications are chilling, and the stakes are incredibly high as we move closer to the election.\n\nKayyem concludes, \"Since the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump has become more and more apocalyptic in his language. This week, he sent another dangerous signal to his supporters: FBI agents are an armed enemy, ready to assassinate the former president. Unless, of course, Trump and his mob get to them first.\"\n\nShe's right.\n\nJC: Yes, she is right, and it's shocking that we are talking about a presidential candidate claiming the other one is out to assassinate him. Can you imagine Bob Dole, George W. Bush, John McCain, or Mitt Romney saying something like that? Trump has disintegrated morality and civility to the point where people are immune to these wild accusations. Voters are just shrugging their shoulders and saying. \"Oh, Trump, he'll say anything.\" How did we get to this point?\n\nTrudy Ring: It's very sad that we've gotten to the point that we say, \"Oh, it's just Trump being Trump.\" And of course, his base will believe anything he says. I don't know quite how people got to the point of shrugging their shoulders at his vile rhetoric -- I know none of us are at that point! The thing to do is mobilize reasonable people to get to the polls and vote for Biden.\n\nTalk to anyone you know who's undecided, although it's hard to believe anyone is, and also anyone who's tempted to vote for a minor-party candidate. Biden hasn't done everything right, but he's done a LOT of things right, and the alternative is kissing our democracy goodbye. By the way, there's a great column in The Washington Post by Dana Milbank reminding us all just how horrid the orange monster is. Share it far and wide!\n\nJC: Trudy, you raise a good point. Perhaps it's up to folks like Milbank - and us - to keep the heat on. To keep calling Trump out. To do all we can to raise awareness. There was an article in this weekend's New York Times about the problem the Biden campaign is having trying to bring Trump into focus for voters. How do you go about doing that when the list of Trump's lies, bad attributes and barbaric and illegal behavior are a mile long?\n\nI worked on campaigns; I don't have the right -- or any -- answer for that question. Moreso, I get asked all the time by friends who live in Europe, \"What's going on over there?\" And I don't have an answer to that either.

Nixon, like Trump, believed America was in bad shape. In 1968, crime, the war in Vietnam and the murders of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy had shocked and depressed the country. The Democratic National Convention would follow the GOP convention at the end of August. It featured riots in the streets that shocked voters watching on TV. Many argued those riots helped Nixon win the presidency. Some of those issues, especially crime and social unrest, prevail today. Nixon was a national figure longer than Donald Trump, but Nixon was seen as dour, uncomfortable around others, and possessing a personality that conveyed awkwardness and insincerity.\n\nThe \"New Nixon\" no longer scowled, his hair had grown longer (possibly a nod to the hippie era) and he smiled more than in that sweaty 1960 debate with John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn his Miami acceptance speech, Nixon alternated between what the Times called \"genuine grace notes and darker rumblings ... alternately bright and horrific.\"\n\nTrump is like that.\n\nIn the first scheduled debate with President Biden June 27, Trump should consider presenting a \"New Trump.\" Critics might say that's like asking a leopard to change its spots and Trump is unable to overcome his narcissistic personality.\n\nIf he can, how might it work? Trump should stop referring to Biden as a \"crook.\" Stick to the issues people care about - the open border and what is happening as a result, inflation (he can compare prices when he was president and now), wars, school choice, defunding universities that tolerated antisemitic demonstrations on their campuses, revising the tax code to make it fairer and flatter so everyone has skin in the game, and how the $34 trillion national debt cannot be sustained.\n\nOn this last point, Trump is vulnerable because he added $8.4 trillion to the debt. Trump should promise to create a bipartisan commission that would recommend to Congress ways to reduce the debt. Yes, that would include reforming Social Security and Medicare to keep it from going broke, which every honest person knows must be done.\n\nBiden has only a few policy achievements, so he will be left to engage in personal attacks about the \"threat to democracy\" posed by Trump. If Trump occasionally displays soft answers, he can duck Biden's punches and confuse the often confused president. Recall Ronald Reagan's line to President Jimmy Carter during their Oct. 28, 1980 debate: \"There you go again.\"\n\nTrump had some good lines in his speech to residents of The Bronx last week. He spoke of reducing crime, cleaning up subways, lowering taxes, and creating more jobs, but without details about how some of those promises would be paid for, or fulfilled. If ever the phrase \"we can't go on like this\" meant anything, it means everything today.\n\nAbsent a religious or other transformation, I'm not sure Trump can reinvent himself in time to make a difference, if at all. He seems comfortable as the \"old Trump.\" The political landscape changes quickly and might change even faster after the results of Trump's current and upcoming trials are known. Like Reagan, Trump is experienced in television and that medium allows for new looks, even if they are not genuine. That's the purpose of makeup.\n\nThe \"New Nixon\" turned out to be a cover for the old and real Nixon. Can Trump transform himself into a \"new Trump\" and mean it, or just fake it? Either way, he could upset the political dynamic and expectations between now, the debates and the election.\n\n========", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Reston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Reston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

In every one, the losing candidates accepted the results as lawful, with one exception: Donald Trump.\n\nThe losing candidates have been nearly equally divided by political party: Thomas E. Dewey (R), 1948; Adlai Stevenson(D), 1952 and 1956; Richard M. Nixon (R), 1960; Barry Goldwater (R), 1964; Hubert Humphrey (D), 1968; George McGovern (D), 1972; Gerald Ford (R), 1976; Jimmy Carter (D), 1980; Walter F. Mondale (D), 1984; Michael Dukakis (D), 1988; George H.W. Bush (R), 1992; Bob Dole (R), 1996; Al Gore (D), 2000; John F. Kerry (D), 2004; John McCain (R), 2008; Mitt Romney (R), 2012; Hillary Clinton (D), 2016; and Donald Trump (R), 2020.\n\nNixon lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy by a razor-thin margin, and stories circulated at the time about vote theft in some states. Nixon accepted the results. Just as in 2000, when Gore accepted the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn a ruling by Florida's Supreme Court and halt a recount in the state, thus giving Florida's 25 electoral votes -- and the presidency -- to George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2020, Trump, contending that major fraud had been committed during the election, formally challenged the results -- as was his right. But Trump went beyond the law: For more than two months after Election Day, he spread the lie that he had won when it was obvious to any fair-minded person that his claims were false.He still repeats this falsehood.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with having conspired to retain power and overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election by unleashing attacks on Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, that would obstruct the \"process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election.\"\n\nIt's hard to predict when or whether Smith will get to try his case. But we do have an answer to the question of whether Trump has had any success in convincing the American electorate that he won. Over one-third of U.S. adults said in December they believe Joe Biden was not legitimately elected president. Score that as a partial Trump victory.\n\nTrump's campaign of pervasive lying succeeded in eroding public confidence in an election in which there was no evidence of significant fraud.\n\nNow Trump has embarked on a no-holds-barred attempt to regain the White House -- a post he desperately needs to quash federal criminal charges against him, both in the election conspiracy case and in a second prosecution related to his handling of classified information. But he's back on the campaign trail backed by nearly 70 percent of Republicans who are convinced Biden should not have entered the White House in the first place.\n\nWould that were the end of it.\n\nTrump is laying the groundwork for a repeat of the 2020 post-election debacle. He has managed to get a swath of the country to believe that Biden can't be re-elected without cheating. It follows, at least in the minds of Trump and his supporters, that if he doesn't win in November, the election would have been unfair and its result -- Biden's re-election -- illegitimate.\n\nAnd then what? On Jan. 6, 2021, thousands stormed the Capitol because Trump convinced them the election had been stolen. They smashed through doors and windows and disrupted the House and Senate chambers to \"Stop the Steal\" and obstruct Congress from exercising its constitutional responsibility to certify electoral votes. They failed, thanks to D.C. police and U.S. Capitol officers who put their lives on the line.\n\nBut next time?\n\nNone of this is open to speculation. Trump's false claims that he lost because of fraud did prompt his followers to assault the seat of American democracy.\n\nIf he does it again, will they do it again?\n\nLittle wonder two-thirds of Americans fear violence could follow this year's elections should Trump once again lose to Biden.\n\nBut that's no reason to lose heart and quake in your boots. Threats of violence are more reason for Americans to stand up straight, march to the polls and perform that bedrock duty of a democracy: vote, as has been done in 19 presidential elections during my lifetime.\n\nShould that happen, and if many millions of voters show their faith in ballot box and vote for candidates who uphold the core values of liberty, equality and democracy, then Donald Trump may well be handed his greatest defeat of all.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1960 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adlai Stevenson II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Dewey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas E.

The program was terminated by President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in the White House. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, pledging more humane and orderly immigration policies, but has struggled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nTrump also would reinstate the COVID-19-era Title 42 policy, which allowed U.S. border authorities to quickly expel migrants back to Mexico without the chance to claim asylum, he told Time magazine in an interview.\n\nHe would use record border crossings and trafficking of fentanyl and children as reasons for the emergency moves, Time reported, citing comments from advisers.\n\nTrump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls \"catch and release.\"\n\nTrump focused on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected. His administration built 450 miles (725 km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,145-km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures.\n\nTrump would introduce a border security and immigration bill as one of the first pieces of legislation, Time reported.\n\nMASS DEPORTATIONS\n\nTrump has pledged to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, focusing on criminals but aiming to send millions back to their home countries.\n\nTrump told Time he did not rule out building new migrant detention camps but \"there wouldn't be that much of a need for them\" because migrants would be rapidly removed.\n\nTrump would rely on the National Guard, if needed, to arrest and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally, he said. When questioned, he also said he would be willing to consider using federal troops if necessary, a step likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\nTrump has also vowed to take aggressive new steps to deport immigrants with criminal records and suspected gang members by using the little-known 1789 Alien Enemies Act.\n\nStephen Miller, the architect of Trump's first-term immigration agenda, said in an interview last year with a right-wing podcast that National Guard troops from cooperative states could potentially be deployed to what he characterized as \"unfriendly\" states to assist with deportations, which could trigger legal battles.\n\nTRAVEL BANS Trump has said he would implement travel bans on people from certain countries or with certain ideologies, expanding on a policy upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump previewed some parts of the world that could be subjected to a renewed travel ban in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and \"anywhere else that threatens our security.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Trump focused on the conflict in Gaza, saying he would bar the entry of immigrants who support the Islamist militant group Hamas and send deportation officers to pro-Hamas protests.\n\nTrump said last June he would seek to block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the United States.\n\nLEGAL IMMIGRATION Trump said last year that he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to immigrants living in the country illegally, an idea he flirted with as president. Such an action would run against the long-running interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would likely trigger legal challenges. During his first term, Trump greatly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and has criticized Biden's decision to increase admissions. He would again suspend the resettlement program if reelected, the New York Times reported in November 2023. Trump has said he would push for a \"a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.\" In his first term, he took steps to tighten access to some visa programs, including a suspension of many work visas during the COVID pandemic.\n\nTrump has vowed to end Biden \"parole\" programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants with U.S. sponsors to enter the U.S. and obtain work permits, including Ukrainians and Afghans. He has called Biden's programs an \"outrageous abuse of parole authority.\"\n\nHe would seek to roll back Temporary Protected Status designations, the New York Times reported, targeting another humanitarian program that offers deportation relief and work permits to hundreds of thousands. Trump tried to phase out most Temporary Protected Status enrollment during his first term, but was slowed by legal challenges. A federal appeals court in September 2020 allowed him to proceed with the wind-down, but Biden reversed that and expanded the program after taking office.\n\nFAMILY SEPARATION\n\nIn a town hall with CNN last year, Trump declined to rule out resuming his contentious \"zero tolerance\" policy that led thousands of migrant children and parents to be separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018. He defended the separations again in November, telling Spanish-language news outlet Univision that \"it stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.\" While Trump has refused to rule out reinstating a family separation policy, key allies who could potentially join a second-term administration are wary, Reuters reported. The Biden administration last October announced a settlement agreement with separated families that would offer them temporary legal status and other benefits while barring similar separations for at least eight years.\n\nDACA\n\nTrump tried to end a program that grants deportation relief and work permits to \"Dreamer\" immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, but the termination was rebuffed by the Supreme Court in June 2020. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the Trump administration said it would not accept any new applications to the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, and would explore whether it could again attempt to end it.\n\nTrump plans to try to end DACA if elected, the New York Times reported.

There's also dramatic orchestral backing.\n\n\"From midnight tweets, drinking bleach, to tear-gassing citizens and staging a photo op, we knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\" De Niro says. \"Then he lost the 2020 election -- and snapped.\"\n\nThe word \"SNAPPED\" snaps on screen.\n\nDe Niro continues: \"Trump has snapped. He's desperately trying to hold on to power. Now he's running again, threatening to be a dictator.\"\n\nTrump is shown at an auto rally from last weekend in Ohio, saying \"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath.\"\n\nTrump has already slammed the ad on Truth Social, claiming the bloodbath comment was said in the context of talking about China's auto exports and the economy.\n\nBut threatening violence if he doesn't get elected is one of his stump staples.\n\n\"Trump wants revenge, and he'll stop at nothing to get it,\" De Niro says at the end.\n\nBy the time we hear \"I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message\" in the President's upbeat voice, the change is jarring. We've just been in Armageddon.\n\nSome Dems are ecstatic that Biden is finally fighting fire with fire, attacking Trump in the same way the former real estate developer brutally attacks and belittles others.\n\nThough I am a Biden voter who lives in a liberal bubble, I disagree with the strategy of this ad.\n\nIt may rattle the former president personally, but throwing his own inflammatory language back at Trump only helps Trump.\n\nIt bolsters his persecution complex, which forms the backbone of his MAGA followers, because they feel persecuted, too. It's a picnic for grievance.\n\nA casual viewer might even mistake it for a Trump ad. It's filled with chaos, noise and Trump speaking to crowds, which is exactly what the Trump campaign is all about.\n\nThe ad might be catnip to Trump haters, yes, but it's still preaching to the converted. The MAGA community would only salute it.\n\nYou can't speak truth to glower. They are an unmovable force, so dug in with him and the lies and projection they have long accepted as truth that changing their minds would be akin to losing their religion.\n\nTo get his campaign on-track, Biden needs to talk about Biden. It's painful that he's the subject of so much disinformation. Half the population believes we are in a recession, that the stock market is down, and that unemployment is at an all-time high -- and, oh yeah, that Biden failed to pass a border bill.\n\nThat was actually the work of the Republicans, who were ordered to stop the bill, on the theory that the border issue was an election winner for he who started the club of gathering in long red ties and ill-fitting blue suits.\n\nBut the steady drumbeat of Biden leaning on his record, talking about infrastructure, high employment, being one of the world's top economies, returning women's bodily autonomy, successfully lowering drug prices, etc. will eventually get to some of the \"double haters,\" voters who are up for grabs since they dislike both Trump and Biden.\n\nNext will be the debate on June 27-- if it happens. Trump has already said he wants to drug-test Joe, because he will be \"high as a kite.\" That's sheer projection.\n\nBiden staff advisor Jen O'Malley Dillon has said the presidential campaign is \"continuing to crystallize for voters.\"\n\nShe said they'd focus on three key issues before the debate: abortion, democracy and economic fairness.\n\nCommunicating Biden's message effectively will be tough, because people are attracted to the capacious Trump underbelly.\n\nBut winning over undecided voters might come down to the accretion of so many Trump misdoings in real life that they can no longer be denied. His armor comes from his shamelessness.\n\nPerhaps eventually his Bannon-supported desire to be a dictator will go so awry, so opposite to the democratic ethos that is America, that the fence sitters might finally snap.", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MediaPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barbara_lippert@mediapost.com", "name": "Barbara Lippert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bleach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_op", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo op"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All caps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2024/05/24/screenshot-2024-05-24-at-94214-pm_yf9x8uw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 3515, "textEnd": 3522}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 92, "relevance": 1}

Plans include reinstating the 'remain in Mexico' program, mass deportations, travel bans, and ending certain legal protections. His proposed measures aim to tighten border security and prioritize American labor and values.\n\nRepublican former U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration if elected to a second four-year term in the White House on Nov. 5. Here are some of the policies under consideration:\n\nBORDER ENFORCEMENT Trump has said he would restore his 2019 \"remain in Mexico\" program, which forced non-Mexican asylum-seekers attempting to enter the United States at the southern border to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their cases. The program was terminated by President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in the White House. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, pledging more humane and orderly immigration policies, but has struggled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Trump also would reinstate the COVID-19-era Title 42 policy, which allowed U.S. border authorities to quickly expel migrants back to Mexico without the chance to claim asylum, he told Time magazine in an interview.\n\nHe would use record border crossings and trafficking of fentanyl and children as reasons for the emergency moves, Time reported, citing comments from advisers. Trump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls \"catch and release.\"\n\nTrump focused on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected. His administration built 450 miles (725 km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,145-km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures. Trump would introduce a border security and immigration bill as one of the first pieces of legislation, Time reported.\n\nMASS DEPORTATIONS Trump has pledged to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, focusing on criminals but aiming to send millions back to their home countries.\n\nTrump told Time he did not rule out building new migrant detention camps but \"there wouldn't be that much of a need for them\" because migrants would be rapidly removed. Trump would rely on the National Guard, if needed, to arrest and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally, he said. When questioned, he also said he would be willing to consider using federal troops if necessary, a step likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\nTrump has also vowed to take aggressive new steps to deport immigrants with criminal records and suspected gang members by using the little-known 1789 Alien Enemies Act. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's first-term immigration agenda, said in an interview last year with a right-wing podcast that National Guard troops from cooperative states could potentially be deployed to what he characterized as \"unfriendly\" states to assist with deportations, which could trigger legal battles.\n\nTRAVEL BANS Trump has said he would implement travel bans on people from certain countries or with certain ideologies, expanding on a policy upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump previewed some parts of the world that could be subjected to a renewed travel ban in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and \"anywhere else that threatens our security.\" During the speech, Trump focused on the conflict in Gaza, saying he would bar the entry of immigrants who support the Islamist militant group Hamas and send deportation officers to pro-Hamas protests.\n\nTrump said last June he would seek to block communists, Marxists and socialists from entering the United States. LEGAL IMMIGRATION Trump said last year that he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to immigrants living in the country illegally, an idea he flirted with as president. Such an action would run against the long-running interpretation of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution and would likely trigger legal challenges. During his first term, Trump greatly reduced the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. and has criticized Biden's decision to increase admissions. He would again suspend the resettlement program if reelected, the New York Times reported in November 2023. Trump has said he would push for a \"a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values.\" In his first term, he took steps to tighten access to some visa programs, including a suspension of many work visas during the COVID pandemic.\n\nTrump has vowed to end Biden \"parole\" programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants with U.S. sponsors to enter the U.S. and obtain work permits, including Ukrainians and Afghans. He has called Biden's programs an \"outrageous abuse of parole authority.\" He would seek to roll back Temporary Protected Status designations, the New York Times reported, targeting another humanitarian program that offers deportation relief and work permits to hundreds of thousands. Trump tried to phase out most Temporary Protected Status enrollment during his first term, but was slowed by legal challenges. A federal appeals court in September 2020 allowed him to proceed with the wind-down, but Biden reversed that and expanded the program after taking office.\n\nFAMILY SEPARATION In a town hall with CNN last year, Trump declined to rule out resuming his contentious \"zero tolerance\" policy that led thousands of migrant children and parents to be separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018. He defended the separations again in November, telling Spanish-language news outlet Univision that \"it stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.\" While Trump has refused to rule out reinstating a family separation policy, key allies who could potentially join a second-term administration are wary, Reuters reported. The Biden administration last October announced a settlement agreement with separated families that would offer them temporary legal status and other benefits while barring similar separations for at least eight years.\n\nDACA Trump tried to end a program that grants deportation relief and work permits to \"Dreamer\" immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, but the termination was rebuffed by the Supreme Court in June 2020. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the Trump administration said it would not accept any new applications to the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, and would explore whether it could again attempt to end it.\n\nTrump plans to try to end DACA if elected, the New York Times reported.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from

Trump Media stock is sometimes labeled as a meme stock because of the attention former President Donald Trump receives. Sensible investors can find reasons to hold this stock.\n\nTrump Media, first and foremost, will sink or swim as the holding company of the Truth Social media platform. Thus, Trump Media's investors should be able to envision the future growth of Truth Social.\n\nSure, you can and should consider the meme-stock angle with Trump Media stock. Just don't get too distracted because you'll miss the real story here and, potentially, a buying opportunity.\n\nFor one thing, I don't recommend investing in Trump Media as a get-rich-quick scheme. Patience will be the key that unlocks success with Trump Media stock.\n\nSometimes, there will be setbacks and delays. For example, earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged former Trump Media auditor BF Borgers CPA with \"massive fraud.\"\n\nTrump Media promptly addressed this problem by appointing a new auditor, Semple, Marchal & Cooper, LLP. This doesn't mean that the issue is entirely cleared up, though.\n\nAn SEC filing revealed that Trump Media won't be able to submit its first-quarter financial information on time. This development shouldn't come as a huge surprise, but it might disappoint some investors.\n\nWe'll all just have to wait patiently for Trump Media's next quarterly financial filing. In the meantime, just think about whether you have a firm belief in Truth Social as an alternative-media outlet.\n\nAlso, remember Truth Social's revenue grew at a rapid rate, from $1.47 million in 2022 to $4.13 million in 2023.\n\nI recently came across a Barron's article stating that Trump Media failed the meme stock test. That declaration took me by surprise, but it actually makes sense and could even be considered a compliment to Trump Media.\n\nBy now, you may have heard about the huge mid-May short squeeze in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock. This occurred after a popular Reddit user and meme-stock trader reemerged on social media after a long hiatus.\n\nGameStock stock and AMC Entertainment stock rallied sharply, but Trump Media stock made a much smaller move. This shouldn't be considered a letdown, though.\n\nIf anything, it's just a sign that Trump Media's shareholders might not have to deal with extreme volatility anymore. Finally, the process of price discovery might be almost over, and Trump Media's investors can enjoy some stability.\n\nOr at least, one can hope that Trump Media stock won't behave in a meme-like fashion until the November election. Then, Trump Media's shareholders will probably need to brace for a wild, volatile month or two.\n\nThe best reason to own Trump Media stock is because you expect Truth Social to grow its revenue and eventually turn a profit. It's really that simple, but meme-stock comparisons to GameStop and AMC Entertainment can easily distract investors.\n\nAt the same time, it's important to be patient with Trump Media and prepare for election-time volatility. If you're on board with all of that, feel free to buy and hold a few shares of Trump Media stock.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_moadel@investorplace.com", "name": "David Moadel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Media_&_Technology_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump Media & Technology Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meme stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get-rich-quick_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Get-rich-quick scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMC Theatres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Certified Public Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short squeeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GameStop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community Video", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Organizations", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dwac1600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 90, "relevance": 1}

Look at [George W] Bush and Tony Blair. Fabulous relationship.\n\n\"I hope there's a strong relationship if there's a change of government,\" he added.\n\nMr Fleitz's comments could signal that Mr Trump has so far, not been influenced by the Conservative party's claim that Starmer cannot be trusted with national security if he becomes Prime Minister.\n\nDuring a visit to the US to meet Republican and Democrat officials earlier this month, shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Trump allies including the Senator for Ohio JD Vance, Elbridge Colby - who was his administration's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense - and Senator Lindsey Graham.\n\nMr Fleitz, a former CIA agent, was Deputy Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff of the National Security Council during Mr Trump's first term in office. The pair are in regular touch to discuss national security and foreign policy and he has offered his services to a potential second Trump administration.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, which also touched on how Mr Trump might approach foreign policy if he is re-elected, Mr Fleitz revealed the Republican candidate's bold ambition to broker a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and bring Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. But more than two years into the war, such an ambition is likely to be met with widespread scepticism on the global stage.\n\nDuring Mr Trump's first term as president there was, at times, a difficult relationship with the UK. Following his inauguration in January 2017, the then prime minister Theresa May was the first foreign leader to meet with him.\n\nMrs May then invited Mr Trump for a State Visit, during which the former president broke protocol by walking in front of the Queen at a military inspection at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe visit drew protests and a six-metre high inflatable 'baby blimp' of Mr Trump was flown over Parliament Square during the visit.\n\nMrs May is said to have made efforts to establish a beneficial working relationship with Mr Trump but this was sometimes described as \"dysfunctional\". It was reported that, in their phone calls, Mr Trump made a habit of interrupting Mrs May.\n\nIn November 2017, Mr Trump retweeted an anti-Muslim post from the far-right group Britain First. The move was condemned across the British political spectrum, and a spokesman for Mrs May said it had been \"wrong of the president to have done this\".\n\nIn response, Mr Trump tweeted: \"Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!\"\n\nThe dispute between the pair was understood to have weakened the perception of a strong \"special relationship\" under Mrs May's leadership and undermined her efforts to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson took after as prime minister in 2019, Mr Trump was said to be so fond of him that he gave him his private phone number.\n\nBut they had a complex relationship when they were both in office. Mr Trump once described Mr Johnson as a friend and \"Britain'[s] Trump\" - but in an interview with GB News last year, he appeared to criticise the former prime minister's government. He said Mr Johnson's government took a \"far left\" tilt, particularly on eco policies.\n\n\"They weren't really staying conservative,\" he said.\n\nMr Fleitz, who currently works with the think tank America First Policy Institute (AFPI), said he believes that a second term for Mr Trump would lead to \"quick progress\" in establishing peace in Ukraine, but that President Zelensky would have to agree to wait until Mr Putin is out of office before his nation secures all its territory back from Russia, including Crimea.\n\nThe view of both the Conservatives and Labour is that Ukraine should be given the weapons it needs to regain all its land and defeat Mr Putin, lining up a potential area for disagreement with the US should Mr Trump win in November.\n\n\"If we can get Ukraine through 2024, with Trump's leadership, we could start a peace process next year,\" said Mr Fleitz.\n\n\"We don't call for Ukraine to give up territory. We think there should be a ceasefire and there should be a process for Ukraine to get back its territory, which may not be concluded until Putin leaves the political scene.\"\n\nHe added that the West should \"arm Ukraine to the teeth\" to prevent a Russian victory and to protect it during any ceasefire, but that European members of Nato should take the majority of the burden of funding the military aid.\n\n\"I think a real sticking point with Trump is a very low amount that France and Germany are paying for arming Ukraine,\" added Mr Fleitz.\n\n\"I know the UK is doing its part and most East European nation states are giving a larger percentage of their GDP than the US, but this is a European conflict.\n\n\"I believe Trump's position would be that Europe has to pay the lion's share of defending Ukraine.\"\n\nMr Fleitz believes the AFPI's new book, An America First Approach to US National Security, provides a blueprint for Mr Trump's foreign policy if he wins a second term.\n\nAs Congress held up the $61bn military aid package to Ukraine, Mr Fleitz claims he sent the chapter from the book on Ukraine to Mr Trump ahead of its publication this month.\n\nIt recommended providing the aid, and Mr Trump responded by sending the chapter back to Mr Fleitz, having signed it with the words \"good job\".\n\nMr Trump went on to change his mind on the aid package and it finally passed a vote in Congress in April.\n\nMr Fleitz, who attended Mr Trump's Florida mansion Mar-a-Lago in early March for talks with Hungary's populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, added that the former president would continue his fight for more Nato members to spend at least 2 per cent on defence should he beat Mr Biden in the presidential race.\n\nIn February, Mr Trump raised fears that he could take the US out of the West's security alliance, saying he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to Nato countries which did not meet their financial obligations to the alliance.\n\nHe has since reassured Nato allies that he is \"100 per cent\" behind Nato so long as European countries \"play fair\".\n\nMr Fleitz also dismissed the possibility of Mr Trump pulling the US out of Nato despite some commentators suggesting he would do so if other members do not hit minimum defence spending levels.\n\n\"I don't think there's any scenario that will happen,\" said Mr Fleitz. \"But I do think there's going to be a very hard push on Nato members to meet their treaty obligations.\"\n\nAway from foreign policy Mr Fleitz said that the legal issues faced by Mr Trump are only serving to boost his popularity with American voters.\n\nThe 77-year-old became the first former president in US history to face a criminal trial when the hush money case involving former adult film actress Stormy Daniels came before a New York court in April.\n\nWhile the jury in this case will begin deliberating its verdict this week, Mr Trump faces three further cases after the one currently occupying him in New York.\n\nDespite the charges levelled against him, the average of the latest polling gives Mr Trump a narrow lead in the race.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_parsley@inews.co.uk", "name": "David Parsley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_H._Fleitz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frederick H.

Instead, he said he told the donor that he wanted a $25 million or $50 million contribution or he would not be \"very happy.\"\n\nAs he closed his pitch at the Pierre Hotel, Trump explained to the group why it was in their interest to cut large checks. If he was not put back in office, taxes would go up for them under President Biden, who vows to let Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations expire at the end of 2025.\n\n\"The tax cuts all expire for wealthy and poor and middle-income and everything else, but they expire in another seven months and he's not going to renew them, which means taxes are going to go up by four times,\" Trump reportedly said.\n\n\"You're going to have the biggest tax increase in history. So whatever you guys can do, I appreciate it,\" concluded the former president who has been trailing Biden in fundraising throughout the 2024 campaign.\n\nEarlier in May, the Post also reported that Trump huddled with executives from many of the country's largest oil companies and told them they need to donate $1 billion to his campaign. In exchange for the massive donation, Trump promised to make sure they got whatever environmental regulations that required from the government to maximize their businesses.\n\n\"Trump's offer of a blatant quid pro quo to oil executives is practically an invitation to ask questions about Big Oil's political corruption and manipulation,\" Sen.

Treasury yields will fluctuate. The US Dollar could become unhinged. Marriages will crumble, plate tectonics will agitate...\n\nBut the pressure will start cooking, says Dr Shane Oliver, head of Investment Strategy and chief economist, AMP, should former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump remain ahead of incumbent US President Joe Biden in the polls.\n\nThat'll give investors time to have a think about the risks and reactions of a return to those Trumpian themes.\n\nThe fallout of a renewed US-led trade war, the uncertainty of key US relationships, defence spending, taxes, budgets, social cohesion...\n\n\"Or even the hit to both US jobs and the independence of the US Federal Reserve,\" Dr Oliver told Stockhead.\n\nHistorically, Shane says, shares and their markets have performed better under Democrat than Republican presidents with the best outcome typically being a Democrat president and Republican House or Senate control.\n\nAnd what about us? What will happen to Aussie? How will Australia - so far from the worries of Washington - fare under another Trump presidency?\n\nWell. Rather than try to answer them ourselves, we just fed the data, these questions and other various unknowns around the US presidential election into the Authentic Intelligence bot that is Dr Shane Oliver.\n\n\"Firstly, a few words from your Shane-bot on some bemusing Authentic Artificial Intelligence...\n\n\"Over the years I have been alerted to various fake Shane Oliver accounts on Twitter/X (which we have reported and had removed - although I suspect there may still be more).\n\n\"More recently I have heard of various scams in my name offering trading schemes with one involving a WhatsApp account. And this week a colleague discovered numerous fake Shane Oliver accounts on Facebook and a fake website (shane-oliver.com) with lots of my material and interviews with the site directing people to a WhatsApp account (presumably phishing). Again we have reported these but they are harder to take down.\n\n\"It's part of the world we live in and imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but I don't post to a Facebook account having my name (so any account doing that is a fake), I don't run my own website and I do not solicit funds or spruik trading schemes**.\"\n\nED:**Fake Shane-bots don't abruptly segue into the magic of a superbly crafted synth-pop track.\n\n\"In the late 1980s/early 1990s the music production team of Stock Aiken Waterman were derided for churning out hit after hit of electro pop resulting in more than 100 top 40 hits in the UK.\n\n\"Success often builds contempt. DJs hated them as did record companies who couldn't work out how they were having so much success with just a handful of people.\n\n\"But their songs certainly had magic in them and were catchy and bright (just what I like).\n\n\"Here's one of their best and I'll have a think about another one while we talk Trading Trump.\n\nIt's nearly four years since the tumultuous 2020 US presidential election and the next one is almost upon us. So far markets have paid scant attention to it or have instead focussed on the upside if Mr Trump returns (thinking: lower taxes and less regulation)... can we assume all that's going to change as the showdown to November 5th draws near?\n\nDr Shane:\n\nWell that's just a terrific question. With the first debate scheduled for 27 June and with a Trump victory running the risk of weakening US democracy and US global alliances and threatening a big ramp up in protectionism and a further reversal in free trade.\n\nBeing unable to run for a third term, a second Trump presidency will lack the electoral constraints of his first term (which led to the Phase One trade deal with China) and is likely to have less \"adults in the room\".\n\n\"Real Clear Politics poll average has Biden trailing Trump by 1 to 2 points in terms of favourability and presidential voting intentions.\n\n\"This is well behind where he was at the same point in 2020.\"\n\nBiden also lags Trump by around 1 to 9 points in key battleground states, whereas he was leading at this point in 2020, Shane says.\n\nThe 'PredictIt' betting market puts Mr Trump on 51% probability of winning versus Mr Biden on 44%, having just crossed over from favouring Biden.\n\n\"If Trump wins, it's likely the Republicans would regain control of the Senate (where they have an edge as the Democrats need to defend more seats) and keep the House, resulting in a clean sweep.\"\n\nBut, there's still like (counts on fingers) five months to go. That's an eon in Aussie politics... so you're not suggesting we should just pack it in and call this one for the Republicans?\n\nFirst, the historical record indicates incumbent presidents tend to be reelected if there is no recession in the two years before the election.\n\nSince 1932, all incumbents seeking re-election have failed if this was not the case. While leading indicators point to a high risk of recession, so far the economy has been strong.\n\nSecond, normally around July in the election year incumbent presidents start to see an upswing in support.\n\nThird, polls indicate that roughly 14% are undecided and they often don't make up their minds until the end of the party conventions (July/August).\n\nFourth, around 20-25% of Trump supporters indicate that they will reconsider if he is convicted of a crime. Of course, several of the stronger cases against him have been delayed likely leaving the arguably less threatening for Trump New York \"hush money\" case.\n\nFinally... while third party candidate Robert F Kennedy is more of a threat to Biden than Trump, it's likely he will be convinced to exit the race.\n\nOf course, it can all blow the other way if there is a surge in oil prices (e.g. if the Israel war expands to include Iran and Russia curtails its energy exports in the hope it will support Trump who as president will cut support for Ukraine) and the economy slides into recession.\n\nTaxation:\n\nTrump would look to make the 2017 corporate and personal tax cuts (which took the corporate rate to 21% and the top marginal tax rate to 37%) permanent (as they expire in 2025 which would result in higher taxes under Biden) and to lower them possibly further.\n\nTrade:\n\nTrump is threatening to impose a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on all imports from China. This would take the average US tariff rate from around 2.5% to around 17%, far surpassing the 3% peak seen in Trump's first term. This may be \"maximum pressure\" bluster, but while \"we shouldn't take him literally, we should take him seriously.\"\n\nBiden has basically maintained Trump's China tariffs and recently announced he will add to them (but only on 4% of imports from China) and has dramatically ramped up subsidies for manufacturing in America.\n\nThis is part of a broader global trend towards protectionism and deglobalisation.\n\nTrump (who sees the US trade deficit as a sign that America is being ripped off) would likely dramatically ramp this up accelerating the process of deglobalisation and adding to the likelihood of global trade wars as other countries retaliate on a far bigger scale than in 2018-19 and without political considerations getting in the way (as he can't have a third term).\n\nImmigration:\n\nImmigration has surged under Biden making it a big issue and Trump will likely aggressively curtail both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nFed independence:\n\nTrump would seek to replace Jerome Powell and his supporters are looking at ways to roll back the Fed's independence.\n\nClimate policy:\n\nTrump will likely reverse the US' net zero commitments and most of the policies Biden introduced to support it. Subsidies for green manufacturing are likely to be replaced with wider industry subsidies.\n\nRegulation:\n\nTrump is likely to slash regulation particularly benefitting the energy and financial sectors.\n\nBudget deficit:\n\nThe deficit remains huge (at 6.3% of GDP) owing to big government spending. It would likely get bigger under Trump's tax policies.\n\nAlrighty then Shane-bot. From an economic perspective what might be some of the actions from the White House and what could we imagine some of the the reactions might be?\n\nDr Oliver:\n\nTrump's policies in support of tax cuts and deregulation could help boost the supply side of the US economy via a boost to productivity (which is already on the mend and will be helped by the rapid take up of AI in the US). However, on balance Trump's policies - with higher tariffs and hence higher import prices, sharply lower labour force growth and moves to weaken the Fed's inflation fighting credentials - will likely add to inflation.\n\nThere is also a risk that a higher budget deficit, with no sign of improvement at a time when US public debt is now very high (at 125% of GDP), will result in a market backlash and higher bond yields.\n\nFurthermore, his brinkmanship and erratic policy making style is likely to add to policy uncertainty which could hamper business investment.\n\nA lot will depend on the sequencing of his policy moves. If he runs with tax cuts first it could boost the economy in say 2025, but if he runs first with sharp tariff hikes, immigration cuts & an attack on the Fed it could be taken more negatively early on. In 2017 he ran with the positives first to help shore up the economy, but this time around he may run with negatives first as there will be no constraint from the desire to win another election.\n\nFirstly, despite the heightened policy uncertainty the election year is normally an okay year for US shares. Since 1927, the election year, or year 4 in the presidential cycle, has had a return of around 12%.\n\nSecond, the run up to the election will likely see increased share market volatility if Trump remains ahead and investors start to focus on the risks of a new trade war, a hit to the US labour force and to the Fed under Trump.\n\nAfter Trump's victory in 2016 shares soared 38% to January 2018 as the focus in his first year was on business-friendly tax cuts and deregulation but they fell in 2018 as the focus shifted to trade wars.\n\nSo, if there is a Trump victory, the share market's reaction in the first 6-12 months will be heavily influenced by his sequencing of tariff hikes versus tax cuts.\n\nThird, historically US shares have done best under Democrat presidents with an average return of 14.4% pa since 1927 compared to an average return under Republican presidents of 10% pa. However, the best average result has actually occurred when there has been a Democrat president and Republican control of the House, the Senate or both and the worst average return has been when there's been a clean Republican sweep.\n\nFinally, a Trump presidency would likely mean higher bond yields (with somewhat higher inflation and budget deficits) and a higher $US (partly reflecting higher global economic uncertainty and the impact of US tariffs).\n\nOk. What would it all mean for how we go about our business here at home. What'd be the implications of a retrun to Trump for Australia?\n\nDr Oliver:\n\nAs a relatively open economy with high trade exposure to China, Australia would be vulnerable to an intensification of global trade wars as a result of a Trump victory, particularly if it weighs on demand for Chinese exports.\n\nAn OECD study showed that Australia could suffer a 1.2% reduction in GDP as a result of a 10% reduction in global trade between major countries.\n\nThis is second only to Korea in OECD countries and reflects Australia's high exposure to China. Resources shares would be most at risk and the $A would likely fall. Of course, similar fears existed during the last Trump trade war, and it didn't turn out so bad.\n\nMuch would depend on how other countries respond and how hard Trump goes.\n\nOkay.... But ...it's just when you say it like that - with a sudden degree of emphasis - that I can only assume you're pretty sure Trump's going to win.\n\nAs promised ladies and gents, give it up for one of Our Own - Kylie Minogue's kick your shoes off and have a boogie number 1 single -", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stockhead"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_edwards@stockhead.com.au", "name": "Christian Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synth-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Synth-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PredictIt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PredictIt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

As per NBC News, the National Rifle Association is officially supporting Trump over President Joe Biden.

Getting ambitious during his speech, Trump floated the idea of him occupying the White House for a third term. \"You know, FDR 16 years -- almost 16 years -- he was four terms. I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term? Or two-term?\" Trump asked as per Politico.\n\nThe audience responded, \"Three.\" Trump recently also told Time Magazine, \"I wouldn't be in favor of it at all.

Legal immigrants are punished, while illegals are given free hotels and prepaid Visa cards.\n\nMany minority voters adore Trump and cannot stand Joe Biden. (We've got the clips to prove it).\n\nEven though the media claims that Trump is a racist, bigot, and anti-immigrant, Black and Latino voters know better. They believe that Biden is the REAL racist, for claiming that if you don't vote for him, 'you ain't black', a comment they (rightfully) find offensive.\n\nEven the leftist media is getting panicky over all the Trump support in blue districts like the Bronx. Watch the clip below, in which a CNN reporter admits that there was a large turnout one of the \"bluest districts in the country.\"\n\nIn this clip below, an NBC reporter says that Bronx voters love Trump. They resent Biden. She even admits that she pushed back and tried to convince them that Trump is a racist, but she was unsuccessful.\n\nPLUS:\n\nThe Trump criminal trial will begin closing arguments this week. Will Trump be acquitted? Hung jury?\n\nCLIP: AOC admits the criminal trial is designed to keep Trump off the campaign trail.\n\nOhio has threatened to remove Biden from the November election ballot.\n\nCLIP: Bill Maher falsely claims that Hillary Clinton never called Trump an \"illegitimate president\", then gets immediately fact-checked and is forced to backtrack.\n\nCLIP: A reporter asked KJP why student loan borrowers deserve to have their loans forgiven, and why the rest of America does not deserve a free gift of $35,000\n\nHunter Biden allegedly perjured himself at least 3 times when testifying in Congress.

Trump, currently facing 34 felony counts in criminal court, is campaigning for re-election this fall by taking shots at the increasingly popular electric car industry. Trump has already called for oil and gas industry executives to donate significant campaign funds in exchange for a reversal of Biden administration climate policies. If elected this November, Trump would roll back tailpipe emissions targets and dramatically slash EV tax credits. These policies may prove unpopular even among Republican voters, as electric vehicle production has spurred job growth and investment in southern states.\n\nThe automotive landscape is a far different place than it was in 2016 when Trump gained the presidency. Despite his best efforts, the EV market has grown significantly in the last eight years. Just 159,139 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. in 2016, and that number is expected to exceed 1.5 million (or 10 percent of U.S. new car sales) in 2024. Even if Donald Trump were to be elected and hit the brakes on EV tax credits, the market may already be at a tipping point of growth. The electric car market has jumped the chasm between early adopters and mainstream consumers. Analysts predict widespread EV adoption will continue to develop regardless of Donald Trump's actions, though perhaps at a reduced pace.\n\nWilliam Clay Ford Jr., executive chair of Ford Motor, told the New York Times: \"Our time frame as a company, our planning time frame, is a lot longer than election cycles,\" Mr. Ford said at an event organized by the Detroit Free Press last month. \"When we're whipsawed back and forth by politicians that becomes really difficult for us.\"\n\nInvestment in U.S. manufacturing spurred by President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act will continue apace even with a second term for Donald Trump. Hyundai, for example, is investing $13 billion on electric vehicle production in Georgia, a state Donald Trump narrowly lost by 12,000 votes in 2020. By threatening the livelihoods of blue collar American workers, Trump may be doing more harm than good for his case in these manufacturing-reliant states.\n\nWith billions of investment on the books from automakers, charging companies, dealership networks, and advertising, it seems unlikely that Donald Trump can stop the rolling bolder that is the EV market. Republican strongholds Texas and Florida are increasingly adopting electric vehicles as their chosen mode of transport, trailing only California in terms of EV registrations. Electric vehicles seem to be equally popular among Republican and Democrat consumers. Alienating regular working-class Americans in an appeal to his fervent base seems to be Donald Trump's raison d'etre, so we'll have to wait until November to see if it actually works.", "source":

Instead, in a surprise move, 25 Republican senators blocked the measure on Wednesday even though they had voted for it just a month earlier.

You crossed the demilitarized zone into North Korea with no security as a sign of goodwill and peace with a hostile nation, and I've had people tell me it never happened. So, uh, I think people need to know about it. I'm wondering if you can just tell me how, how did that happen? How did it come to be?\"\n\n\"And it hasn't happened since,\" Trump said. \"And we were, when I met with, you know, the hand-off, you sort of meet with the previous president for a period of time. The meeting lasted for quite a while with President Obama. You sit in an Oval Office, and you talk, and the press is outside, and you talk for a little while. He said that the single greatest threat we have is North Korea. And I said, 'Have you called them? Have you tried to talk to them?' You know, little things like that. And, uh, didn't matter what the answer was. He felt that that was the single biggest threat in the world, was North Korea.\" (RELATED: 'Let's Make Some News Tonight!': Trump Drops Hints To Reporter About His Running Mate)\n\n\"And as you know, there was certainly hostility when I first started, and all of a sudden, it boiled down to something that was very beautiful, the way it happened,\" the former president continued. \"And I got along with him very well. And I will say that if Hillary won that race, you would have had a nuclear war and millions of people would have been killed. And you weren't even close to that. It never happened; it never was going to happen. I got along great with him, and it just never was going to happen.\"\n\nTrump shook hands with Kim Jong Un on June 30, 2019 after crossing 20 steps into North Korea from South Korea at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Special Agent in Charge Anthony Ornato accompanied Trump as he walked into North Korea, according to The Associated Press (AP). Trump and Kim Jong Un held a joint press conference following the historic meeting, and Trump told Pool that \"everybody was pretty radically thrown out\" at the end.\n\n\"Were you ever at all scared in any way when you crossed into an enemy country?\" Pool asked.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't say the Secret Service was thrilled,\" Trump remarked.\n\n\"I felt very safe. I felt my relationship with him, as you know, was very hostile. Little Rocket Man, and all,\" Trump said, repeating his nickname for the North Korean dictator. \"But then all of a sudden, it morphed. He respected me, I respected him. And we ended up, once we got to know each other, we ended up very good. Very smart guy, very strong guy. He's the absolute leader of that country, you know, for those that think he's not, they're wrong.\"\n\n\"If we have the right president, if we have somebody that knows what he's doing, you're not gonna have World War III. If, on the other hand, we don't, you're gonna end up in World War III, and it's gonna be a war like no other because of the power of weaponry,\" the former president noted.\n\nPool told Trump that \"many are actually saying we're already in\" World War III, citing an article published by The Hill that claims President Joe Biden is \"losing it.\" The Republican candidate agreed, arguing that foreign leaders \"can't believe\" the condition of Biden as President of the United States.\n\n\"He can't fix anything. He can't fix himself,\" Trump said of Biden. \"Just so you know, I know all the leaders. They're at the top of their game. They're sharp, they're tough, they're smart. They're, they love their country, or they do whatever they have to for their country at a minimum. And when they see this guy come in, they think they -- they can't believe it. I know they can't believe it. It's not the right person.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean Demilitarized Zone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Libertarian Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Swimming_Pools_and_Spas", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Swimming Pools and Spas", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2154672090-scaled-e1716905063431.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-30", "textStart": 2094, "textEnd": 2107}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 77, "relevance": 1}

BitcoinMagazine CEO replied to Trump that he had some ideas but failed to talk about his ideas, as he wasn't ready to talk about them in their first meeting.\n\nThis is very big news for Bitcoin enthusiasts, as Trump is most expected to be the next US president.\n\nHowever recently Trump passed several Bitcoin-friendly statements to get political benefits from the crypto community but this disclosed information is totally different, as he is actually looking toward Bitcoin adoption for the USA & he didn't talk about this thing publicly.\n\nIn the past many times, the US current president Joe Biden has been criticized by the opposition political leaders because of the surged national debt in the USA.\n\nAs per survey reports, currently, Donald Trump has a 56% winning chance against Biden.", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National debt of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://bitcoinik.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Donald-Trump-1-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601578", "eventUri": "eng-9601578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 73, "relevance": 1}

If Trump is reelected this year, then this world will no longer exist as it is, it will fall apart. Then the Pax Americana ends. What we see is a bipolar world, with China, Russia plus Iran and North Korea on the other side, whose goals are anti-democratic. They are ready to do anything for their agenda. And we really don't have answers, our answer is full of contradictions.\n\nThe real problem is how Trump has radicalized the Republicans. Whether it's immigration or gun rights -- the Republicans are taking increasingly radical positions. The party of Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush has been unrecognizable since the rise of Trump. How did it come to this? How many members of the Republican Party consider the storming of the Capitol to be a heroic act? According to a survey conducted by ABC television and Ipos Institute almost a year later, more than half of Republicans said the mob in Washington had \"protected democracy.\"\n\nBesides the fact that dozens of court rulings confirmed that there were no significant irregularities in 2020.\n\nAs is well known, there are two political parties in the USA that are fundamentally different in almost every respect.\n\nTheir voters can often be identified by their appearance: dark-skinned and young people are likely to vote for the Democrats, while older white pick-up drivers are usually Republicans. The places of residence also vary: the vast majority of Republicans live in rural areas, while Democrats live in the big cities. The Republican Party is increasingly taking on the characteristics of a cult.\n\nIt is not society that has become radicalized, but the Republican Party. The Republicans have become an increasingly anti-immigration party since Trump, in June 2015, stood in front of a microphone, announced his candidacy and at the same time declared that Mexico was mainly sending rapists and bandits across the border. Trump's language towards immigrants has become as vile as it is inhumane -- he claims that they \"poison the blood of our country.\"\n\nThe extremism of Trump supporters find its worst expression in their advocacy of political violence: in a survey in January 2021, 39 percent of Republicans believed it was justified to fight political opponents with violence.\n\nTrump had never made a secret of the fact that he admired Putin -- along with other dictators Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, Turkey's Erdogan. He also never hid his disgust with Ukraine.\n\nSo if Trump is going to win the next election, you know what you can expect.", "source": {"uri": "sunstar.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun.Star Network Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sunstar_cebu@sunstar.com.ph", "name": "SunStar Cebu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pax Americana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Here's what each outcome could mean for the election.", "body": "By Julia Terruso, The Philadelphia Inquirer The Tribune Content Agency\n\nTwelve jurors in New York City are poised to make history when they reveal the verdict in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president.\n\nThe decision could influence some voters in a close presidential race in key swing states like Pennsylvania with six months until the election.\n\nClosing arguments in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial are slated for Tuesday with jury deliberations likely to start on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee engaged in a strategy to acquire and suppress unfavorable news stories, to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to cover up the purported scheme. It's the first of Trump's four criminal cases to go to trial, and likely the only one to be tried before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nAs the campaign barrels toward November, the hush money trial has done little to shift a tight race. That's partly because polling shows few voters are paying attention to it.\n\nIn a recent YouGov/Yahoo News poll, just 16% of respondents said they'd been following the trial \"very closely,\" with one-third saying they were taking a mild interest in proceedings. More Americans said the trial made them feel \"bored\" or \"angry\" than interested.\n\nThat's somewhat surprising given the salacious subject matter - a former adult film star detailing an alleged sexual encounter with a presidential candidate. But Trump has a long history of outrageous behavior, and if the facts of the case have not motivated voters en masse, a legal outcome of them might not either.\n\n\"I think even his most ardent supporters, given who he is, can believe everything they said he did,\" GOP consultant Chris Nicholas said. \"Whether it ends up being found to be felonious criminally is another story.\"\n\nHere's what we're watching for in the three scenarios that could play out.\n\nIf Donald Trump is found guilty\n\nIf the jury finds Trump guilty, he would be eligible for a prison sentence, an unprecedented scenario that the Secret Service is already taking preemptive steps to prepare for.\n\nEach of the 34 felony falsification of business records charges that Trump is facing carries a sentence of up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If Trump is found guilty, Judge Juan Merchan would have a lot of leeway. He could sentence Trump to probation, house arrest, or prison.\n\nGiven Trump, 77, has no prior criminal record, many legal experts say it's unlikely the judge would impose a prison sentence. Trump would also likely appeal a guilty verdict, and any jail time would be stayed as the appeal continues through the court system, a process that could take months, if not years.\n\nStill, the case against Trump for Democrats and Biden becomes easier to make with a guilty verdict. The Biden campaign is preparing to start referring to Trump as \"convicted felon Donald Trump,\" should he be found guilty.\n\nAnd polling has indicated a guilty verdict could erode some support.\n\nA March Politico and Ipsos survey found that a conviction could cost Trump more than one-third of independents. A February NBC News poll showed that a conviction in the New York trial could trigger a big swing from 18- to 34-year-old voters from Trump to Biden. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey from late April found that 20% of Trump supporters polled would \"either reconsider their support (16%) or withdraw it (4%)\" if he's convicted.\n\nThere's little sign that avid supporters have abandoned Trump over his legal troubles in states like Pennsylvania, but even smaller shifts could matter in a tight race.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, will likely continue to run - and fundraise - off of the trial, no matter the outcome. He's turned the indictments into unifying rallying calls to his supporters.\n\n\"Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor,\" Trump said in his recent rally in Wildwood. \"I am being indicted for you and never forget our enemies want to take my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom. They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.\"\n\nIf Donald Trump is acquitted\n\nAs he did in Wildwood, Trump, for months, has categorized the case against him as a politically motivated prosecution. An acquittal would represent validation for Trump, his supporters, and his lineup of potential running mates, many of whom have packed the courtroom.\n\nWhile he faces three other criminal trials, it's unlikely any of those cases will conclude ahead of the general election, meaning an acquittal frees Trump from the possibility of running as a convicted candidate - or a candidate in jail.\n\nThat could help him among undecided voters with whom the outcome of the cases carries some weight.\n\nTrump leads Biden in national polls and most swing states but in Pennsylvania his lead is narrow. His challenge has always been how to expand his base beyond a dedicated core. Running on an acquittal helps him make the case to moderates and independent voters.\n\nIt puts Biden's Democratic surrogates in a more difficult position having spent months defending the trial against Trump.\n\nAnd while an acquittal wouldn't directly impact the other pending cases in Florida, Georgia, and Washington, it could shape public perception and influence potential juries in those states.\n\nIf the jury hangs\n\nIf the jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge will likely declare a mistrial. The Manhattan district attorney can then choose to retry the case with a new jury. But the runway to the election is shortening, making a retrial before November unlikely.\n\nTrump would likely cast a mistrial as a win.\n\nWhatever the outcome, how both candidates respond could carry almost as much weight as the decision. Biden has avoided commenting on the legal cases, but his campaign indicated he'll make a statement on the verdict.\n\nAnd Trump will be even more free to speak out with the trial behind him.\n\n\"The wild card, of course, is how does he respond?\" Nicholas, the GOP consultant, said. \"Once the verdict is in, he doesn't have the gag order anymore, so he's off to the races in terms of what he says.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_terruso@heraldonline.com", "name": "Julia Terruso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial, although prosecutors could seek a new trial.\n\nbur/cl/sms\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com",

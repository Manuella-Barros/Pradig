The incident, which occurred in the afternoon of May 2, 2024, has raised serious concerns about potential neglect and the safety of children at the popular theme park.\n\nAccording to reports from The Guardian, the incident took place around 1pm local time at Legoland Windsor Resort. The young boy, whose identity has not been disclosed, suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while visiting the theme park with his family. He was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital and remains in critical condition, receiving intensive medical care.\n\nIn response to the alarming nature of the incident, law enforcement authorities swiftly intervened. A 27-year-old woman, whose name has not been revealed to the public, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of neglecting the child in a manner that led to his serious injury. While the specifics of the allegations remain undisclosed, the woman has been released on bail pending further investigation, with her next court appearance scheduled for July 26.\n\nDC Zoe Eele, representing the Thames Valley Police's child abuse investigation unit, issued a statement expressing the gravity of the situation. DC Eele conveyed heartfelt sympathies to the family of the young boy, emphasizing the collaborative efforts between law enforcement agencies and Legoland Windsor Resort in seeking clarity and justice.\n\n\"We are investigating a distressing incident involving a very young child at Legoland Windsor earlier this week. Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the boy who is in a critical condition in the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest.

They are specifically appealing to individuals who may have been present at Legoland Windsor Resort during the time of the incident, particularly those who were queuing for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between approximately 11.30 and 12.45 on the day in question.

Guests and staff were asked to leave the area and barriers were set up stopping anyone from wandering in. Other rides nearby were closed too. It sounds dramatic, but people were calm. I saw two ambulances drive down towards the ride and one of the vehicles parked directly outside the face-painting stand.\n\nThe baby took ill near the Coastguard HQ ride\n\n\"I didn't see what happened, but I was told that there had been some kind of an incident in or around the queue to the Coastguard ride. The baby boy had been in a pram at the time and there was a woman with him - I don't know if she's the same person who was later arrested. From where I was working, I couldn't see any police so I don't know if they actually spoke to her in the park. The police have been since the incident, I believe, to check the CCTV.\"\n\nThe staff member continued, clarifying that the ride was a \"slow boat ride\" that was suitable for children.

In the UK, a five-month-old is critical in the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at a theme park last Thursday. Image used for representational purposes/Pixabay\n\nHeart health is one of the most discussed topics in the world of medicine. In 2019, coronary heart disease was known as the world's single biggest killer. However, when one discusses heart diseases, we most often refer to men or women being victims of it.\n\nHowever, a recent incident has thrown the spotlight of heart diseases, namely cardiac arrests, in small children, even as young as just few months old. Last Thursday (2 May), a five-month-old boy suffered a cardiac arrest at Legoland Windsor Resort in the United Kingdom. While the baby is in critical condition in hospital, a 27-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of neglecting a child to cause unnecessary injury.\n\nWe take a closer look at how prominent is the problem of cardiac arrests in children and the reasons behind it.\n\nCardiac arrest in the young\n\nOn 2 May, a five-month-old boy suffered a cardiac arrest while he was at Legoland Windsor in the UK. According to authorities, he is still in a critical condition in hospital.\n\nDetective Con Zoe Eele, of Thames Valley Police's Child Abuse Investigation Unit, was quoted as telling the BBC: \"Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the boy who is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest.\n\n\"We are working closely with the team at Legoland Windsor Resort but would like to speak to anyone who have information about this incident, specifically anyone who was queueing for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between around 11.30am and 12:45pm. I would ask for the public to please avoid speculation about the incident and to respect the boy's family at this deeply upsetting time.\"\n\nAnd the case of the five-month-old isn't a single incident. Earlier in January, a five-year-old girl died in Uttar Pradesh's Amroha of heart failure while watching cartoons on her mother's phone. Her medical reports later confirmed that her death was caused due to a sudden heart attack.\n\nBack in May last year, a 16-year-old boy from India's Telangana was out shopping when he experienced chest pain and collapsed; he was immediately taken to a local hospital. Unfortunately, he passed away.\n\nExperts note that while sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) among children and the young are rare, it does happen. In fact, according to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, each year, SCA claims the lives of over 2,000 children and adolescents in the US and accounts for approximately three-five per cent of all deaths in children aged 5-19 years. It is also responsible for 10-15 per cent of sudden unexpected infant deaths.\n\nWeak hearts of the young\n\nBut what's causing young children to suffer sudden cardiac arrests ? Doctors note that in young people, sudden cardiac death is most often genetic or congenital in nature. Acquired forms of heart disease that lead to sudden cardiac death are rare but possible.\n\nAs per a report in Medical News Today, one of the most common causes of sudden cardiac arrest in young people is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This occurs when the walls of the heart become thicker and stiffen, which decreases the amount of blood that can flow through the heart - this structural problem can lead to dangerous arrhythmias and even cause cardiac arrest.\n\nIrregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can also lead to SCA, say experts, adding these happen when the electrical signals in the heart are delayed or blocked. Some examples of paediatric arrhythmias include long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In LQTS, which patients suffer fast and chaotic heart rhythm, whereas Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is when the electrical pathways in the heart malfunction.\n\nOther coronary artery abnormalities can also cause SCA among children.\n\nAs Dr Sandeep Gore, Department of Emergency Medicine, Fortis Hospital in Mumbai, was quoted as saying that while cardiac arrests are extremely rare, children can indeed suffer from them, particularly if they have congenital or acquired heart diseases or have experienced chest trauma.\n\nSymptoms to watch out for\n\nUnfortunately, as the name suggest, sudden cardiac arrest in children has no warning signs. However, some of the children who have undergone this experience, say that they complained of shortness of breath, fainting and chest pain.\n\nSadly, people often dismiss the symptoms as minor.\n\nPrevention is better than cure\n\nMedical experts note that with the right precautions, the risks of SCA can be negated. Doctors say it's mandatory that parents take their little ones to a paediatricians for check-ups. Ensure that full examinations and tests are taken to help identify risk factors that may contribute to SCA.\n\nIn case, the child is engaging in sports, ensure that the child undergoes a thorough physical exam. This is another opportunity for their doctor to spot heart problems.\n\nAlso, in case, a child does suffer from SCA, adults should be aware of what to do -- call for help and perform high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, because of the difference in weight and body size, the techniques for performing CPR are different when responding to infants, children, and adults.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legoland_Windsor_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legoland Windsor Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronary artery disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrhythmia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth defect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long QT syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital_of_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heart failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/heart1-2024-05-3a786fbe0dbce1fa1ab6f90317ff41e9.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541294", "eventUri": "eng-9541294", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 653, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

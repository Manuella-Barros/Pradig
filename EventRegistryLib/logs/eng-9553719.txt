Thus, the continuous silencing of journalists and civic actors who hold power accountable undermines the provisions of Sections 22 and 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), which guarantees freedom of the press and freedom of expression, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, the coordinated use of state resources, the mischievous interpretation and hyper-application of laws, especially the Cybercrimes Act of 2015 which has now been amended, and the abuse of power and public institutions are all draconian tactics deployed to further shrink Nigeria's fragile civic space. These tactics have no place in a democracy, where accountability and transparency in governance are essential.\n\nParticularly, the recent abduction and continued detention of Daniel Ojukwu, a journalist with the Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ), exemplifies this disregard for the rule of law and democratic principles. Mr. Ojukwu's fundamental human rights have been blatantly violated.\n\nEven though the Nigeria Police has filed no formal charges, he remains in custody. dditionally, Daniel's unlawful arrest and detention contravenes the combined reading and cumulative effect of Sections 34, 35, and 41 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, which protects his rights to respect for the dignity of his person, personal liberty, and freedom of movement.\n\n\"Daniel Ojukwu's case is the most recent in a recurring trend of similar attacks and harassment aimed at the media and other civic actors by Nigerian law enforcement and security agents. The familiar pattern these attacks seem to take is that the instrumentality of the Nigerian security apparatus is set loose on these individuals as soon as they express views unfavorable to the administration or in the case of journalists, as soon as they publish credible stories that cast the administration in an unflattering light. The expression of opinions, however critical they are of the government, is one of the critical bedrocks of democracy.\n\n\"Consequently, we unequivocally condemn Daniel's abduction and unlawful detention as unconstitutional, illegal, immoral, and unbecoming in a country that claims to practice democracy.

Additionally, Daniel's unlawful arrest and detention contravenes the combined reading and cumulative effect of Sections 34, 35, and 41 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, which protects his rights to respect for the dignity of his person, personal liberty, and freedom of movement.\n\nDaniel Ojukwu's case is the most recent in a recurring trend of similar attacks and harassment aimed at the media and other civic actors by Nigerian law enforcement and security agents. The familiar pattern these attacks seem to take is that the instrumentality of the Nigerian security apparatus is set loose on these individuals as soon as they express views unfavourable to the administration or in the case of journalists, as soon as they publish credible stories that cast the administration in an unflattering light. The expression of opinions, however critical they are of the government, is one of the critical bedrocks of democracy.\n\nConsequently, we unequivocally condemn Daniel's abduction and unlawful detention as unconstitutional, illegal, immoral, and unbecoming in a country that claims to practice democracy. We maintain that for Nigeria to claim its status as the continent's largest democracy, its institutions and law enforcement agencies must uphold established standards and procedures consistent with democratic norms. Until then, Nigeria cannot reconcile the title of the \"largest democracy in Africa\" with the practices and principles reminiscent of a police state.\n\nWe also condemn the incessant use and abuse of the Remand Order process, which is observed to be the new machinery for which the Nigeria Police continuously violates the rights of Nigerian citizens. It is discovered that the Police boast of obtaining a Remand Order without providing such a document for the suspect or his lawyers to see whenever they unlawfully arrest individuals. Even when such orders are obtained, it is usually cloaked with suspicion as the Court from which it is obtained is usually miles away from the police station where the suspect is detained. Even where there is an established Court within a shorter distance of the Police station.\n\nThis is contrary to the rule of law, and it should be of great concern to the Police that it would be seen by the general public as an institution that acts and conducts its duties contrary to the Rule of Law, which is critical to the sustenance of our democracy.\n\nMr Daniel Ojukwu, if accused of a crime, should be promptly charged and given a fair trial under Nigerian law, which presumes innocence until proven guilty. As such, his continued detention is equivalent to an extrajudicial trial and punishment.\n\nIt is in the Inspector General of Police's interest to offer opportunities for the international community to rate the Tinubu administration's compliance and respect for its human rights commitments positively.", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-09-at-13.08.40_4fa8f6d2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553719", "eventUri": "eng-9553719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

But the fact that somebody is a journalist does not exempt him from being questioned for offence committed. If you are a journalist and you commit strong offence, we will arrest you and we will prosecute you like every other citizen.\n\n\"The fact that you are a journalist and you commit an offence does not mean you will not be arrested and you will not be prosecuted. This one, we have looked into the matter and there is no need for this protest.\n\n\"The Force Management Team has taken a lot of things into consideration to release him. We and the press are friends. We are partners in progress.\n\n\"He will be released soon. I'm giving you assurance. From here now, I'm going there.\"\n\nWhen asked to specify where he was going and if he was going to meet the Inspector General of Police, IGP for the release, he said, \"Don't worry, I'm the CP of the FCT, every other office is within the FCT, including the Force CID. So, I'm meeting with the DIG Force CID, that is why I said he would be released soon. I don't need to disclose everything.\"\n\nThe protesters, who had displayed placards with various inscriptions, condemned Ojukwu's continued detention since May 1 on an obscure account that he breached Nigeria's cybercrime law.\n\nMany CSOs including Accountability Lab Nigeria, BudgIT Foundation, Hope Behind Bars Africa, Media Rights Agenda, International Press Centre Rights, Partners West Africa and Centre for Journalism and Development, had earlier protested against the illegal detention of the investigative reporter.\n\nThe Country Director of Accountability Lab, Friday Odeh, who spoke on behalf of the protesting groups, decried the arrest and continued detention of the journalists.\n\nIn a prepared text, tagged: \"Growing Concerns Regarding Press Behind Bars Freedom and Shrinking Civic Space in Nigeria\", which he issued to reporters, the activist called on immediate release of the reporter.\n\n\"Civil society organizations across the country are deeply concerned about the 8rowing cases of attacks on press freedom, and the flagrant abuse of due process and the rule of law by the Nigeria Police under the Inspector General of Police, IGP Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun.\n\n\"Action Group on the Protection of Civic Actors, a Nigerian coalition of media and civil society groups working alongside international allies, sounds the alarm on the recent surge in attacks on press freedom and the silencing of dissent and civic voices.\n\n\"A free press and public participation are fundamental pillars of our democracy.

In Nigeria, press freedom is guaranteed by the constitution, but media practitioners often face challenges such as harassment, intimidation, and censorship from government authorities and security agencies, including the police.\n\nThe role of the Nigeria Police in relation to press freedom is to protect and uphold the rights of journalists to work freely and without fear of reprisal.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, Daniel Ojukwu, a journalist with the Foundation for Investigative Journalism, was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Lagos State, for violating the 2015 Cybercrime Act.\n\nSome media outlets reported that the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Kayode Egbetokun, was behind the arrest of Daniel Ojukwu.\n\nEgbetokun is a media-friendly Inspector General of Police and can never have any hand in the detention of Daniel Ojukwu.\n\nAs a Ph.D. holder, Egbetokun will never attack press freedom or abuse due process or the rule of law.\n\nIn fact, during his meeting with police legal officers on Thursday at the Force Headquarters, the IGP emphasised his administration's policy to bequeath to Nigerians a police force that is rule of law compliant.\n\nThe IGP reiterated the critical role of police legal prosecutors and advisors in ensuring adherence to legal procedures, ethical standards, and human rights principles in all policing operations.\n\nHe is an IGP who believes so much in a free press and public participation, which are fundamental pillars of our democracy. He will never undermine the provisions of Sections 22 and 39 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), which guarantee freedom of the press and freedom of expression, respectively.\n\nWith the above emphasis on the person of the IGP, that doesn't mean that journalists who commit offences won't be arrested and prosecuted like any other citizen of the country, as they are not exempt from arrest and prosecution if they go against the law of the land.\n\nIn the case of Daniel Ojukwu, I am aware that the police obtained a remand order aimed at committing a suspect into custody upon the establishment of a probable cause linking the suspect to the alleged offence.\n\nThe police under IGP Egbetokun have been reliable in ensuring that journalists are able to carry out their duties without interference, harassment, or violence.\n\nHe has continued to investigate any attacks or threats against journalists and hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nIGP Egbetokun understands and respects the vital role that a free press plays in a democratic society through building a positive relationship with the media aimed at fostering mutual understanding and cooperation, leading to better coverage of law enforcement activities and increased transparency in the criminal justice system.\n\nOn a final note, the IGP is a man who understands that a free and independent press is crucial for the functioning of a vibrant democracy, and the Nigeria Police will continue to play a supportive role in ensuring that journalists are able to do their work without fear or hindrance.", "source": {"uri": "opinionnigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Opinion Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "opinion_nigeria@opinionnigeria.com", "name": "Opinion Nigeria",

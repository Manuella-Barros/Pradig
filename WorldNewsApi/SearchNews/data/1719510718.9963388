{"id": 223670012, "title": "Meghan Markle sent 'wide' statement about Harry split rumours with casual gesture", "text": "Before their recent united front on a three-day Invictus Games trip to Nigeria, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were being forced to bat off split rumours which were swirling here in the UK and in the US. Claims suggested that growing financial concerns last year, heightened by losing their lucrative Spotify deal, were adding stress to the couple's life. Sources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were quick and firm to squash the rumours, but speculation rumbled on last year as fans wondered what they would do next - both together and individually. Of course, that's all become clear of late, with the announcement of Meghan's new lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard and Harry active with Invictus interviews and events. But a body language expert believed Meghan used a public appearance to convey a subtle message about her marital status as the rumours continued to circulate that her marriage was on the rocks. The pair were photographed in Santa Barbara, shortly after handing back keys to their Frogmore Cottage residence last summer, and at an Independence Day event with their children, Archie and Lilibet where Meghan was seen sweetly cradling her baby daughter. As we previously reported, according to body language expert Judi James, Meghan's comportment was indicative of the couple's off-camera life. Speaking to The Mirror, she explained: \"Harry and Meghan have been a walking testimony to marital bliss. \"Their face-gazing looks of mutual adoration and their inability to not touch, hug, stroke or clasp hands with each other for longer than a few moments has always proved that however controversial their comments, their love was an ongoing success story. \"Their most recent appearances together show them caught in candid moments. The car photos seem to suggest that their hand-holding ritual is still very much a part of their relationship (although the hands themselves are hidden, their arm positioning implies a clasp).\" \"Her broad smile when she's with Harry appears to be a statement, a social gesture to reassure fans that her life remains joyful and perfect, although his expression seems slightly more subdued. \"On July 4, the couple looks just like any other family with their children. Meghan is clearly making the experience enjoyable for Lilibet, even going as far as kneeling on one knee in light-coloured trousers to encourage her daughter to enjoy the parade. This appears to be a group outing though, with Harry standing and leaning in to chat with someone else. \"It's the sort of thing most families do, it only appears different for Harry and Meghan because we're accustomed to seeing them in blissful cuddle-bundles rather than even a few feet apart.\" Meanwhile, Royal author Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight that she believed the couple remained \"very close\". She stated: \"My experience with Harry and Meghan - whenever I've been with them as a couple, who are very, very close - [have] a sort of spark between them that always struck me as being very authentic. \"I think it was very notable that in the run-up to the launch of his [Harry's] autobiography, he had all the publicity and Meghan was noticeable by her absence. \"And that was really the first time we've seen a divide between them because up until then they've very much been a partnership, and at this crucial moment where Harry's doing the boldest and possibly bravest thing of his life, she's not there for him. \"And that has continued and led to more rumours of a split, of a split being on the horizon - and yet, there is no evidence. They're presenting a very united front.\" A source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex hit back at speculations there was trouble in paradise, as they told Page Six that rumours of a break up were untrue. \"It's not true. It's literally made up,\" the insider told the publication. Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

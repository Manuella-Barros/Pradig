Even as a special Pocso court sentenced the accused to 20-year rigorous imprisonment on Thursday, the children have another battle to fight \u2014 HIV.\u201cSince the accused stated in court that he is HIV+, the children were also tested. Results show they too are HIV+,\u201d said an official associated with the investigation. While the two minor girls \u2014 aged 10 and 14 \u2014 are living in a home in the city, the seven-year-old boy has been put in another facility.\u201cMedical help is being extended to all four \u2014 the accu sed and the survivors,\u201d the official added.111355251The crime first came to light two years ago when the survivors shared the traumatic ordeal with their neighbour, a 46-year-old woman. Their mother had been away for a fu neral and returned only after amonth. The neighbour offered shelter to the children briefly but had to give up when the accused fought with her and forcibly took the kids away. When the minors came to her again, she mustered the courage and took them to the police station. Since then, she has stood by them like a rock and helped them sail through this tough legal battle.\u201cI am a single woman and have three daughters. I decided to help the children purely on humanitarian grounds. The man might have married their mother, but that does not give him the right to do anything with them,\u201d said the woman, who makes a living selling scrap.Testimony of kids, neighbour nailed accusedShe said the conviction made her feel relieved.During trial, accused tried to defend himself saying he was falsely implicated in the case because of financial issues with the mother of the kids. He alleged the neighbour, too, held a grudge against him as he stopped children from collecting scrap with her.The special Pocso court, however, observed that he failed to prove these claims. \u201cIt is clear that they (the contents of the complaint) clearly corroborate her (neighbour\u2019s) version before the court,\u201d the court noted, and ruled that \u201cthe evidence of the children is consistent and cogent throughout and their statements before the police, judicial officer are very much supporting the case of the prosecution and evidence before the court\u201d.Even as accused pleaded for leniency stating that he was suffering from HIV, the court said, \u201cConsidering the nature of the offence, this court is not inclined to apply the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act\u201d.", "summary": "", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/after-fighting-rapist-stepdad-3-minor-siblings-now-battle-hiv/articleshow/111352651.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-72,width-1280,height-720,msid-111355297/111355297.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:14:28", "author": "Pinto Deepak", "authors": ["Pinto Deepak"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.297}

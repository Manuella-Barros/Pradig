{"id": 227483622, "title": "Kenny Dalglish rinses 'unacceptable' Rangers trope as Celtic legend names Philippe Clement's \u00a340m problem", "text": "Kenny Dalglish has called out Rangers over their \"totally unac-cept-able\" record against Celtic in the last three years - and warned it won't get any easier with the Hoops' guarantee of Champions League football. Philippe Clement has yet to claim a victory over Celtic since stepping into the Ibrox hot seat with a winless run against the Hoops - including in the Scottish Cup final - piling the misery on for Rangers fans last term. And the record doesn't make much better reading for the Ibrox diehards in the last three seasons with the Light Blues' holding just two wins over their rivals. In August 2021, Steven Gerrard led Rangers to a 1-0 win over Ange Postecoglou's Celtic - consigning the Australian to defeat in his first Old Firm derby. In May 2023, Michael Beale would earn his first Old Firm victory at the fifth attempt in a 3-0 win - but Celtic had already been crowned Scottish Premiership champion at that stage. And Dalglish insists that record is not \"good enough\" for Rangers, but reckons they may not be able to splash the cash to catch their rivals with Celtic guaranteed a \u00a340million jackpot from the group stage - while Clement must navigate the playoff rounds. Writing for the Sunday Post, Dalglish said: \"Brendan Rodgers and his squad were worthy win-ners. When it mattered, they pro-duced the goods. \"They defeated Rangers four times and drew with them once. It was a bril-liant record. Rangers, on the other hand, need to find a way to beat their biggest rivals. \"From their point of view, their res-ults in Old Firm matches in the last three years have been totally unac-cept-able. Sure, they can point to the fact all their defeats came by a single goal. They also played well in stages in the Scot-tish Cup final last week and had Celtic pinned back for spells. \"But since when was that good enough or accept-able for a club of that size with its suc-cess rate? The onus is now on Phil-ippe Clem-ent to find a way. And he\u2019ll need to do it quickly. There is no room for more defeats. \"We will wait and see what kind of budget there is for him to work with, but there will not be a bot-tom-less pit. The sooner they get play-ers in, the bet-ter. They need to recruit some qual-ity play-ers and they also need to get more out of the cur-rent group, cer-tainly from the ones still there come the start of August. \"That\u2019s also the month their Cham-pi-ons League qual-i-fi-ers start and what a boost it would be if they could secure the \u00a340 mil-lion riches from that. It\u2019s a big ask but it is not insur-mount-able to get through the two rounds. \"Across the city, there is cer-tainty about what they can do in the trans-fer mar-ket and that makes things so much clearer. For Brendan and the hier-archy to know what they have to work with will make it much more com-fort-ing. \"There could still be a scen-ario that happened last sum-mer with Jota, when a bid from Saudi Ara-bia came out of the blue and he was away for \u00a325m. But it looks as though Celtic are in a good pos-i-tion to react to any-thing that may come, such as a huge bid for Matt O\u2019Riley.\"", "summary": "The Belgian boss faces a big turnover in players this summer as the Light Blues aim to dethrone Celtic.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kenny-dalglish-rinses-unacceptable-rangers-32942584", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article32942681.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-02-at-124753.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:03:27", "author": "Mark Pirie", "authors": ["Mark Pirie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.278}

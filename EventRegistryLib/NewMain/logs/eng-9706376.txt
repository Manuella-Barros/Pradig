AP\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Russia on July 8-9 and hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The visit was first announced by Russian officials last month, but the dates have not been previously disclosed.\n\nRussia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi's importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies that shut most Western markets for Russian exports.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia's action in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement.\n\nThe partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with India's main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine.\n\nModi on Thursday skipped the summit of a security grouping created by Moscow and Beijing to counter Western alliances.\n\nModi sent his foreign minister to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at its annual meeting in Kazakhstan's capital of Astana. The meeting is being attended by Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIndian media reports speculated that the recently reelected Modi was busy with the Parliament session last week.\n\nModi last visited Russia in 2019 for an economic forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. He last traveled to Moscow in 2015. Putin last met with Modi in September 2022 at a summit of the SCO in Uzbekistan. In 2021, Putin also traveled to New Delhi and held talks with the Indian leader.\n\nTensions between Beijing and New Delhi have continued since a confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border in which rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian troops and four Chinese soldiers were killed.\n\nAfter his reelection to a third straight term. Modi attended the G7 meeting in Italy's Apulia region last month and addressed artificial intelligence, energy, and regional issues in Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was the source of about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms.\n\nIndia bought its first aircraft carrier , INS Vikramaditya, from Russia in 2004. It had served in the former Soviet Union and later in the Russian navy.\n\nWith the Russian supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been reducing its dependency on Russian arms and diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy.

The visit was first announced by Russian officials last month, but the dates have not been previously disclosed.\n\nRussia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi's importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies that shut most Western markets for Russian exports.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership, India has avoided condemning Russia's action in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement.\n\nThe partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with India's main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine.\n\nModi on Thursday skipped the summit of a security grouping created by Moscow and Beijing to counter Western alliances.\n\nModi sent his foreign minister to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at its annual meeting in Kazakhstan's capital of Astana. The meeting is being attended by Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIndian media reports speculated that the recently reelected Modi was busy with the Parliament session last week.\n\nModi last visited Russia in 2019 for an economic forum in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. He last traveled to Moscow in 2015. Putin last met with Modi in September 2022 at a summit of the SCO in Uzbekistan. In 2021, Putin also traveled to New Delhi and held talks with the Indian leader.\n\nTensions between Beijing and New Delhi have continued since a confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border in which rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian troops and four Chinese soldiers were killed.\n\nAfter his reelection to a third straight term. Modi attended the G7 meeting in Italy's Apulia region last month and addressed artificial intelligence, energy, and regional issues in Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was the source of about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms.\n\nIndia bought its first aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, from Russia in 2004. It had served in the former Soviet Union and later in the Russian navy.\n\nWith the Russian supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been reducing its dependency on Russian arms and diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He last travelled to Moscow in 2015.\n\nThe Indian and Russian leaders last met in September 2022 at a summit of the SCO in Uzbekistan. In 2021, Mr Putin also travelled to New Delhi and held talks with the Indian leader.\n\nTensions between Beijing and New Delhi have continued since a confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border in which rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists, where at least 20 Indian troops and four Chinese soldiers were killed.\n\nAfter his re-election to a third straight term, Mr Modi attended the G7 meeting in Italy's Apulia region last month and addressed artificial intelligence, energy, and regional issues in Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was the source of about 70 per cent of Indian army weapons, 80 per cent of its air force systems and 85 per cent of its navy platforms.\n\nIndia bought its first aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, from Russia in 2004. It had served in the former Soviet Union and later in the Russian navy.\n\nWith the Russian supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been reducing its dependency on Russian arms and diversifying its defence procurements, buying more from the US, Israel, France and Italy.\n\nRussia's vast state-owned Rostec corporation said on Thursday its' weapons export unit had organised the production in India of armour-piercing rounds for Russian-made battle tanks.\n\nThe \"Mango\" projectiles that will be made in India are designed to be fired from the guns of T-72 and T-90 tanks which India's land forces use, Rostec said in a statement.\n\n\"The rounds allow you to hit modern tanks equipped with combined protection. Various modifications of these combat vehicles are in service with India.\"\n\nRostec said it also had plans to localise the production of gunpowder in India as part of the Indian government's drive to have more foreign goods made in India.\n\nMoscow has long supplied the Indian military with equipment.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

As Prime Minister Modi prepares for talks with Putin, India wants to stay neutral in the Ukraine war and further boost trade with Russia.\n\nIndia took a lot of flak in the West for increasing imports of Russian fossil fuels in the face of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The world's third-largest oil importer saw deliveries from Russia jump tenfold in 2022 and double again last year, thanks to heavy price discounts. India's coal imports from Russia rose threefold over the same two-year period.\n\nDespite accusations of funding Putin's war machine, New Delhi has justified the increase by citing India's traditional \"stable and friendly\" ties with Moscow and its heavy reliance on imported oil.\n\nAs Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week, Putin will be looking to further boost trade with the South Asian power to shore up Russia's commodity-dependent economy and lessen the impact of Western sanctions over the Ukraine war.\n\nWhen announcing the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said as well as working together on global and regional security issues, there was \"mutual political will\" to boost trade and economic cooperation.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, must tread a delicate path as it aims to maintain strong links with the West, seek new trade links with Moscow and retain a neutral position over the conflict.\n\nDW looks at the current state of India-Russia trade ties and what the two leaders could agree on next.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union and India built a strategic partnership for defense and trade that continued after the end of communism. In 2000, Putin, then Russia's prime minister, signed a new declaration of cooperation with New Delhi.\n\nIndia is a major market for the Russian defense industry -- until recently its largest. During the past two decades, Moscow supplied 65% of India's weapons purchases, totaling more than $60 billion (\u20ac55.8 billion), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nAfter Russian forces invaded Ukraine, Moscow sought to deepen its relations with India and China as a counterweight to the West. The Kremlin offered New Delhi huge discounts on oil, coal and fertilizer deliveries to boost the country's finances to fight the war.\n\nAs a result, India emerged as a major export market for Russian fossil fuels in search of new destinations in the wake of Western sanctions. In April, for example, Russian crude oil deliveries to India surged to a new record of 2.1 million barrels per day (b/d), according to S&P Global.\n\nBilateral trade between the two countries reached a record high of nearly $65.7 billion last year, figures from India's Department of Commerce showed. Trade is, however, massively stacked in Russia's favor, with India importing $61.4 billion worth of goods, including oil, fertilizers, precious stones and metals.\n\n\"For long, we have looked at Russia from a political or security perspective,\" Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said at an industry conference in May. \"As that country turns eastwards, fresh economic opportunities are presenting themselves ... the spike in our trade and new areas of cooperation should not be regarded as a temporary phenomenon.\"\n\nWhile the West limited its criticism of India over the cheap oil deal with Russia, New Dehli's historic reliance on Moscow for weapons is a major concern for the US and Europe.\n\n\"New Delhi has demonstrated a nuanced approach to navigating the Russia-Ukraine conflict, staying on good terms with Moscow and the West,\" Dr Aleksei Zakharov, a researcher on Indian foreign policy at the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), wrote in a paper last month.\n\nZakharov wrote of \"structural challenges\" that he said \"appear to still prevent the two sides from reinvigorating the economic ties, adding that the defense cooperation between Russia and India is currently \"in a state of limbo,\" partly as the Ukraine war and Western sanctions have hobbled Russia's arms sector.\n\nIndia had several negative experiences in earlier deals with Russia's arms industry. A 2004 deal to buy a Soviet-era aircraft carrier, upgraded and retrofitted by Russia, was criticized over long delays and a doubling of costs.\n\nIn 2013, the explosion and sinking of a Russian-built submarine, which killed 18 crew members, further pressured India's leaders on their defense cooperation with Moscow.\n\nThe Indian military is currently awaiting two of five S-400 air defense systems and Russian-made frigates that Russia agreed to supply as part of 2018 deals, local media reported in April.\n\nWhile India remained the leading destination of arms transfers from Moscow between 2017 and 2022, Russia's share of defense exports to the South Asian country dropped from 65% to 36% during the same period, SIPRI data showed,\n\nFrench and German arms suppliers have benefitted from New Delhi's change of strategy, amid reticence among Indian policymakers to break Western sanctions on Moscow by signing new deals with the Kremlin.\n\nModi's visit to Moscow -- his second overseas trip after reelection earlier this month -- is a sign of the importance India still places on relations with the Kremlin. As a growing world power, New Delhi is keen to prioritize its own strategic interests while balancing relations with the West, Russia and China.\n\nWhile New Delhi has called for \"dialogue and diplomacy\" to end the Ukraine war, at the recent Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland, India's representative didn't sign a joint communique calling for Ukraine's territorial integrity to be respected in any peace agreement.\n\n\"On the surface, it may seem that India's neutrality [in the Ukraine war] has allowed the strengthening of bilateral ties with Moscow,\" said Zahkarov in his recent paper. \"However, a closer look suggests that India has become more cautious in its interactions with Russia ... [so] maintaining dialogue and hedging bets will likely be more important for both sides than striking new deals.\"\n\nAlthough new pacts to buy Russian weapons may be limited, Modi's \"Made in India\" initiative, which aims to promote the country as a manufacturing hub, could see Russia provide more raw materials and parts for domestic Indian arms production.\n\nRussia is also keen to expand the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a road, sea and rail project that connects Russia to India via Iran. Russia shipped the first tranche of coal through the INSTC last month.\n\nThe project has been in the works for over two decades and due to the constraints that Russia is facing from Western sanctions, INSTC is now a key trade priority for the Kremlin.\n\nCompletion of another project that has taken on new urgency is the Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor. First proposed in 2019, the 10,300-kilometer (5,600-nautical mile) sea route from Russia's Far East could help secure flows of Russian energy and other raw materials to India.\n\nThe proposed corridor is expected to reduce shipping times from 40 to 24 days, compared with the existing route through the Suez Canal.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stockholm International Peace Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

For instance, India has been buying Russian oil at lower prices despite objections from western countries during the Ukraine conflict. Modi is skipping the 2024 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in Kazakhstan, which Putin will attend and it is unclear if he will go to the BRICS summit in Moscow later this year.\n\nHis visit to Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war will send important messages and could help resolve some issues. To begin with, this will be Modi's first visit to Russia in five years. It is happening when the Russian president has few reliable allies or friends. Since 2000, India and Russia have held annual summits, each country hosting in turn. However, these meetings have not happened in recent years.\n\nIn 2021, Putin visited New Delhi. But, on February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which severely damaged Russia's relationships with western countries. Although Modi met Putin in 2022, it was not in Moscow. They met during the SCO meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. At that meeting, Modi famously told Putin, \"This is not an era of war.\"\n\nNew Delhi and Moscow have maintained a strong relationship for many years, especially since India and the former Soviet Union signed the 'Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation' in 1971. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, they had to redefine their relationship.\n\nThe yearly summits have been important for maintaining the long-standing relationship between New Delhi and Moscow in a changing world. Defence and energy have been central to this renewed partnership. However, the relationship is not as strong as it was before because a more economically powerful India is now looking more to the West for technology and investments.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has been getting closer to China, India's strategic rival, especially after facing issues with the West following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This shift towards China is a matter of concern for India, which is currently dealing with a tense border situation with China. In 2022, just days before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping had declared a \"friendship without limits\", which greatly upset New Delhi.\n\nGiven this situation, it is crucial to engage Russia in political discussions and work on strengthening economic ties. Many of India's military equipment are still from Soviet or Russian sources and require spare parts. For instance, most of the Indian Air Force's fighter jets are from Russia. While India is starting to buy defence equipment from other countries, it still relies on Russia for important spare parts and the remaining S-400 air defence system units. India is also seeking replacements for some of its Sukhoi fighter jets.\n\nAlthough Russia was once a reliable defence partner, New Delhi is now concerned that Russia might share sensitive technology with China or delay the supply of spare parts if conflicts arise with China or Pakistan. Therefore, maintaining a balance between its relationships with Russia and the West has been crucial for New Delhi.\n\nSecond, maintaining good relations with Russia could be beneficial if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House after the November elections. Putin has a tense relationship with the Biden administration, but had a friendly rapport with Trump in the past. There is no sign that this will change if Trump gets a second term. After last week's presidential debate between Biden and Trump, Trump's chances of winning have improved.\n\nThird, Putin's recent visit to North Korea led to a mutual defence pact. This may worry New Delhi, as India has always been concerned about defence ties between Pakistan and North Korea. A 2016 article in The Diplomat explains how this cooperation started and developed. Pakistan received long-range missiles from North Korea in exchange for nuclear technology. The potential transfer of advanced defence and sensitive space technology to Pakistan through North Korea could be problematic for India.\n\nFourth, India and Russia are about to sign a logistics support agreement that will help India extend its naval reach even to the Arctic and grant India access to Russian naval bases there. Similar agreements with Japan, Australia and the US are already allowing Indian ships to travel longer routes with access to ports in these countries. The region has been gaining global attention with new shipping routes opening up.\n\nFifth, Modi could be delivering a message from the West to Putin during this visit. Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has mentioned several times that New Delhi has acted as a messenger between the two sides and helped secure the 2022 Black Sea Grain Initiative backed by the UN and Turkey, which facilitated safe grain exports from Ukraine's Black Sea ports during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russia's cooperation was vital, as it agreed to allow safe passage of these vessels through the conflict zone.\n\nSince India has connections with both sides, New Delhi might help bring the warring parties in the Ukraine conflict to the negotiating table. If Trump wins the forthcoming US elections in November, there is a chance that US support for Ukraine may decrease. Europe, meanwhile, appears not ready to handle the responsibility alone, according to The Diplomat. So, this could be a good moment for India to step in and act as a peacemaker.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Grain_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Grain Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

We cooperate in so many areas, and I think that will be a substantive conversation on the whole range of issues that our countries cooperate on,\" Nebenzia had said.\n\nWhen asked what he expects will be achieved from the visit, Nebenzia said, \"I expect Russian-Indian relations to blossom even better.\"\n\nSignificance of the visit\n\nThis will be Modi's first visit to Russia after it attacked Ukraine in February 2022, and is significant given India's tactful diplomacy on ties with Moscow and the West in the backdrop of their hostility.\n\nModi had last visited Russia in 2019, when he had gone to Vladivostok for the 20th India-Russia Annual Summit.\n\nOver the last two years, New Delhi has maintained a diplomatic balancing act between Russia and Ukraine. While it has not explicitly condemned the Russian invasion, it has called for an international probe into the Bucha massacre and has expressed concern over nuclear threats issued by Russian leaders. At the UN Security Council, India has taken a nuanced position and abstained from voting against Russia in several resolutions.\n\nIndia has strategic ties with Moscow and a strong dependence on Russia for defence supplies. Ever since the war began, India has also been buying Russian oil at discounted prices to cushion the inflationary impact of rising oil prices.\n\nThe last in-person bilateral meeting between the two leaders took place in Samarkand, Uzbekistan on the sidelines of the SCO Summit in September 2022. This was the time, when Modi had told Putin that \"this is not the era of war\" -- a line later used in the formulation at the G20 summit in Bali in November 2022 and by other western leaders and interlocutors to press on Russia to end the war.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Nebenzya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vasily Nebenzya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladivostok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vladivostok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucha_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bucha massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_G20_Bali_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 G20 Bali summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Samarkand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Putin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706376", "eventUri": "eng-9706376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

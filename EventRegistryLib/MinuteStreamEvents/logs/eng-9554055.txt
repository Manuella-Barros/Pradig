Carried out by a pair of Salford gangsters, it resulted in a father and son being brutally attacked and \u00a31m worth of cocaine stolen, and set off a chain of events leading to the downfall of gangland leader Vincent Coggins.\n\nCoggins was the head of an organised crime group (OCG) involved in distributing large quantities of cocaine and heroin across the UK. Raised in Knowsley's Cantril Farm during the 70s and 80s, Coggins and his brother Francis built their formidable drug gang from scratch, creating a cartel that rivalled criminal factions from Ireland, Eastern Europe and South America, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nREAD NEXT: Three men in Greater Manchester arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences\n\nThe targeted attack, conducted by rival gangsters who knew whose drugs were stashed there, saw the homeowner and his son severely assaulted and huge amounts of cocaine stolen. Vincent Coggins, along with his criminal associates including his right-hand man Edward Jarvis, resolved to identify who had taken them.\n\nBut Vincent Coggins did not just want to find them and get his drugs back. He also expressed a desire to kill them. Little did he and his criminal associates know that their every move was being monitored by the authorities following the hack of the EncroChat network.\n\nThis would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall and Vincent Coggins' arrest and conviction. Now, after nearly four years of extensive reporting restrictions that have prevented the media from being able to identify those involved in the gang, the ECHO has revealed all following the conclusion of Jarvis' trial at Manchester Crown Court.\n\nThe Coggins brothers, Jarvis and a number of their associates were career criminals who would turn their hand to whatever paid. But during the drugs boom of the 1990s, they saw the opportunity to get rich quick, moving to the Costa del Sol to establish an organised syndicate that smuggled cocaine from South America, through Europe and into the UK. Once there, the gang, known in the criminal world as the Huyton Firm, had established supply networks that spread from Plymouth to Scotland.\n\nThe amounts of class A drugs they dealt in resulted in extreme wealth. A court sentencing for Paul Fitzsimmons, a criminal associate who \"answered directly to Francis Coggins,\" previously heard the OCG's overall involvement in class A drugs over a three-month period during 2020 was calculated at 148 kg of cocaine and 248 kg of heroin. However, the true amount could be significantly higher.\n\nThe ECHO understands that the Coggins firm imported their illicit cargo through the Port of Liverpool. Analysis of messages saw the group referring to workers at the port watching containers to see whether they attracted attention from port agency authorities. It's likely that these supply routes that opened up the Coggins' gang to receive shipments from anywhere in the world were a driving force in allowing the gang to build international power and reputation. Investigating police officers told the ECHO no port workers were identified or investigated as part of their operation.\n\nInvestigators do not know exactly when the gang started to use the encrypted messaging service platform EncroChat. The network was favoured by high-profile criminals because it was believed at the time to be totally secure. Criminal organisations used the expensive phones, which cost between \u00a31,200 and \u00a31,500 for a six-month contract, to organise their criminal activities without fear of their messages ever being seen by law enforcement.\n\nUsing the EncroChat network, Coggins and his associates arranged and carried out multiple deals involving huge sums of drugs and cash. They communicated with other gangs both in Merseyside and further afield, overseeing supply lines. They thought their messages were going secret, but little did they know police had obtained access to EncroChat after French and Dutch authorities had hacked into the network in early April 2020.\n\nPolice were now monitoring their every move. Each user was assigned a unique \"handle\" on the EncroChat network, and through careful monitoring of each message, investigating officers were able to identify the gang members. At the top was Vincent Coggins, who went by the handle \"moonlitboat\". Under him were Michael Earle and Jarvis, who went by the handles \"bladehedge\" and \"Softherb\" respectively, while associate Paul Woodford used the handle \"kingwasp\".\n\nOther associates, including Dean Borrows, Fitzsimmons, Darren Tierney and Kevin Rimmer, were also linked to the handles \"Olivescooter,\" \"Northknee\", \"Scalpstaff\" and \"Sappystag\" through their disclosure of personal information. Two other handles - \"tallcanine\" and \"mixedjet\" featured prominently in the messages between Vincent Coggins, Jarvis, Earle and Woodford.\n\nAlex Leach KC, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of trials relating to the gang, told Manchester Crown Court during the trial of Jarvis: \"The chat reveals that the user of both handles was based in Amsterdam during this period and the evidence strongly suggests that he was Vincent Coggins' brother Francis.\n\n\"He played an important and authoritative role within the group: Jarvis deferred to him on most matters and he often discussed important strategic decisions with his brother Vincent.\" Francis Coggins has not yet been apprehended in relation to the investigation.\n\nMessages between the Coggins brothers and Jarvis revealed the gang discussing the sales of \"tops\" (cocaine) and \"botts\" (heroin). The EncroChat messages showed the gang discussing international shipments and deals, while also advertising their \"belter\" product to buyers in Scotland, South Wales and elsewhere. But the gang also shared personal information about each other that helped the police's investigation.\n\nOn one occasion, on May 11 2020, Jarvis and Vincent Coggins discussed making a trip to Costco together. Jarvis used his UK mobile phone to connect to a mast that provided coverage to Costco. Vincent Coggins, who was a member at Costco, conducted two transactions where frozen crispy duck was purchased. Later that evening, the pair, using their EncroChat handles to discuss if the duck could be cooked from frozen or if it had to be defrosted.\n\nHowever, although subordinate roles were played by a number of conspirators, above all of them were the Coggins - Francis in Amsterdam and Vincent, referred to in some messages as \"the headmaster,\" at home in Cantril Farm, now known as Stockbridge Village. And when the stash house, minded by Paul Glynn, was robbed and 30 kilos of cocaine was stolen, it was Vincent Coggins' loss and it was he who controlled the response to taking it back.\n\nCCTV footage from a neighbour's home on Croxdale Road West showed the violent attack. Just before 9.30am, a white van pulled up outside the stash house and four men got out, three wearing dark clothes and balaclavas while a fourth posed as a delivery man. They rushed towards the house where they were met by a stunned dad and son, launching into a savage attack that resulted in Paul Glynn almost losing an arm after it was slashed down to the bone. Images later shared by the police showed huge blood splatters sprayed across the front entrance to the house.\n\nPolice received a call from Paul Glynn's son Kenny which said \"these lads just came into the house and started stabbing me dad and there's blood everywhere\". But by that time, and unknown to the Glynn's until later, their attackers had left the scene with a bag containing \u00a31m worth of cocaine.\n\nThe first the rest of the gang heard about the robbery was when Francis Coggins saw a report in the ECHO about the stabbing. And by 7.41pm that night, Vincent Coggins knew the drugs were gone. It was here that the ruthlessness of the Coggins brothers was truly shown. Without a definitive name, Vincent Coggins' suspicions first fell on Kenny Glynn. Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis, his eyes and ears on the investigation, \"Got to be the son, f*** it, I kill him.\"\n\nIn the following days Vincent Coggins directed his troops to find those responsible. After obtaining a CCTV video, he directed Jarvis and Fitzsimmons to distribute it across the underworld for help. And when he had a name, he started to put in place a plan of action. He messaged Earle \"M8 can you sort pineapple tonight\" - a term used to refer to a hand grenade, while Woodford offered to buy a firearm and ammunition on Vincent Coggins' behalf.\n\nHis target was Brian Maxwell, a professional drug dealer who later used the EncroChat phone network to source weapons including semi-automatic AR-15 rifles and an AK47 to protect himself from attack. Even when presented with potential evidence that Maxwell Jr could not have been involved in the robbery because he had CCTV of him at home all day and advised to leave it until the following day, Vincent Coggins refused. He messaged Earle \"No m8 tonight now got to be done we don't mess round\". It was only the failure in delivering the grenade to the attacker that halted the proceeding for another day.\n\nVincent Coggins reported to Earle his intention at approaching Brian Maxwell's dad, Brian Maxwell Sr, with an ultimatum. Return the drugs or the money, or he would pay. Having monitored the messages, the police took their first steps to disrupt Vincent Coggins' plans. On May 27 they visited Brian Maxwell Jr's home and issued him with a threat to life notice, also known as an Osman warning.\n\nArmed police also visited an address linked to Vincent Coggins to issue a disruption notice - a warning not to engage in any criminal activity. Undeterred, he continued to set in motion plans to kill Brian Maxwell Jr, as well as two other men he believed were involved - Michael Eves and Iyobosa 'Bosa' Igbinovia. On May 28 Jarvis messaged Vincent Coggins alleged evidence that the pair considered incriminating the three men even further in the robbery.\n\nAn EncroChat message at around 2.30pm that day said: \"..he told me they were all out together Maxwell boser eves Saturday afternoon til Sunday for anniversary drink...so Maxwell saying he got CCTV of himself not leaving house on Saturday is a f***ing lie\". Later that day Coggins messaged Fitzsimmons saying \"they all getting it\".\n\nThe Maxwells communicated with Vincent Coggins, Earle and Jarvis through a third party, a man who is still due to appear before the courts so can't be identified. Fearing an attack on his son was imminent, Maxwell Sr sent a proposal to the gang.\n\nHe knew his son had not committed the robbery but understanding the threat said \"me solution involves me and me alone paying the bill and then its me that's been robbed, I'd rather have him than the money...and it wont be in grip coz I haven't got it any more than he has...then its down to me to find out who done it...any money I've got means f*** all if he dead\".\n\nMaxwell Sr offered around \u00a31,360,000 to Vincent Coggins, split into cash and the sale of land and a house. Vincent Coggins accepted the offer. But a chilling message to Earle later the same day showed it was just a temporary peace. \"F*** me still going to kill them all but can take time now leave dad alone\", he wrote.\n\nPolice disruption continued despite the movements of the gang. Police attended Maxwell Sr's home and gave him an Osman warning, while Earle was issued a disruption notice. Unnerved by the police attention, Earle appeared to back out. However, Vincent Coggins was undeterred. He wrote back: \"Am staying till I've got every penny an at least done of one of the c****\". On June 3, Maxwell Sr signed over the money, the land and the house.\n\nWith police sniffing around his business, Vincent Coggins asked Woodford to use his police contact, known as \"the computer man\", to get copies of what was being said about him on the Police National Computer database. The contact told them there were new updates to Vincent Coggins profile, but they had not been able to take a photo. These were arranged through another EncroChat contact, Michael Burns, who used the handle MillionDolla.\n\nMerseyside Police later told the ECHO an anti-corruption team reviewed the messages and an extensive search of force systems in relation to those individuals was carried out to identify if there was any unauthorised access to information in relation to them and to identify any potential suspect. A spokesperson for the force said: \"A number of individuals were identified as having had access for a legitimate policing purpose, including staff from other forces, and no corruption was identified.\"\n\nOn June 13 2020, EncroChat administrators sent all users the message that the domain had been compromised and they could no longer guarantee the security of the devices. They advised users to power off and to physically dispose of their devices.\n\nThree days later, Vincent Coggins, Woodford, Earle and Jarvis were all arrested by the police. The Maxwells were arrested several months later. During his court sentencing, Maxwell Jr's defence said the police operation to disrupt the hand grenade attack \"had probably saved his life\".\n\nWhen the stash house was first robbed, Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis \"no way manks f***er local\", referring to the fact he could not believe a Manchester gang would be brave enough to come down the M56 carry out the raid. However, further examinations of the EncroChat network led investigators to the rival crime group behind the raid.\n\nSalford gangsters Jason and Craig Cox had targeted the stash house in collaboration with Liverpool career criminal Richard Caswell. The \"tight knit\" Cox crime gang were involved in large scale drug dealing, but in a bid to step up in the underworld, Jason Cox decided to join forces with Caswell, a well-known figure previously linked to a spate of car bombings across the city in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAfter a number of surveillance trips to scope out the address, they raided the house, making off with \u00a31m of cocaine which Jason Cox split with Caswell. Jason Cox would go on to sell his shares to notorious drug dealer Leon Atkinson - an associate of both police killer Dale Cregan and Merseyside-based suppliers the Cassidy brothers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the robbery, Jason Cox said in EncroChat messages how he had got cocaine from \"the biggest firm in Liverpool\". But he also realised the threat he now faced. Messages showed he enquired about renting a new flat, and eventually fled with his brother Lee to Spain. Caswell was playing an even more dangerous game.\n\nAs Coggins' firm desperately tried to work out who had ripped them off, they asked him directly if he had information regarding the raid. Caswell played dumb and said he would ask around, but passed on what they had told him to Jason Cox. The fall-out when the identities of the robbers was seismic in the underworld.\n\nArson attacks at properties linked to the Cox family in Salford were reported to Greater Manchester Police, while Caswell was slashed in HMP Manchester. A spokesperson for the Manchester force said they had issued a number of Osman warnings to the Cox family and their associates, and was working with the prison service after Jason Cox said he would have to \"look over his shoulder\" for the rest of his life. The Cox brothers, Caswell and \"foot soldier\" Ben Monks-Gorton, who posed as the delivery driver, were all jailed last year.\n\nCoggins and his associates answered no comment in their interviews. But by this time, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU), who were investigating the gang, had gathered thousands of messages that tied the Coggins' operation together. The arrests of Coggins and his potentially deadly associates marked the first EncroChat arrests made by the NWROCU - codenamed Operation SubZero - and the first time the force's EncroChat evidence would have to stand up in court.\n\nThose sentenced as part of Operation SubZero were:\n\nVincent Coggins, 58, of Woodpecker Close, West Derby, who was jailed for 28 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nPaul Woodford, 58, of Marl Road, Kirkby, was jailed for 24 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nMichael Earle, 48, of Wallace Drive, Huyton, was jailed for 11 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nDarren Tierney, 46, of Chatham Street, Stockport, was jailed for 12 years and nine months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Fitzsimmons, 60, of Birch Tree Court, West Derby, was jailed for 12 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nKevin Rimmer, 57, of Blacklow Brow, Huyton, was jailed for 16 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nDean Borrows, 39, of Ledson Grove, Aughton, was jailed for 14 years and three months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Glynn, 59, of Croxdale Road West, West Derby, was jailed for 11 years and two months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs\n\nRobert Jarvis, 59, of Breckside Park, Anfield, is due to be sentenced after he was found guilty at trial for conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.", "source":

Coggins and his brother Francis, brought up in Knowsley's Cantril Farm in the 1970s and 80s, built their powerful drug gang from nothing into a bona fide cartel that rivalled criminal factions from Ireland, Eastern Europe and South America.\n\nSources previously told the ECHO that the pair avoided disputes and silly fall outs wherever possible. But they also were not afraid of ordering devastating violence to be carried out on anyone who compromised their interests. On the morning of Saturday, May 23 2020, a violent armed robbery was carried out at a house on Croxdale Road West, West Derby.\n\nREAD MORE: Burglar who broke into house and stole dog says he was on 'rescue mission'\n\nREAD MORE: A dark chapter in Liverpool's history is coming to an end\n\nThe targeted attack, conducted by rival gangsters who knew whose drugs were stashed there, saw the homeowner and his son severely assaulted and huge amounts of cocaine stolen. Vincent Coggins, along with his criminal associates including his right-hand man Edward Jarvis, resolved to identify who had taken them.\n\nBut Vincent Coggins did not just want to find them and get his drugs back. He also expressed a desire to kill them. Little did he and his criminal associates know that their every move was being monitored by the authorities following the hack of the EncroChat network.\n\nThis would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall and Vincent Coggins' arrest and conviction. Now, after nearly four years of extensive reporting restrictions that have prevented the media from being able to identify those involved in the gang, the ECHO can reveal all following the conclusion of Jarvis' trial at Manchester Crown Court.\n\nThe Coggins brothers, Jarvis and a number of their associates were career criminals who would turn their hand to whatever paid. But during the drugs boom of the 1990s, they saw the opportunity to get rich quick, moving to the Costa del Sol to establish an organised syndicate that smuggled cocaine from South America, through Europe and into the UK. Once there, the gang, known in the criminal world as the Huyton Firm, had established supply networks that spread from Plymouth to Scotland.\n\nThe amounts of class A drugs they dealt in resulted in extreme wealth. A court sentencing for Paul Fitzsimmons, a criminal associate who \"answered directly to Francis Coggins,\" previously heard the OCG's overall involvement in class A drugs over a three-month period during 2020 was calculated at 148 kg of cocaine and 248 kg of heroin. However, the true amount could be significantly higher.\n\nThe ECHO understands that the Coggins firm imported their illicit cargo through the Port of Liverpool. Analysis of messages saw the group referring to workers at the port watching containers to see whether they attracted attention from port agency authorities. It's likely that these supply routes that opened up the Coggins' gang to receive shipments from anywhere in the world were a driving force in allowing the gang to build international power and reputation. Investigating police officers told the ECHO no port workers were identified or investigated as part of their operation.\n\nInvestigators do not know exactly when the gang started to use the encrypted messaging service platform EncroChat. The network was favoured by high-profile criminals because it was believed at the time to be totally secure. Criminal organisations used the expensive phones, which cost between \u00a31,200 and \u00a31,500 for a six-month contract, to organise their criminal activities without fear of their messages ever being seen by law enforcement.\n\nUsing the EncroChat network, Coggins and his associates arranged and carried out multiple deals involving huge sums of drugs and cash. They communicated with other gangs both in Merseyside and further afield, overseeing supply lines. They thought their messages were going secret, but little did they know police had obtained access to EncroChat after French and Dutch authorities had hacked into the network in early April 2020.\n\nPolice were now monitoring their every move. Each user was assigned a unique \"handle\" on the EncroChat network, and through careful monitoring of each message, investigating officers were able to identify the gang members. At the top was Vincent Coggins, who went by the handle \"moonlitboat\". Under him were Michael Earle and Jarvis, who went by the handles \"bladehedge\" and \"Softherb\" respectively, while associate Paul Woodford used the handle \"kingwasp\".\n\nOther associates, including Dean Borrows, Fitzsimmons, Darren Tierney and Kevin Rimmer, were also linked to the handles \"Olivescooter,\" \"Northknee\", \"Scalpstaff\" and \"Sappystag\" through their disclosure of personal information. Two other handles - \"tallcanine\" and \"mixedjet\" featured prominently in the messages between Vincent Coggins, Jarvis, Earle and Woodford.\n\nAlex Leach KC, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of trials relating to the gang, told Manchester Crown Court during the trial of Jarvis: \"The chat reveals that the user of both handles was based in Amsterdam during this period and the evidence strongly suggests that he was Vincent Coggins' brother Francis.\n\n\"He played an important and authoritative role within the group: Jarvis deferred to him on most matters and he often discussed important strategic decisions with his brother Vincent.\" Francis Coggins has not yet been apprehended in relation to the investigation.\n\nMessages between the Coggins brothers and Jarvis revealed the gang discussing the sales of \"tops\" (cocaine) and \"botts\" (heroin). The EncroChat messages showed the gang discussing international shipments and deals, while also advertising their \"belter\" product to buyers in Scotland, South Wales and elsewhere. But the gang also shared personal information about each other that helped the police's investigati on.\n\nOn one occasion, on May 11 2020, Jarvis and Vincent Coggins discussed making a trip to Costco together. Jarvis used his UK mobile phone to connect to a mast that provided coverage to Costco. Vincent Coggins, who was a member at Costco, conducted two transactions where frozen crispy duck was purchased. Later that evening, the pair, using their EncroChat handles to discuss if the duck could be cooked from frozen or if it had to be defrosted.\n\nHowever, although subordinate roles were played by a number of conspirators, above all of them were the Coggins - Francis in Amsterdam and Vincent, referred to in some messages as \"the headmaster,\" at home in Cantril Farm, now known as Stockbridge Village. And when the stash house, minded by Paul Glynn, was robbed and 30 kilos of cocaine was stolen, it was Vincent Coggins' loss and it was he who controlled the response to taking it back.\n\nCCTV footage from a neighbour's home on Croxdale Road West showed the violent attack. Just before 9.30am, a white van pulled up outside the stash house and four men got out, three wearing dark clothes and balaclavas while a fourth posed as a delivery man. They rushed towards the house where they were met by a stunned dad and son, launching into a savage attack that resulted in Paul Glynn almost losing an arm after it was slashed down to the bone. Images later shared by the police showed huge blood splatters sprayed across the front entrance to the house.\n\nPolice received a call from Paul Glynn's son Kenny which said \"these lads just came into the house and started stabbing me dad and there's blood everywhere\". But by that time, and unknown to the Glynn's until later, their attackers had left the scene with a bag containing \u00a31m worth of cocaine.\n\nThe first the rest of the gang heard about the robbery was when Francis Coggins saw a report in the ECHO about the stabbing. And by 7.41pm that night, Vincent Coggins knew the drugs were gone. It was here that the ruthlessness of the Coggins brothers was truly shown. Without a definitive name, Vincent Coggins' suspicions first fell on Kenny Glynn. Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis, his eyes and ears on the investigation, \"Got to be the son, f*** it, I kill him.\"\n\nIn the following days Vincent Coggins directed his troops to find those responsible. After obtaining a CCTV video, he directed Jarvis and Fitzsimmons to distribute it across the underworld for help. And when he had a name, he started to put in place a plan of action. He messaged Earle \"M8 can you sort pineapple tonight\" - a term used to refer to a hand grenade, while Woodford offered to buy a firearm and ammunition on Vincent Coggins' behalf.\n\nHis target was Brian Maxwell, a professional drug dealer who later used the EncroChat phone network to source weapons including semi-automatic AR-15 rifles and an AK47 to protect himself from attack. Even when presented with potential evidence that Maxwell Jr could not have been involved in the robbery because he had CCTV of him at home all day and advised to leave it until the following day, Vincent Coggins refused. He messaged Earle \"No m8 tonight now got to be done we don't mess round\". It was only the failure in delivering the grenade to the attacker that halted the proceeding for another day.\n\nVincent Coggins reported to Earle his intention at approaching Brian Maxwell's dad, Brian Maxwell Sr, with an ultimatum. Return the drugs or the money, or he would pay. Having monitored the messages, the police took their first steps to disrupt Vincent Coggins' plans. On May 27 they visited Brian Maxwell Jr's home and issued him with a threat to life notice, also known as an Osman warning.\n\nArmed police also visited an address linked to Vincent Coggins to issue a disruption notice - a warning not to engage in any criminal activity. Undeterred, he continued to set in motion plans to kill Brian Maxwell Jr, as well as two other men he believed were involved - Michael Eves and Iyobosa 'Bosa' Igbinovia. On May 28 Jarvis messaged Vincent Coggins alleged evidence that the pair considered incriminating the three men even further in the robbery.\n\nAn EncroChat message at around 2.30pm that day said: \"..he told me they were all out together Maxwell boser eves Saturday afternoon til Sunday for anniversary drink...so Maxwell saying he got CCTV of himself not leaving house on Saturday is a f***ing lie\". Later that day Coggins messaged Fitzsimmons saying \"they all getting it\".\n\nThe Maxwells communicated with Vincent Coggins, Earle and Jarvis through a third party, a man who is still due to appear before the courts so can't be identified. Fearing an attack on his son was imminent, Maxwell Sr sent a proposal to the gang.\n\nHe knew his son had not committed the robbery but understanding the threat said \"me solution involves me and me alone paying the bill and then its me that's been robbed, I'd rather have him than the money...and it wont be in grip coz I haven't got it any more than he has...then its down to me to find out who done it...any money I've got means f*** all if he dead\".\n\nMaxwell Sr offered around \u00a31,360,000 to Vincent Coggins, split into cash and the sale of land and a house. Vincent Coggins accepted the offer. But a chilling message to Earle later the same day showed it was just a temporary peace. \"F*** me still going to kill them all but can take time now leave dad alone\", he wrote.\n\nPolice disruption continued despite the movements of the gang. Police attended Maxwell Sr's home and gave him an Osman warning, while Earle was issued a disruption notice. Unnerved by the police attention, Earle appeared to back out. However, Vincent Coggins was undeterred. He wrote back: \"Am staying till I've got every penny an at least done of one of the c****\". On June 3, Maxwell Sr signed over the money, the land and the house.\n\nWith police sniffing around his business, Vincent Coggins asked Woodford to use his police contact, known as \"the computer man\", to get copies of what was being said about him on the Police National Computer database. The contact told them there were new updates to Vincent Coggins profile, but they had not been able to take a photo. These were arranged through another EncroChat contact, Michael Burns, who used the handle MillionDolla.\n\nMerseyside Police later told the ECHO an anti-corruption team reviewed the messages and an extensive search of force systems in relation to those individuals was carried out to identify if there was any unauthorised access to information in relation to them and to identify any potential suspect. A spokesperson for the force said: \"A number of individuals were identified as having had access for a legitimate policing purpose, including staff from other forces, and no corruption was identified.\"\n\nOn June 13 2020, EncroChat administrators sent all users the message that the domain had been compromised and they could no longer guarantee the security of the devices. They advised users to power off and to physically dispose of their devices.\n\nThree days later, Vincent Coggins, Woodford, Earle and Jarvis were all arrested by the police. The Maxwells were arrested several months later. During his court sentencing, Maxwell Jr's defence said the police operation to disrupt the hand grenade attack \"had probably saved his life\".\n\nWhen the stash house was first robbed, Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis \"no way manks f***er local\", referring to the fact he could not believe a Manchester gang would be brave enough to come down the M56 carry out the raid. However, further examinations of the EncroChat network led investigators to the rival crime group behind the raid.\n\nSalford gangsters Jason and Craig Cox had targeted the stash house in collaboration with Liverpool career criminal Richard Caswell. The \"tight knit\" Cox crime gang were involved in large scale drug dealing, but in a bid to step up in the underworld, Jason Cox decided to join forces with Caswell, a well-known figure previously linked to a spate of car bombings across the city in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAfter a number of surveillance trips to scope out the address, they raided the house, making off with \u00a31m of cocaine which Jason Cox split with Caswell. Jason Cox would go on to sell his shares to notorious drug dealer Leon Atkinson - an associate of both police killer Dale Cregan and Merseyside-based suppliers the Cassidy brothers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the robbery, Jason Cox said in EncroChat messages how he had got cocaine from \"the biggest firm in Liverpool\". But he also realised the threat he now faced. Messages showed he enquired about renting a new flat, and eventually fled with his brother Lee to Spain. Caswell was playing an even more dangerous game.\n\nAs Coggins' firm desperately tried to work out who had ripped them off, they asked him directly if he had information regarding the raid. Caswell played dumb and said he would ask around, but passed on what they had told him to Jason Cox. The fall-out when the identities of the robbers was seismic in the underworld.\n\nArson attacks at properties linked to the Cox family in Salford were reported to Greater Manchester Police, while Caswell was slashed in HMP Manchester. A spokesperson for the Manchester force said they had issued a number of Osman warnings to the Cox family and their associates, and was working with the prison service after Jason Cox said he would have to \"look over his shoulder\" for the rest of his life. The Cox brothers, Caswell and \"foot soldier\" Ben Monks-Gorton, who posed as the delivery driver, were all jailed last year.\n\nCoggins and his associates answered no comment in their interviews. But by this time, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU), who were investigating the gang, had gathered thousands of messages that tied the Coggins' operation together. The arrests of Coggins and his potentially deadly associates marked the first EncroChat arrests made by the NWROCU - codenamed Operation SubZero - and the first time the force's EncroChat evidence would have to stand up in court.\n\nThose sentenced as part of Operation SubZero were:\n\nVincent Coggins, 58, of Woodpecker Close, West Derby, who was jailed for 28 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nPaul Woodford, 58, of Marl Road, Kirkby, was jailed for 24 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nMichael Earle, 48, of Wallace Drive, Huyton, was jailed for 11 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nDarren Tierney, 46, of Chatham Street, Stockport, was jailed for 12 years and nine months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Fitzsimmons, 60, of Birch Tree Court, West Derby, was jailed for 12 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nKevin Rimmer, 57, of Blacklow Brow, Huyton, was jailed for 16 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nDean Borrows, 39, of Ledson Grove, Aughton, was jailed for 14 years and three months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Glynn, 59, of Croxdale Road West, West Derby, was jailed for 11 years and two months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs\n\nRobert Jarvis, 59, of Breckside Park, Anfield, is due to be sentenced after he was found guilty at trial for conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nFrancis Coggins, who is understood to be in Europe, is wanted in the UK.\n\nSince the EncroChat breakthrough in April 2020, investigating police forces have managed to convict 1,600 criminals across the UK. However, Vincent Coggins - and many of his Huyton Firm - were some of the very first.\n\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the Echo Daily newsletter here", "source": {"uri":

Vincent Coggins was at the helm of a Liverpool organised crime group (OCG) involved in distributing vast quantities of cocaine and heroin across the UK.\n\nRaised in Knowsley's Cantril Farm during the 1970s and 80s Vincent and his brother Francis built their formidable drug gang from scratch into a legitimate cartel that rivalled criminal factions from Ireland, Eastern Europe, and South America. Sources previously reported the pair avoided disputes and unnecessary fallouts wherever possible. However they were not hesitant to order severe violence against anyone who threatened their interests.\n\nOn the morning of Saturday, May 23, 2020, a violent armed robbery took place at a house in Croxdale Road West, West Derby. The targeted attack, orchestrated by rival gangsters aware of the drugs stashed there, resulted in the homeowner and his son being severely assaulted and large amounts of cocaine stolen. Vincent Coggins, along with his criminal associates including his right-hand man Edward Jarvis, vowed to identify those responsible, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nHowever Vincent Coggins had more than just recovery of his drugs in mind. He also expressed a desire to kill the thieves. Unbeknownst to him and his criminal associates their every move was being monitored by the authorities following the hack of the EncroChat network.\n\nThis would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall and Vincent Coggins' arrest and conviction. Now, after nearly four years of extensive reporting restrictions that have prevented the media from being able to identify those involved in the gang, it can all be revealed following the conclusion of Jarvis' trial at Manchester Crown Court.\n\nThe Coggins brothers, Jarvis, and a number of their associates were career criminals who would turn their hand to whatever paid. But during the drugs boom of the 1990s they saw the opportunity to get rich quick, moving to the Costa del Sol to establish an organised syndicate that smuggled cocaine from South America, through Europe, and into the UK.\n\nOnce there the gang, known in the criminal world as the Huyton Firm, had established supply networks that spread from Plymouth to Scotland. The amounts of Class A drugs they dealt in resulted in extreme wealth. A court sentencing for Paul Fitzsimmons, a criminal associate who \"answered directly to Francis Coggins,\" previously heard the OCG's overall involvement in Class A drugs over a three-month period during 2020 was calculated at 148kg of cocaine and 248kg of heroin. However the true amount could be significantly higher.\n\nThe Liverpool Echo has learned the Coggins gang imported their illegal cargo through the Port of Liverpool. Analysis of messages revealed the group referring to port workers watching containers to see if they attracted attention from port agency authorities.\n\nIt's believed that these supply routes, which allowed the gang to receive shipments from anywhere in the world, were instrumental in enabling the gang to build international power and reputation. Police officers investigating the case said no port workers were identified or investigated as part of their operation.\n\nInvestigators are unsure exactly when the gang began using the encrypted messaging service platform EncroChat. The network was popular among high-profile criminals because it was thought to be completely secure at the time. Criminal organisations used the expensive phones, which cost between \u00a31,200 and \u00a31,500 for a six-month contract, to organise their criminal activities without fear of their messages ever being seen by law enforcement.\n\nUsing the EncroChat network Coggins and his associates arranged and executed multiple deals involving large amounts of drugs and cash. They communicated with other gangs both in Merseyside and further afield managing supply lines. They believed their messages were going unnoticed but they were unaware that police had gained access to EncroChat after French and Dutch authorities hacked into the network in early April 2020.\n\nThe movements of the gang were closely monitored by police. Each member of the ring had a unique alias on the EncroChat system, which allowed officers to track and identify them through their messages.\n\nRising to the top of the group was Vincent Coggins, known as \"moonlitboat\". Sitting just under him were Michael Earle and Jarvis, dubbed \"bladehedge\" and \"Softherb\" respectively, while associate Paul Woodford went by the name of \"kingwasp\".\n\nOther linked associates Dean Borrows, Fitzsimmons, Darren Tierney, and Kevin Rimmer were connected to aliases \"Olivescooter,\" \"Northknee\", \"Scalpstaff\" and \"Sappystag\" through their shared personal details. Central to the threads of communication between Vincent Coggins, Jarvis, Earle and Woodford were the unfamiliar handles \"tallcanine\" and \"mixedjet\".\n\nAlex Leach KC, a prosecuting barrister in numerous trials concerning the gang, revealed during Jarvis' Manchester Crown Court trial: \"The chat reveals that the user of both handles was based in Amsterdam during this period and the evidence strongly suggests that he was Vincent Coggins' brother Francis. He played an important and authoritative role within the group: Jarvis deferred to him on most matters and he often discussed important strategic decisions with his brother Vincent.\" Up until now Francis Coggins hasn't been arrested in connection with the investigation.\n\nMessages between the Coggins brothers and Jarvis illustrate the gang discussing the sales of \"tops\" (cocaine) and \"botts\" (heroin). The secret exchanges revealed discussions around international shipments and deals while also promoting their product to potential buyers in Scotland, south Wales, and other places. However it was the sharing of personal details that assisted with the police investigation.\n\nOn May 11, 2020, an instance emerged where Jarvis and Vincent Coggins planned a trip to Costco. Jarvis established connection via a mast providing coverage to Costco from his UK mobile phone. In the meantime Vincent Coggins made two purchases for frozen crispy duck at Costco as he was a member there. That evening they both conversed using their EncroChat handles about whether the duck needed to be defrosted or could be cooked directly from frozen.\n\nDespite several conspirators playing minor roles the Coggins brothers - Francis in Amsterdam and Vincent, often referred to as \"the headmaster,\" at Cantril Farm, renamed Stockbridge Village - were the major players in this operation. Vincent suffered a loss when Paul Glynn's stash house was robbed resulting in the theft of 30kg of cocaine. He then took charge in managing the response to reclaim the stolen product.\n\nCCTV footage from a neighbour's home in Croxdale Road West captured the brutal assault. At just before 9.30am a white van stopped outside the so-called 'stash house' and four men emerged. Three were clad in dark attire and balaclavas with the fourth masquerading as a delivery man.\n\nThey charged at the property where they were confronted by a shocked father and son. The ensuing violent confrontation saw Paul Glynn sustain life-threatening injuries with one arm slashed to the bone. Police later released images showing the front of the house spattered with large bloodstains.\n\nKenny Glynn, Paul Glynn's son, made an urgent call to the police reporting: \"These lads just came into the house and started stabbing me dad and there's blood everywhere.\" However, unbeknown to the Glynns at the time, their assailants had already fled the scene - taking with them a bag filled with cocaine valued at \u00a31m.\n\nThe rest of the gang only became aware of the heist after Francis Coggins stumbled upon a news report about the stabbing. By 7.41pm that evening Vincent Coggins was informed that the drugs had been taken. It was at this point that the cold-blooded nature of the Coggins brothers truly came to light. Without concrete evidence suspicion initially fell on Kenny Glynn.\n\nIn a message to Jarvis, who kept tabs on the investigation for him, Vincent Coggins wrote: \"Got to be the son, f*** it, I kill him.\" In the days that followed Vincent Coggins commanded his crew to track down those behind the heist. After securing CCTV footage he instructed Jarvis and Fitzsimmons to circulate it in the criminal underworld for identification assistance.\n\nOnce he had a suspect Coggins began orchestrating his retaliation. He texted Earle: \"M8 can you sort pineapple tonight\", with 'pineapple' being slang for a grenade, while Woodford was willing to procure a gun and bullets for Coggins.\n\nHis mark was Brian Maxwell, a seasoned narcotics trader who later turned to the EncroChat network to acquire arms, including AR-15 semi-automatic rifles and an AK47, for self-defence. Despite evidence suggesting Maxwell Jr might be innocent, as he appeared on home CCTV all day, and advice to postpone action, Coggins was adamant, texting Earle: \"No m8 tonight now got to be done we don't mess round\".\n\nA botched grenade delivery delayed their plans by a day. Coggins planned to confront Brian Maxwell's father, Brian Maxwell Sr, with a stark choice: return the stolen drugs or cash or face consequences. Police, having intercepted the messages, made their move to thwart Coggins' scheme. On May 27 they issued a 'threat to life' notice, known as an Osman warning, to Brian Maxwell Jr at his residence.\n\nArmed officers visited an address linked to Vincent Coggins to serve a disruption notice effectively warning him against any further criminal conduct. However Coggins remained undeterred and proceeded with plans to target Brian Maxwell Jr, as well as Michael Eves and Iyobosa 'Bosa' Igbinovia, whom he suspected of involvement.\n\nOn May 28 Jarvis sent a message to Coggins presenting what they considered damning evidence that would implicate the trio even more in the robbery. An EncroChat message sent at approximately 2.30 pm that day read: \"..he told me they were all out together Maxwell boser eves Saturday afternoon til Sunday for anniversary drink...so Maxwell saying he got CCTV of himself not leaving house on Saturday is a f***ing lie\". Later Coggins messaged Fitzsimmons with a chilling declaration: \"they all getting it\".\n\nThe Maxwells, through a third party who remains unnamed due to pending legal proceedings, communicated with Vincent Coggins, Earle, and Jarvis. With the threat to his son escalating Maxwell Sr offered a desperate solution to the gang.\n\nAware that his son was innocent but recognising the grave danger he proposed: \"me solution involves me and me alone paying the bill and then its me that's been robbed, I'd rather have him than the money...and it wont be in grip coz I haven't got it any more than he has...then its down to me to find out who done it...any money I've got means f*** all if he dead\".\n\nMaxwell Sr offered a staggering \u00a31,360,000 to Vincent Coggins comprising both cash and property assets. Coggins accepted the deal. Yet a disturbing text to Earle later that day hinted at a fa\u00e7ade of reconciliation: \"F*** me still going to kill them all but can take time now leave dad alone\", he chillingly penned.\n\nDespite the gang's activities police intervention persisted. Officers delivered an Osman warning to Maxwell Sr at his residence while Earle received a disruption notice.\n\nThe police focus seemed to unsettle Earle prompting him to consider withdrawing. Conversely Coggins remained resolute, replying: \"Am staying till I've got every penny an at least done of one of the c****\". On June 3 Maxwell Sr completed the transfer of funds, land, and property.\n\nAs law enforcement closed in on his operations Coggins sought assistance from Woodford to leverage his police insider, dubbed \"the computer man\", to secure information from the Police National Computer about himself. Although unable to procure a photograph the informant confirmed fresh updates to Coggins' profile. These details were facilitated by another EncroChat user, Michael Burns, known by the alias MillionDolla.\n\nBehind bars:\n\nMerseyside Police say their anti-corruption team scrutinised the messages and conducted a thorough search of force systems concerning those individuals to ascertain if there was any unauthorised access to information about them and to pinpoint any potential suspect. A spokesperson for the force stated: \"A number of individuals were identified as having had access for a legitimate policing purpose, including staff from other forces, and no corruption was identified.\"\n\nOn June 13, 2020, EncroChat administrators alerted all users with a message that the domain had been compromised and they could no longer ensure the security of the devices, recommending users to switch off and dispose of their devices. Three days on Vincent Coggins, Woodford, Earle, and Jarvis were apprehended by the police. The Maxwells faced arrest several months thereafter.\n\nDuring Maxwell Jr's court sentencing his defence mentioned that the police operation to thwart the hand grenade attack \"had probably saved his life\". When the stash house was initially burgled, Vincent Coggins sent a message to Jarvis saying \"no way manks f***er local\", expressing disbelief that a Manchester gang would dare to travel down the M56 to execute the heist. Yet further analysis of the EncroChat network led investigators straight to the rival criminal faction responsible for the robbery.\n\nSalford gangsters Jason and Craig Cox plotted to steal \u00a31m of cocaine from a stash house in collaboration with Liverpool career criminal Richard Caswell. The Cox brothers, who were part of a \"tight-knit\" crime gang involved in large-scale drug dealing, decided to join forces with Caswell in a bid to step up in the underworld.\n\nAfter a number of surveillance trips to scope out the address the trio raided the house and made off with the drugs, which Jason Cox split with Caswell. Jason Cox would go on to sell his share of the cocaine to notorious drug dealer Leon Atkinson, an associate of both police killer Dale Cregan and Merseyside-based suppliers the Cassidy brothers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the robbery Jason Cox said in EncroChat messages how he had got cocaine from \"the biggest firm in Liverpool\". However he also realised the threat he now faced and inquired about renting a new flat before fleeing to Spain with his brother Lee.\n\nCaswell, meanwhile, played a dangerous game. When Coggins' firm, who had lost the drugs, asked him directly if he had information regarding the raid he pretended not to know anything but passed on what they had told him to Jason Cox.\n\nThe revelation of the robbers' identities caused a major fallout in the underworld. Arson attacks at properties linked to the Cox family in Salford were reported to Greater Manchester Police while Caswell was slashed in HMP Manchester.\n\nA spokesman for the Manchester force said they had issued a number of Osman warnings to the Cox family and their associates and they were working with the prison service after Jason Cox said he would have to \"look over his shoulder\" for the rest of his life. The Cox brothers, Caswell, and \"foot soldier\" Ben Monks-Gorton, who posed as the delivery driver, were all jailed last year.\n\nCoggins and his associates answered no comment in their interviews. But by this time the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU), who were investigating the gang, had gathered thousands of messages that tied the Coggins' operation together.\n\nThe arrests of Coggins and his potentially deadly associates marked the first EncroChat arrests made by the NWROCU, codenamed Operation SubZero, and the first time the force's EncroChat evidence would have to stand up in court.\n\nThose sentenced as part of Operation SubZero were:\n\nVincent Coggins, 58, of Woodpecker Close, West Derby, who was jailed for 28 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail. Paul Woodford, 58, of Marl Road, Kirkby, was jailed for 24 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail. Michael Earle, 48, from Wallace Drive, Huyton, was sentenced to 11 years in prison after admitting to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail. Darren Tierney, 46, of Chatham Street, Stockport, received a sentence of 12 years and nine months after he confessed to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Paul Fitzsimmons, 60, of Birch Tree Court, West Derby, was handed a 12-year and six-month sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Kevin Rimmer, 57, from Blacklow Brow, Huyton, was imprisoned for 16 years after admitting to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Dean Borrows, 39, of Ledson Grove, Aughton, was sentenced to 14 years and three months after admitting to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Paul Glynn, 59, from Croxdale Road West, West Derby, was given an 11-year-and-two-month sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Robert Jarvis, 59, of Breckside Park, Anfield, is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty at trial of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nFrancis Coggins, believed to be in Europe, is wanted in the UK. Since the EncroChat breakthrough in April 2020 investigating police forces have managed to convict 1,600 criminals across the UK. However Vincent Coggins, and many of his Huyton Firm, were some of the very first.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They smuggled cocaine from South America, through Europe and into the UK.\n\nBut on the morning of Saturday, May 23 2020, their empire was targeted in a violent armed robbery was carried out at their stash house on Croxdale Road West, West Derby.\n\nThe attack by rival gangsters saw the homeowner and his son severely assaulted and huge amounts of cocaine stolen.\n\nVincent Coggins and his associates, including right-hand man Robert Jarvis, were determined to find the culprits and get their drugs back. Coggins also expressed a desire to kill them.\n\nThe gang wasn't aware that their every move was being monitored by the authorities following a hack of the EncroChat network that would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall and Vincent Coggins' arrest and conviction.\n\nNow, the Liverpool ECHO has revealed the story of the gang's downfall and Coggins' arrest and conviction, following the conclusion of Jarvis' trial at Manchester Crown Court.\n\nRobert Jarvis, 59, from Anfield, is due to be sentenced after he was found guilty at trial for conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nA court sentencing for Paul Fitzsimmons, a criminal associate who \"answered directly to Francis Coggins,\" previously heard the OCG's overall involvement in class A drugs over a three-month period during 2020 was calculated at 148 kg of cocaine and 248 kg of heroin. However, the true amount could be significantly higher.\n\nUsing the EncroChat network, Coggins and his associates arranged and carried out multiple deals involving huge sums of drugs and cash. They communicated with other gangs both in Merseyside and further afield, overseeing supply lines. They thought their messages were going secret, but cops had obtained access to EncroChat after French and Dutch authorities had hacked into the network in early April 2020.\n\nPolice were now monitoring their every move. Each user was assigned a unique \"handle\" on the EncroChat network, and through careful monitoring of each message, investigating officers were able to identify the gang members.\n\nAlex Leach KC, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of trials relating to the gang, told Manchester Crown Court during the trial of Jarvis: \"The chat reveals that the user of both handles was based in Amsterdam during this period and the evidence strongly suggests that he was Vincent Coggins' brother Francis.\n\n\"He played an important and authoritative role within the group: Jarvis deferred to him on most matters and he often discussed important strategic decisions with his brother Vincent.\" Francis Coggins has not yet been apprehended in relation to the investigation.\n\nMessages between the Coggins brothers and Jarvis revealed the gang discussing the sales of \"tops\" (cocaine) and \"botts\" (heroin). The EncroChat messages showed the gang discussing international shipments and deals, while also advertising their \"belter\" product to buyers in Scotland, South Wales and elsewhere. But the gang also shared personal information about each other that helped the police's investigation.\n\nWhen the stash house, minded by Paul Glynn, was robbed and 30 kilos of cocaine was stolen, CCTV footage from a neighbour's home on Croxdale Road West showed the violent attack.\n\nJust before 9.30am, a white van pulled up outside the stash house and four men got out, three wearing dark clothes and balaclavas while a fourth posed as a delivery man. They rushed towards the house where they were met by a stunned dad and son, launching into a savage attack that resulted in Paul Glynn almost losing an arm after it was slashed down to the bone. Images later shared by the police showed huge blood splatters sprayed across the front entrance to the house.\n\nPolice received a call from Paul Glynn's son Kenny which said \"these lads just came into the house and started stabbing me dad and there's blood everywhere\". But by that time, and unknown to the Glynn's until later, their attackers had left the scene with a bag containing \u00a31m worth of cocaine.\n\nBy 7.41pm that night, Vincent Coggins knew the drugs were gone. It was here that the ruthlessness of the Coggins brothers was truly shown. Without a definitive name, Vincent Coggins' suspicions first fell on Kenny Glynn. Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis, his eyes and ears on the investigation, \"Got to be the son, f*** it, I kill him.\"\n\nIn the following days Vincent Coggins messaged Earle \"M8 can you sort pineapple tonight\" - a term used to refer to a hand grenade, while Woodford offered to buy a firearm and ammunition on Vincent Coggins' behalf.\n\nHis target was Brian Maxwell, a professional drug dealer who later used the EncroChat phone network to source weapons including semi-automatic AR-15 rifles and an AK47 to protect himself from attack. Even when presented with potential evidence that Maxwell Jr could not have been involved in the robbery because he had CCTV of him at home all day and advised to leave it until the following day, Vincent Coggins refused.\n\nHe messaged Earle \"No m8 tonight now got to be done we don't mess round\". It was only the failure in delivering the grenade to the attacker that halted the proceeding for another day.\n\nVincent Coggins reported to Earle his intention at approaching Brian Maxwell's dad, Brian Maxwell Sr, with an ultimatum. Return the drugs or the money, or he would pay. Having monitored the messages, the police took their first steps to disrupt Vincent Coggins' plans. On May 27 they visited Brian Maxwell Jr's home and issued him with a threat to life notice, also known as an Osman warning.\n\nArmed police also visited an address linked to Vincent Coggins to issue a disruption notice - a warning not to engage in any criminal activity. Undeterred, he continued to set in motion plans to kill Brian Maxwell Jr, as well as two other men he believed were involved - Michael Eves and Iyobosa 'Bosa' Igbinovia. On May 28 Jarvis messaged Vincent Coggins alleged evidence that the pair considered incriminating the three men even further in the robbery.\n\nAn EncroChat message at around 2.30pm that day said: \"..he told me they were all out together Maxwell boser eves Saturday afternoon til Sunday for anniversary drink...so Maxwell saying he got CCTV of himself not leaving house on Saturday is a f***ing lie\". Later that day Coggins messaged Fitzsimmons saying \"they all getting it\".\n\nThe Maxwells communicated with Vincent Coggins, Earle and Jarvis through a third party, a man who is still due to appear before the courts so can't be identified. Fearing an attack on his son was imminent, Maxwell Sr sent a proposal to the gang.\n\nHe knew his son had not committed the robbery but understanding the threat said \"me solution involves me and me alone paying the bill and then its me that's been robbed, I'd rather have him than the money...and it wont be in grip coz I haven't got it any more than he has...then its down to me to find out who done it...any money I've got means f*** all if he dead\".\n\nMaxwell Sr offered around \u00a31,360,000 to Vincent Coggins, split into cash and the sale of land and a house. Vincent Coggins accepted the offer. But a chilling message to Earle later the same day showed it was just a temporary peace. \"F*** me still going to kill them all but can take time now leave dad alone\", he wrote.\n\nPolice disruption continued despite the movements of the gang. Police attended Maxwell Sr's home and gave him an Osman warning, while Earle was issued a disruption notice. Unnerved by the police attention, Earle appeared to back out. However, Vincent Coggins was undeterred. He wrote back: \"Am staying till I've got every penny an at least done of one of the c****\". On June 3, Maxwell Sr signed over the money, the land and the house.\n\nWith police sniffing around his business, Vincent Coggins asked Woodford to use his police contact, known as \"the computer man\", to get copies of what was being said about him on the Police National Computer database. The contact told them there were new updates to Vincent Coggins profile, but they had not been able to take a photo. These were arranged through another EncroChat contact, Michael Burns, who used the handle MillionDolla.\n\nMerseyside Police later told the ECHO an anti-corruption team reviewed the messages and an extensive search of force systems in relation to those individuals was carried out to identify if there was any unauthorised access to information in relation to them and to identify any potential suspect. A spokesperson for the force said: \"A number of individuals were identified as having had access for a legitimate policing purpose, including staff from other forces, and no corruption was identified.\"\n\nOn June 13 2020, EncroChat administrators sent all users the message that the domain had been compromised and they could no longer guarantee the security of the devices. They advised users to power off and to physically dispose of their devices.\n\nThree days later, Vincent Coggins, Woodford, Earle and Jarvis were all arrested by the police. The Maxwells were arrested several months later. During his court sentencing, Maxwell Jr's defence said the police operation to disrupt the hand grenade attack \"had probably saved his life\".\n\nWhen the stash house was first robbed, Vincent Coggins messaged Jarvis \"no way manks f***er local\", referring to the fact he could not believe a Manchester gang would be brave enough to come down the M56 carry out the raid. However, further examinations of the EncroChat network led investigators to the rival crime group behind the raid.\n\nSalford gangsters Jason and Craig Cox had targeted the stash house in collaboration with Liverpool career criminal Richard Caswell. The \"tight knit\" Cox crime gang were involved in large scale drug dealing, but in a bid to step up in the underworld, Jason Cox decided to join forces with Caswell, a well-known figure previously linked to a spate of car bombings across the city in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAfter a number of surveillance trips to scope out the address, they raided the house, making off with \u00a31m of cocaine which Jason Cox split with Caswell. Jason Cox would go on to sell his shares to notorious drug dealer Leon Atkinson - an associate of both police killer Dale Cregan and Merseyside-based suppliers the Cassidy brothers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the robbery, Jason Cox said in EncroChat messages how he had got cocaine from \"the biggest firm in Liverpool\". But he also realised the threat he now faced. Messages showed he enquired about renting a new flat, and eventually fled with his brother Lee to Spain. Caswell was playing an even more dangerous game.\n\nAs Coggins' firm desperately tried to work out who had ripped them off, they asked him directly if he had information regarding the raid. Caswell played dumb and said he would ask around, but passed on what they had told him to Jason Cox. The fall-out when the identities of the robbers was seismic in the underworld.\n\nArson attacks at properties linked to the Cox family in Salford were reported to Greater Manchester Police, while Caswell was slashed in HMP Manchester. A spokesperson for the Manchester force said they had issued a number of Osman warnings to the Cox family and their associates, and was working with the prison service after Jason Cox said he would have to \"look over his shoulder\" for the rest of his life. The Cox brothers, Caswell and \"foot soldier\" Ben Monks-Gorton, who posed as the delivery driver, were all jailed last year.\n\nCoggins and his associates answered no comment in their interviews. But by this time, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU), who were investigating the gang, had gathered thousands of messages that tied the Coggins' operation together. The arrests of Coggins and his potentially deadly associates marked the first EncroChat arrests made by the NWROCU - codenamed Operation SubZero - and the first time the force's EncroChat evidence would have to stand up in court.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Jarvis helped orchestrate the gang's supply of large consignments of cocaine and heroin to mid-level dealers across Merseyside and the rest of the country.\n\nJarvis, along with his boss Coggins and co-conspirators Paul Woodford and Michael Earle, also plotted a violent vendetta against a number of individuals who they suspected had robbed one of the gang's stash houses and made off with over \u00a31m of cocaine. Little did they know that their plans, which had been made over EncroChat, were being watched by investigating police officers after the encrypted messaging platform was hacked in April 2020 by European law enforcement.\n\nPrison officers fear 'it's going to go off any day' at HMP Liverpool\n\nBest friends paid the 'ultimate price' after travelling to Cheshire Oaks\n\nA series of court cases heard over the past four years involving members of the OCG have been subject to a media blackout. Reporting restrictions on the naming of Coggins and his role as the head of the gang can now be revealed after Jarvis, who denied one count of conspiring with others to supply class A drugs, another count of the same offence concerning diamorphine and a conspiracy to blackmail charge, was unanimously found guilty by a jury at Manchester Crown Court.\n\nAt the start of the trial, which opened on March 14, Alex Leach KC, prosecuting, told the court: \"In the spring and early summer of 2020, in the first months of the first lockdown, a man named Vincent Coggins sat at the head of a group of organised criminals based in Liverpool. The group was engaged in the storing and supplying of wholesale, multi-kilo quantities of cocaine and heroin.\n\n\"They sold to people across the country, as well as locally on Merseyside. As the early spring and summer wore on, Edward Jarvis played a leading role in the organisation, orchestrating the large scale supply of drugs.\"\n\nThe Coggins operation used EncroChat phones to conduct their business and communicated on a day-to-day basis. Conversations analysed following the hack of the network helped law enforcement to attribute various handles to gang members involved in the conspiracies. Coggins was identified by the handle \"MoonlitBoat\", while Jarvis was unmasked as \"SoftHerb\".\n\nMr Leach told the court that analysis of the messages revealed a stack of evidence that allowed investigators to attribute the handle to Jarvis. Mr Leach said messages showed \"SoftHerb\" organised a birthday celebration on Sunday, April 5 with Coggins sending him a happy birthday message. The court heard Jarvis' birthday matched up to that date.\n\nJarvis meanwhile sent his boss a picture of himself enjoying the sunshine in his back garden, after which Coggins replied \"haha, looks like u on a beach\" before making reference to his partner.\n\nWoodford, using the handle \"KingWasp\", referred to him as \"Jarvo\" while another handle, \"MexicanNova\", referenced his daughter Bobbie and her partner who worked as a plumber. Mr Leach told the court Jarvis' communications saw him send a postcode for his address to two EncroChat users. He told \"FrostyBoom\": \"I'll wait for you in road, fat, baldy head, just drive in car park.\"\n\nAnother telling interaction saw Coggins and Jarvis use their EncroChat devices to \"discuss the cooking instructions for the duck they had bought\" and whether it could be \"cooked from frozen or not\". This matched up with information that saw Coggins' Costco membership card used on the same day and Jarvis' personal phone connecting to a mast covering the store.\n\nMr Leach told the court Jarvis and the others had no idea that EncroChat had been compromised and that police were aware of their activities. Jarvis ran the day-to-day affairs and was in communication almost daily with other criminals. Mr Leach said: \"Jarvis arranged deals with buyers and directed the couriers to deliver the drugs and collect the money.\"\n\nMessages attributed to Jarvis revealed him discussing the sales of \"tops\" (cocaine) and \"botts\" (heroin). The EncroChat messages showed the gang discussing international shipments and deals, while also advertising their \"belter\" product to buyers in Scotland, South Wales and elsewhere.\n\nAfter a stash-house on Croxdale Road West, West Derby was raided and \u00a31m of cocaine was robbed, Jarvis and other co-conspirators resolved to help Coggins to find those responsible. Mr Leach said messages revealed the group's identification and subsequent plan to attack three men - Brian Maxwell Jr, Michael Eves and Iyobosa Igbanovia.\n\nPolice took action to disrupt and frustrate the gang's plans and issued threat to life notices, known as Osman warnings, to the three men, as well as Maxwell's dad. Mr Leach said: \"The EncroChat messages also revealed that Brian Maxwell and his father knew where the threat was coming from, and that his father sought to resolve it peacefully by alternative means, so as to avoid the loss of his son.\n\n\"Although Brian Maxwell Jr always denied that he had been responsible for the robbery, and indeed others altogether have now been convicted of that robbery, as a result of the unwarranted menaces or threats received, his father was so afraid that his son would be killed by Coggins or people acting on his behalf, that he agreed to pay Coggins the value of the drugs - over a million pounds - in return for lifting the threat to his son's life.\"\n\nThe court heard the defendants, including Jarvis, were arrested on June 16 2020 - three days after the EncroChat hack was made public - and he answered no comment to all questions asked of him. Michael Bromley-Martin KC, representing Jarvis, said his client denied committing any of the offences on the indictment.\n\nDuring his defence, Mr Bromley-Martin presented to the court that Colin Cheshire, a man who lived downstairs from Jaris, was in fact the user of the phone when criminal activities were discussed. He added Mr Cheshire allegedly allowed Jarvis to access the phone at other times, such as when he sent photos of himself and details of his birthday to Coggins.\n\nMr Bromley-Martin said: \"If he was using the phone to tell people his birthday or pictures were sent of him sunning himself in the garden, or he was talking about his family, that would not be in furtherance of any conspiracy to supply drugs and his use of that phone would not be him using 'SoftHerb' in fourth of the conspiracies.\"\n\nHowever, a jury disagreed and unanimously found Jarvis, of Breckside Park, Anfield, guilty on all three counts after 11 hours and 42 minutes of deliberations. Jarvis, who wore a blue shirt, did not react as the jury delivered its verdicts.\n\nA date for his sentencing has yet to be set.\n\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the

The attack was carried out by two Salford gangsters and resulted in a father and son being brutally attacked and \u00a31m worth of cocaine stolen. This set off a chain of events leading to the downfall of gangland leader Vincent Coggins.\n\nCoggins was the head of an organised crime group involved in distributing large quantities of cocaine and heroin across the UK. Raised in Knowsley's Cantril Farm during the 70s and 80s, Coggins and his brother Francis built their formidable drug gang from scratch, creating a cartel that rivalled criminal factions from Ireland, Eastern Europe and South America.\n\nREAD MORE: Vladimir Putin 'had botox and lip fillers' giving cold demeanour at inauguration speech\n\nClick for more of the latest news from across the world from the Daily Star.\n\nThe targeted attack, conducted by rival gangsters who knew whose drugs were stashed there, saw the homeowner and his son severely assaulted and huge amounts of cocaine stolen. Vincent Coggins, along with his criminal associates including his right-hand man Edward Jarvis, resolved to identify who had taken them.\n\nHowever, Vincent Coggins wasn't just interested in retrieving his narcotics. He also expressed a desire to murder them, reports the Manchester Evening News. Unbeknownst to him and his criminal cohorts, the authorities were tracking their every move following the infamous EncroChat network hack.\n\nThis would ultimately lead to the gang's downfall and Vincent Coggins' arrest and conviction, but all the details have been withheld for four years . . . until now.\n\nThe Coggins brothers, Jarvis and several of their associates were career criminals who would turn their hand to whatever paid. But during the drugs boom of the 1990s, they saw the opportunity to get rich quick, moving to the Costa del Sol to establish an organised syndicate that smuggled cocaine from South America, through Europe and into the UK.\n\nOnce there, the gang, known in the criminal world as the Huyton Firm, had established supply networks that spread from Plymouth to Scotland. The quantities of class A drugs they dealt in resulted in extreme wealth. A court sentencing for Paul Fitzsimmons, a criminal associate who \"answered directly to Francis Coggins,\" previously heard the OCG's overall involvement in class A drugs over a three-month period during 2020 was calculated at 148 kg of cocaine and 248 kg of heroin.\n\nIt remains unclear when the gang began using the encrypted messaging service, EncroChat. This platform was popular among high-profile criminals due to its perceived security. The pricey phones, costing between \u00a31,200 and \u00a31,500 for a six-month contract, were used by criminal organisations to orchestrate their illicit activities without fear of law enforcement interception.\n\nUtilising the EncroChat network, Coggins and his crew arranged and executed numerous deals involving massive amounts of drugs and money. They liaised with other gangs in Merseyside and beyond, managing supply chains. They believed their communications were secure, but unbeknownst to them, police had gained access to EncroChat after it was hacked by French and Dutch authorities in early April 2020.\n\nVincent Coggins was known as \"moonlitboat\", while his cronies Michael Earle and Jarvis used \"bladehedge\" and \"Softherb\". Paul Woodford, another member of the crew, went by \"kingwasp\".\n\nThe gang's other mates like Dean Borrows, Fitzsimmons, Darren Tierney and Kevin Rimmer were rumbled too, linked to \"Olivescooter,\" \"Northknee\", \"Scalpstaff\" and \"Sappystag\" after they slipped up and shared personal info. Two more handles, \"tallcanine\" and \"mixedjet\", popped up regularly in chats with Vincent Coggins, Jarvis, Earle and Woodford.\n\nThose sentenced as part of Operation SubZero were:\n\nVincent Coggins, 58, of Woodpecker Close, West Derby, who was jailed for 28 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nPaul Woodford, 58, of Marl Road, Kirkby, was jailed for 24 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nMichael Earle, 48, of Wallace Drive, Huyton, was jailed for 11 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nDarren Tierney, 46, of Chatham Street, Stockport, was jailed for 12 years and nine months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Fitzsimmons, 60, of Birch Tree Court, West Derby, was jailed for 12 years and six months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nKevin Rimmer, 57, of Blacklow Brow, Huyton, was jailed for 16 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nDean Borrows, 39, of Ledson Grove, Aughton, was jailed for 14 years and three months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.\n\nPaul Glynn, 59, of Croxdale Road West, West Derby, was jailed for 11 years and two months after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs\n\nRobert Jarvis, 59, of Breckside Park, Anfield, is due to be sentenced after he was found guilty at trial for conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nClick for more of the latest news from across the world from the Daily Star.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk",

The Huyton brothers also plotted a ruthless vendetta of violence after a raid on their stash house by rival gangsters saw them lose in the region of \u00a31million of illicit substances.\n\nA series of court cases heard over the past four years have been subject to a media blackout until today, following the conclusion of proceedings against co-conspirator Edward Jarvis. Messages exchanged by the Coggins brothers and their associates over encrypted communications platform EncroChat can therefore now be detailed, having been aired during a number of trials and sentencing hearings.\n\nREAD MORE: Burglar who broke into house and stole dog says he was on 'rescue mission'\n\nREAD MORE: Judge tells lout 'you're on the way to ruining your life'\n\nConversations revealed after the network was infiltrated the French police during 2020 managed to identify Vincent as the user of the handle \"MoonlitBoat\", while Francis was said to have gone by the usernames \"TallCanine\" and \"MixedJet\". Paul Fitzsimmons was linked to the account \"NorthKnee\" after naming his mum and children during discussions with associates, while Dean Burrows was found to be \"OliveScooter\" as he had given his home address out and others had referred to him by his first name.\n\nSimilarly, Darren Tierney was referred to as \"Dazz\" by others while using the handle \"ScalpStaff\". The user also detailed how he drove a Citroen Berlingo, a van insured in his name at his sister's address and in which he had been stopped by the police previously, and informed contacts of when his birthday was.\n\nA whole stack of evidence saw Jarvis unmasked as \"SoftHerb\", who mentioned the names of his children and grandchildren to his contacts. Paul Woodford, using \"KingWasp\", also referred to him as \"Jarvo\" while another handle, \"MexicanNova\", referenced his daughter.\n\nJarvis' communications meanwhile saw him send both \"DestructiveTailor\" and \"FrostyBoom\" the postcode for his address on Breckside Park. He told the latter: \"I'll wait for you in road, fat, baldy head, just drive in car park.\"\n\nOne telling string of messages on May 11 2020 also identified both him and Vincent Coggins. Their handles messaged one another about visiting Costco that day, after which Jarvis' personal mobile phone connected to a mast covering the wholesale store.\n\nAround the same time, Coggins' Costco membership was used to complete two separate transactions - each for a pack of frozen crispy aromatic duck. Shortly after 7pm, their two Encro phones began communicating again to \"discuss the cooking instructions for the duck they had bought\" and whether their purchase could be \"cooked from frozen or not\".\n\nCoggins also wished Jarvis many happy returns on his birthday and asked if his son-in-law, who was the director of a plumbing and heating firm, could visit him in order to drain his radiators. Jarvis meanwhile sent his boss a picture of himself enjoying the sunshine in his back garden, after which Coggins replied \"haha, looks like u on a beach\" before making reference to his partner.\n\nVincent Coggins, aged 58 and of Woodpecker Close in West Derby, 58-year-old Paul Woodford, of Marl Road in Kirkby, and 48-year-old Michael Earle, of Wallace Drive in Huyton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail. They were imprisoned for 28 years, 28-and-a-half years and 11 years respectively.\n\nDean Borrows, aged 39 and of Ledson Grove in Aughton, 46-year-old Darren Tierney, of Chatham Street in Stockport, 60-year-old Paul Fitzsimmons, of Birch Tree Court in West Derby, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin. They were handed respective terms 14 years and three months, 12 years and nine months and 12-and-a-half years.\n\nKevin Rimmer, of Blacklow Brow in Huyton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin. The 57-year-old was locked up for 16 years.\n\nPaul Glynn, of Croxdale Road West in West Derby, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. The 59-year-old was given 11 years and two months.\n\nEdward Jarvis, of Breckside Park in Anfield, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and blackmail. The 59-year-old will be sentenced at a later date.\n\nFrancis Coggins has not yet been apprehended but is wanted by the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit.

Olivia's killer Thomas Cashman, was a hitman for Coggins before he was jailed for her murder.\n\nVincent, known as the Headmaster, and his older brother Francis gained a fearsome status similar to fellow Liverpool trafficker Curtis Warren. The pair reportedly moved to Spain in the 1990s and forged links with organised crime groups around the world.\n\nThomas Cashman, the convicted killer of Olivia Pratt-Korbel\n\nUsing international contacts they smuggled cocaine from Colombian cartels, through Europe and into the UK. Heavily-armed Spanish police stormed a Costa del Sol villa linked to the brothers in 2017 - but they were never charged.\n\nFour cannabis farms offering annual yields worth up to \u00a36.4million were smashed by officers. The Coggins brothers were later caught messaging about one cocaine deal worth \u00a316million and being helped by a corrupt police insider called \"piggy\".\n\nOlivia Pratt-Korbel Mum Cheryl\n\nVincent threatened to torture one local businessman, texting in broken English: \"Then we deside weather we slash him, chop his fingers off or wotever.\" The gangster later boasted he had slashed the man with a knife, writing \"slash across face an smashed his eyes in an took half an ear an tonge\".\n\nThe brothers can be named following the conclusion of a series of trials at Manchester crown court. Matt Horne, a former investigator at the National Crime Agency, said their \"industrial-scale trafficking of drugs\" and willingness to use severe violence put them \"in the upper tiers of organised crime in the UK\".\n\nThe gang used the EncroChat messaging system, believing their encrypted conversations were secure. But the network had been hacked by the NCA, giving detectives a window into their depraved world.\n\nIn May 2020, one of their \"stash houses\" was targeted in a machete and axe attack, and cocaine worth \u00a31million was stolen. The group's messages show a video of the raid was obtained by Cashman, who was jailed for life for Olivia's 2022 murder after she was caught in the crossfire of a gangland shooting.\n\nArmed police moved in\n\nThe day after the stash house robbery, Vincent reassured an associate that \"Tom\" - who we understand to be Cashman - would identify those responsible. He wrote: \"Tom will no them if local even if they masked up.\"\n\nWeed plants were found\n\nAccording to the messages, Cashman showed the video to others in an attempt to trace the robbers, who the gang wanted to murder. Talking about who he suspected, Vincent texted an underling: \"Got to be son. F*** it, I'll kill him.\" Later a furious Vincent said he wanted to launch a grenade attack. He wrote: \"Kids, we're going to pineapple, but shivs out.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've got the c*** banged to rights. Gived him a chance to give back the dough. I'm going to kill him.\" Vincent, using EncroChat handle Moonlitboat, wrongly identified those behind the robbery as Brian Maxwell Jr, Michael Eves and Iyobosa Igbinovia.\n\nFour other men from Salford, Gtr Manchester, were later jailed for the robbery. Messages between Vincent and associates including Paul Woodford, 58, Michael Earle, 48, and Edward Robert Jarvis, 59, showed him bent on brutal retribution. Maxwell Jr's dad, Brian Maxwell Sr, gave money, property and land worth \u00a31million to the gang in a bid to save his son's life, the court heard.\n\nOfficer held a suspect on the ground\n\nVincent assured Maxwell Sr after making the deal: \"I promise you and your fam, it's over. Have a nice life.\" But half an hour later he messaged an associate: \"Everyone know they dogs, I'll kill them in a few months when it's all calm down. Been very stressful week. Need a break.\"\n\nIn June 2020, three days after EncroChat told users of the hack, the gang were arrested. Most pleaded guilty but Jarvis, of Anfield, was convicted of plotting blackmail and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs this week.\n\nThe Coggins brothers grew up on the Cantril Farm estate on the edge of Liverpool in the 1970s. They are understood to have risen up the criminal hierarchy, before their reported move to Spain. The 2017 crackdown there involved Spain's Policia Nacional, Merseyside Police and the NCA and the investigation was reportedly sparked after an explosion at a Liverpool home led officers to a huge drugs haul.\n\nOfficers at the house\n\nVincent, of West Derby, was jailed for 28 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and plotting blackmail. Woodford, of Kirkby, was jailed for 24 years and six months and Earle, of Huyton, 11 years after both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail. Paul Glynn, 59, of West Derby, who was minding the raided stash house, was jailed for 11 years and two months after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine.\n\nDarren Tierney, 46, of Stockport, Gtr Manchester, was sentenced to 12 years and nine months; Paul Fitzsimmons, 60, of West Derby, 12 years and six months; Kevin Rimmer, 57, of Huyton, 16 years; and Dean Borrows, 39, of West Derby, 16 years; after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

revenge over theft of \u00a31 million cocaine stash convicted", "body": "Members of a drugs gang who plotted revenge on men they mistakenly believed had stolen their \u00a31 million cocaine stash have been convicted after their plan was discovered in encrypted messages.\n\nVincent Coggins, 58, was head of the high-ranking Merseyside crime gang whose \"stash house\" was targeted by a group posing as delivery drivers on 23 May 2020.\n\nThey then launched a violent machete and axe attack, leaving many seriously injured, before making off with \u00a31 million of cocaine.\n\nCoggins then used encrypted messaging service Encrochat - which had been intercepted by international law enforcement in April 2020 - to express a desire to kill those responsible for the robbery.\n\nManchester Crown Court heard Coggins, who was known as the \"headmaster\" and used the handle moonlitboat, wrongly identified those responsible as Brian Maxwell Junior, Michael Eves and Iyobosa Igbinovia.\n\nFour other men from Salford, Greater Manchester, were later jailed for the robbery.\n\nMessages between Coggins and associates including Paul Woodford, 58, Michael Earle, 48, and Edward Robert Jarvis, 59, showed discussions of plans for retribution.\n\nPolice, who were monitoring Encrochat messages, became aware of threats towards the men wrongly identified as the robbers by the Coggins organised crime group.\n\nThey issued threat-to-life notices, and attempted to warn off gang members with disruption notices.\n\nBut, as officers guarded those under threat, the gang still discussed revenge over messages.\n\nThe threats led to Maxwell Junior's father selling his home, to give money, property and land worth \u00a31 million to the gang in a bid to save his son's life, the court heard.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, three days after the Encrochat service alerted its users to the hack, the defendants were the first arrested by North West Regional Organised Crime Unit (NWROCU) officers as a result of the intercepted messages.\n\nAfter they were charged, Coggins, Woodford, Earle and Jarvis attempted to have the Encrochat evidence thrown out in a bid which could have impacted hundreds of other cases.\n\nIn a legal argument seen as a test case for other Encrochat trials, their lawyers claimed the evidence was inadmissible, but their attempt was eventually dismissed by the court.\n\nMost of the defendants pleaded guilty to offences but Jarvis, of Breckside Park, Liverpool, was convicted following a trial at Manchester Crown Court, of two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail, on Thursday, 9 May.\n\nReporting restrictions on the other cases were lifted on the conclusion of Jarvis's trial.\n\nCoggins, of Woodpecker Close, Liverpool, was jailed for 28 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nWoodford, of Marl Road, Liverpool, was jailed for 24 years and six months and Earle, of Wallace Drive, Huyton, was jailed for 11 years after both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and conspiracy to commit blackmail.\n\nPaul Glynn, 59, of Croxdale Road West, Liverpool, who was minding the stash house where the cocaine was stored and was attacked in the robbery, was jailed for 11 years and two months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine.\n\nDarren Tierney, 46, of Chatham Street, Stockport, was jailed for 12 years and nine months; Paul Fitzsimmons, 60, of Birch Tree Court, Liverpool, was jailed for 12 years and six months; Kevin Rimmer, 57, of

It said it was \"waiting for a confirmed toll of the dead and injured\".\n\nIt was not possible to immediately verify the report.\n\nThe RSF has repeatedly laid siege to and attacked entire villages across Sudan, particularly in the agricultural state of Gezira, where it took control of the capital Wad Madani in December.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the group said it had attacked army and allied militia bases around Wad al-Noura but did not acknowledge any civilian casualties.\n\nBut the Wad Madani Resistance Committees accused it of deadly attacks on civilians, looting and driving women and children to seek refuge in the nearby town of Managil.\n\nThe army-aligned Transitional Sovereign Council condemned the reported attack.\n\n\"These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behaviour of these militias in targeting civilians,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSudan's civil war erupted in April 2023, when a rivalry between Sudan's army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan \"Hemedti\" Dagalo exploded into an all-out conflict.\n\nWhile much of the early fighting took place around the capital, Khartoum, it quickly spread to other parts of Sudan, including the southwestern state of Darfur where it quickly took an interethnic dimension as old rivalries linked to a previous war that began in 2003 resurfaced.\n\nThe RSF emerged out of what rebel groups call the Janjaweed, an Arab force which killed thousands of non-Arabs in Darfur during a war that ended with a peace deal in 2020.\n\nThe war over the past 14 months has killed tens of thousands of people, destroyed infrastructure and crippled Sudan's economy.\n\nSome 8.3 million people have been displaced, with many forced into neighbouring Chad and South Sudan, while hunger and starvation are spreading.\n\n\"Time is running out for millions of people in Sudan who are at imminent risk of famine, displaced from their lands, living under bombardments, and cut off from humanitarian assistance,\" United Nations agencies warned in a joint statement last week.\n\nThe RSF has taken over most of western Sudan and is now seeking to advance into the centre of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been renewed fighting between the army and the western city of el-Fasher, with both sides using heavy weapons and artillery.\n\nClaire Nicolet, head of emergency response in Sudan for Doctors Without Borders, said the conflict is having a catastrophic effect on the population.\n\n\"If the situation continues like this, there will be really a very high mortality - that is for sure,\" she told Al Jazeera.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Clashes erupted with the army forces, according to the RSF, that killed eight of their members and wounded several others.\n\nThe RSF said it seized four military vehicles as well as dozens of weapons, including Kalashnikov rifles.\n\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces has yet to comment on the attack.\n\nThe attack and the high casualties stirred outrage among activists and political groups in Sudan, where the war between the RSF and SAF is raging into a second year.\n\nThe Transitional Sovereign Council, which is seen as close to the army, vehemently condemned the RSF attack, saying in a Thursday statement that \"the heinous massacre against defenseless civilians\" is another in the series of crimes committed by the RSF in its areas of control.\n\n\"These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\" the statement read. It urged the international community to hold the RSF accountable for the actions.\n\n'Gross human rights violations'\n\nThe Sudanese rights group Emergency Lawyers described the attack in Wad al-Noura \"as a painful example of gross human rights violations.\"\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the group said the incident amounts to \"a serious crime against humanity and a flagrant violation of the provisions of international humanitarian law and conventions.\"\n\nEmergency Lawyers called on the international community to ensure the protection of civilians in Sudan and to pressure the warring parties to respect international humanitarian law and human rights conventions.\n\nThe Sudanese Congress political party also denounced the attack in a statement issued Wednesday, calling it \"a heinous crime\" against innocent civilians. It further condemned the RSF's alleged human rights violations in Gezira since capturing it last December.\n\nSince the war between the SAF and the RSF erupted on April 15, 2023, the fighting has spread across Sudan, with the RSF taking control of all the states in the Darfur region and parts of Khartoum as well as the Gezira state, Sudan's breadbasket.\n\nThe death toll in Sudan's war remains unclear. While UN aid agencies estimate that more than 15,000 people have been killed in the conflict since April 2023, the United States believes the number to be as high as 150,000.\n\n\"We literally don't know how many people have died, possibly to a factor of 10 or 15. The number was mentioned earlier 15 to 30,000. Some think it's at 150,000,\" US special envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello said during a hearing at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early May.\n\nMore than 8.8 million have been displaced, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA. The war has created what UN agencies describe as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with the World Food Programme warning on Wednesday of looming widespread hunger and malnutrition in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, both sides to the conflict have been accused by UN agencies and rights groups of serious human rights violations and abuses. In December the United States accused the SAF and RSF of war crimes in Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Times", "body": "At least a hundred people have been killed in an attack by the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a village in Sudan. Several activists said this to the Reuters news agency. The news agency has not yet independently verified those numbers.\n\nThe attack took place in Al Jazira state, in the village of Wad Alnoura, about 100 kilometers south of the capital Khartoum. The state consists mainly of small villages with farms. In December, RSF fighters captured the capital Wad Madani.\n\nA reporter from the Reuters news agency posted a photo on X showing dozens of dead people wrapped in white cloths. The reporter speaks of the deadliest attack to date in the region.\n\n\"Wad Alnoura witnessed a genocide on Wednesday after two attacks by the RSF. Up to a hundred people were killed,\" said a statement from the pro-democracy Wad Madani resistance movement. That movement later estimated the number of deaths at hundreds. According to the organization, the Sudanese army did not respond to a request for help.\n\nThe RSF itself says it has carried out attacks on the army and allied militias in and around the village. The statement is silent on civilian casualties. The resistance movement accuses the RSF of using heavy artillery fire on civilians, looting and driving women and children to a nearby town.\n\nThe military-backed transitional council condemned the attack. \"These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in attacking civilians,\" the statement said.\n\nThe civil war in Sudan is already raging more than a year. The RSF and the Sudanese army are locked in a bloody battle for control in the East African country. The RSF's power in Darfur has been expanding ever since, villages are being burned down and they are conquering city after city.\n\nLooting, sexual and ethnic violence are the order of the day and help from the international community is slow to come. At the beginning of this year, the UN estimated that $3.8 billion in emergency aid is needed. At least 25 million people have been in need since the war broke out, millions of people have been displaced and the exact number of deaths is not clear.\n\nThe war started because the warring parties could not agree on the division of power after they jointly deposed autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir five years ago. He was in power for more than thirty years.", "source": {"uri": "oyetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oye!

They did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported.\n\nAccording to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation.\n\nHowever, eyewitnesses told CNN that there is no military presence in the village, adding that the Sudanese army operates a military base about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura, which is being cited as a possible reason for the attack.\n\nCNN has contacted both RSF and the Sudanese Army for comment.\n\nWad al-Nour village lies about 160 kilometers south of Sudanese capital Khartoum and is now the latest epicenter of violence in a country ravaged by internal conflict.\n\nThe village has long been a strategic target for the RSF, given its close location to Al-Manaqil, where the Sudanese army maintains its only presence in Al-Jazira state.\n\nThis was not the first attempt by the RSF to control Wad al-Noura, as they have tried several times to take the village.\n\nThousands have perished since fighting erupted between forces loyal to two rival generals - army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the SAF, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the RSF.\n\nSince the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres.\n\nThe RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan's agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said.\n\nIn March, eyewitnesses told CNN that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \"enlist or die.\" The RSF denied this claim.\n\nThe Sudanese Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF's actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians.\n\n\"This heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\" the Council stated.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) has warned that \"the number of people displaced by conflict inside Sudan could top 10 million in the coming days.\"\n\n\"The world's worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\" IOM said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that over 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million urgently need assistance.\n\nLast week at the UN Security Council, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned, \"The situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\"\n\nCNN's Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The number of victims exceeds 150 people, including children, women and the elderly,\" Minawi said in a post on X.\n\nThree eyewitnesses told CNN on Thursday that the RSF attacked the village with more than 40 armed vehicles and used heavy weapons, leaving 150 people dead and about 200 wounded.\n\nWitnesses said most of those who killed and wounded were civilians, among them children and women.\n\n\"There is no military presence in the village, but villagers set up positions to protect it,\" a witness and activist told CNN.\n\n\"The Sudanese Armed Forces are located at a military base in the city of Al-Manaqil, about 30 km (18 miles) southwest of Wad Al-Noura village,\" the witness added.\n\nAnother witness and activist from the same village said they were still assessing the number of casualties.\n\n\"So far, we've buried more than 120 people in a mass grave in the middle of the village of Wad al-Noura,\" the witness added. Another activist said the RSF was still surrounding the village, and there are ongoing fights near the village, and people fear further escalations.\n\nFootage shared on social media, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial.\n\nAnother video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties.\n\nThe RSF claimed in a statement Wednesday they launched a preemptive attack on Sudanese Army (SAF) camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\n\nAccording to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation.\n\nThey did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported in the statement shared on social media platform, X.\n\nThe Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF's actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \"This heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\" the Council said.\n\nThe council, headed by junta leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is the governing body that has ruled Sudan since former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019.\n\nSince the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan's agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said.\n\nIn March, eyewitnesses told CNN that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \"enlist or die.\" The RSF denied this claim.\n\nLast year, CNN also reported on an RSF-led campaign of enslavement and other atrocities by the paramilitary group and its allied militias in Sudan's western Darfur region - an area already scarred by what has been widely described as the 21st century's first genocide.\n\nAl-Tahir Ibrahim Al-Khair, the governor of Al-Jazira, condemned the RSF's brutal actions. In a statement via state news agency SUNA, he described these actions as \"war crimes\" and called for international condemnation and accountability.\n\nMore than 7.1 million people have been internally displaced in Sudan since the start of the civil war in April 2023, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a report on Thursday.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also reported that more than 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million people need assistance since the war's outbreak.\n\nLast week, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu warned at the UN Security Council, \"The situation today bears all the marks of risk of genocide, with strong allegations that this crime has already been committed.\"\n\nCNN's Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

on Wednesday, according to a local lobby group.\n\nThe Madani Resistance Committee said in a statement on social media that the RSF pounded the Wad al-Noura village killing dozens in the farming state that it captured in December 2023.\n\nThe statement said the incident in the village was a full-scale massacre carried out by the RSF, while the army remained \"stationary inside Al-Manaqil locality.\"\n\n\"Wad Alnoura village ... witnessed a genocide on Wednesday after the RSF attacked twice, killing up to 100 people,\" the group said, and a video showed the burial of dozens of victims in a public square.\n\nThe RSF said on Wednesday it had attacked army and allied militia bases around Wad Alnoura but did not acknowledge any civilian casualties, according to a statement seen by Reuters news agency.\n\nBut the Wad Madani Resistance Committee accused it of using heavy artillery against civilians, looting, and driving women and children to seek refuge in the nearby town of Managil.\n\nThe paramilitary group is also accused of assassinating journalist Muawiya Abdel Razzaq and three of his family members late Tuesday night at their home in the Al-Droshab suburb, in the capital Khartoum.\n\n\"In a crime that adds to the record of the criminal militia, four young men from southern Al-Droshab were executed inside their home late last night: Tarek Yaqub, Murtada Captain, Ali Turki, and journalist Muawiya Abdel Razzaq,\" said a local resident on Facebook, as seen by Sudan Tribune news site.\n\nAn official of Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) in Sudan's besieged El Fasher city, describes the situation as catastrophic due to intense fighting between the Sudanese army and paramilitary RSF.\n\nMSF Project Coordinator in El Fasher, Abdi-Fattah Yousif Ibrahim said the city has been under constant shelling since the war started in May, and every corner of the city is being bombarded.\n\n\"Today in El Fasher, nowhere is safe due to the shelling, including hospitals,\" Yousif said in an audio statement published on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHe said MSF-supported hospitals were targeted and hit multiple times, where several people died, others got injured, and damage was caused to critical infrastructures in the facilities.\n\nEl-Fasher, the last remaining capital of the Darfur region still in the hands of the Sudanese army, has witnessed fierce fighting as the RSF is pressing deeper seeking to take control, Al Jazeera news reported.\n\nThe RSF paramilitary group besieged the city early this month and launched a major attack on its southern and eastern parts.\n\nOn May 26, the organization said at least 134 people were killed including its staff member in two weeks of fighting between the Sudanese army and Rapid Support Force in El Fasher.\n\nMSF added that its staff had treated 979 casualties at the city's main hospital since the fighting began.\n\nSudan's powerful military commanders, junta leader General Abdal Fattah Al Burhan and RSF's General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, plunged the country into a brutal conflict in April 2023 following a longstanding rivalry.\n\nWhile much of the early fighting took place around the capital Khartoum, it quickly spread to other parts of the country, including the southwestern state of Darfur.", "source": {"uri": "eyeradio.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eye Radio"}, "authors":

village, activists say", "body": "Port Sudan, Sudan - A Sudanese pro-democracy activists' committee Thursday reported 'more than 104' dead in a single day when paramilitary forces attacked a village, as the UN warned of mass displacement and starvation.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been at war with the regular army since April 2023, on Wednesday attacked the central village of Wad al-Noura in al-Jazira state 'in two waves' with heavy artillery, the Madani Resistance Committee said.\n\nIt reported on Wednesday that the feared paramilitaries had 'invaded the village', causing dozens of casualties and widespread displacement.\n\nThe attack 'claimed the lives of more than 104 martyrs' and 'injured hundreds' said the committee, one of hundreds of similar grassroots groups across Sudan, adding that it reached the toll via 'initial communication with village residents'.\n\nOn social media, the committee shared footage of what it said was a 'mass grave' in the public square, showing rows of white shrouds laid out in a courtyard.\n\nIn a little over a year, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, including up to 15,000 in a single West Darfur town.\n\nHowever, the war's overall death toll remains unclear, with some estimates of up to 150,000, according to US special envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello.\n\nThe RSF has repeatedly besieged and attacked entire villages across the country, and has been notorious for widespread looting as well as sexual and ethnic violence.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, the RSF said it had attacked three army camps in the Wad al-Noura area, and clashed with its enemy 'outside the city'.\n\nThe resistance committee called the RSF's statement an 'expected' attempt to 'criminalise the people of Wad al-Noura and label them a legitimate target'.\n\nIt also said the villagers had 'called for help from the armed forces, which did not respond'.\n\nThe military has not issued an official comment, but Sudan's ruling sovereignty council, under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, called Wednesday's attack a 'heinous massacre of defenceless civilians.'\n\nThe army has come under repeated criticism from Sudanese civilians for 'abandoning' them and retreating in the face of RSF offensives, particularly in al-Jazira and the western Darfur region.\n\nBoth the army and the RSF - commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo - have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians, indiscriminately shelling residential areas and looting or obstructing humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Emergency Lawyers, a pro-democracy group of volunteers who document the war's atrocities, said Thursday the attack on Wad al-Noura was a 'war crime' and called on the international community to 'exert pressure' on both sides to abide by international law.\n\n'Looming famine'\n\nThe UN migration agency warned Thursday that internal displacement figures in Sudan could 'top 10 million' within days.\n\nSince the war began, more than seven million people have fled their homes for other parts of Sudan, adding to 2.8 million already displaced from previous conflicts in the war-torn country of 48 million inhabitants.\n\n'The world's worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,' the International Organization for Migration said in a statement.\n\nAcross Sudan, 70 percent of those displaced 'are now trying to survive in places that are at risk of famine', it added.\n\nThe UN says 18 million people in Sudan are acutely hungry, with 3.6 million children acutely malnourished.\n\nWidespread hunger has haunted the country for months, while aid agencies say a lack of data has prevented the official declaration of a famine.\n\nIf the current humanitarian situation continues, 2.5 million people could die of hunger by the end of September, according to recent estimates by the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.\n\nThat figure is 'about 15 percent of the population in Darfur and Kordofan,' the country's vast western and southern regions which have seen some of the worst fighting, the institute said.\n\nThe UN has accused both sides of 'systematic obstructions and deliberate denials' of humanitarian access.", "source": {"uri": "kenyastar.com", "dataType": "news",

says at least 104 killed in village attack - War in Sudan - World", "body": "The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been at war with the regular army since April 2023, on Wednesday attacked the central village of Wad al-Noura in al-Jazira state \"in two waves\" with heavy artillery, the Madani Resistance Committee said.\n\nIt reported on Wednesday that the feared paramilitaries had \"invaded the village\", causing dozens of casualties and widespread displacement.\n\nThe attack \"claimed the lives of more than 104 martyrs\" and \"injured hundreds\" said the committee, one of hundreds of similar grassroots groups across Sudan, adding that it reached the toll via \"initial communication with village residents\".\n\nOn social media, the committee shared footage of what it said was a \"mass grave\" in the public square, showing rows of white shrouds laid out in a courtyard.\n\nIn a little over a year, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, including up to 15,000 in a single West Darfur town.\n\nHowever, the war's overall death toll remains unclear, with some estimates of up to 150,000, according to US special envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello.\n\nThe RSF has repeatedly besieged and attacked entire villages across the country, and has been notorious for widespread looting as well as sexual and ethnic violence.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, the RSF said it had attacked three army camps in the Wad al-Noura area, and clashed with its enemy \"outside the city\".\n\nThe resistance committee called the RSF's statement an \"expected\" attempt to \"criminalise the people of Wad al-Noura and label them a legitimate target\".\n\nIt also said the villagers had \"called for help from the armed forces, which did not respond\".\n\nThe military has not issued an official comment, but Sudan's ruling sovereignty council, under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, called Wednesday's attack a \"heinous massacre of defenceless civilians\".\n\nThe army has come under repeated criticism from Sudanese civilians for \"abandoning\" them and retreating in the face of RSF offensives, particularly in al-Jazira and the western Darfur region.\n\nBoth the army and the RSF -- commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo -- have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians, indiscriminately shelling residential areas and looting or obstructing humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Emergency Lawyers, a pro-democracy group of volunteers who document the war's atrocities, said Thursday the attack on Wad al-Noura was a \"war crime\" and called on the international community to \"exert pressure\" on both sides to abide by international law.\n\nThe UN migration agency warned Thursday that internal displacement figures in Sudan could \"top 10 million\" within days.\n\nSince the war began, more than seven million people have fled their homes for other parts of Sudan, adding to 2.8 million already displaced from previous conflicts in the war-torn country of 48 million inhabitants.\n\n\"The world's worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,\" the International Organization for Migration said in a statement.\n\nAcross Sudan, 70 per cent of those displaced \"are now trying to survive in places that are at risk of famine\", it added.\n\nThe UN says 18 million people in Sudan are acutely hungry, with 3.6 million children acutely malnourished.\n\nWidespread hunger has haunted the country for months, while aid agencies say a lack of data has prevented the official declaration of a famine.\n\nIf the current humanitarian situation continues, 2.5 million people could die of hunger by the end of September, according to recent estimates by the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.\n\nThat figure is \"about 15 per cent of the population in Darfur and Kordofan\", the country's vast western and southern regions which have seen some of the worst fighting, the institute said.\n\nThe UN has accused both sides of \"systematic obstructions and deliberate denials\" of humanitarian access.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg",

The number of victims exceeds 150 people, including children, women and the elderly,\" Minawi said in a post on X.\n\nFootage shared on social media, and geolocated by CNN, shows a large crowd in Wad Al-Noura village surrounding dozens of dead bodies, shrouded in white, as preparations were being made for their burial.\n\nAnother video allegedly shows the RSF militia firing heavy and medium weapons towards the village.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the exact number of casualties.\n\nThe RSF claimed in a statement Wednesday they launched a preemptive attack on Sudanese Army (SAF) camps in Wad Al-Noura in response to a planned attack by the army.\n\nAccording to the RSF, eight of its fighters were killed, others injured, and they seized vehicles, weapons, and military equipment during the operation.\n\nThey did not acknowledge the civilian deaths reported in the statement shared on social media platform, X.\n\nThe Transitional Sovereignty Council condemned the RSF's actions, describing them as part of a systematic campaign of violence against civilians. \"This heinous crime is added to the series of crimes committed by this rebel militia in many states of Sudan. These are criminal acts that reflect the systematic behavior of these militias in targeting civilians, plundering their property, and forcibly displacing them from their areas,\" the Council said.\n\nThe council, headed by junta leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is the governing body that has ruled Sudan since former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019.\n\nAllegations of massacres\n\nSince the conflict started, both the Sudanese army and the RSF have faced damning accusations of civilian massacres. The RSF has specifically targeted villages in Al-Jazira, Sudan's agricultural heartland, to swell its ranks through forced conscription and using hunger as a weapon, eyewitnesses have said.\n\nIn March, eyewitnesses told CNN that more than 700 people, including dozens of children, were forcibly recruited from the state by the militia group after being ordered to \"enlist or die.\" The RSF denied this claim.\n\nLast year, CNN also reported on an RSF-led campaign of enslavement and other atrocities by the paramilitary group and its allied militias in Sudan's western Darfur region - an area already scarred by what has been widely described as the 21st century's first genocide.\n\nAl-Tahir Ibrahim Al-Khair, the governor of Al-Jazira, condemned the RSF's brutal actions. In a statement via state news agency SUNA, he described these actions as \"war crimes\" and called for international condemnation and accountability.\n\nMore than 7.1 million people have been internally displaced in Sudan since the start of the civil war in April 2023, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a report on Thursday.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also reported that more than 8.8 million people have fled their homes, and 24.8 million people need assistance since the war's outbreak.\n\nLast week, United

Condemnations of the attack poured in from various Sudanese political and civil bodies and figures.\n\nA resident of Wad El Nura told Radio Dabanga that the death toll has \"so far reached 107 people\". The Wad Madani Resistance Committees confirmed this on their Facebook page, adding that they \"have yet to count all the bodies\".\n\nA video and pictures shared by the Wad Madani Resistance Committees showed villagers assembling in a public square in Wad El Nura around scores of bodies ready for burial en masse.\n\nWitnesses said that the RSF targeted the village with heavy weapons. A video shared by the Wad Madani Resistance Committees showed men, some in RSF uniform, in Land Cruisers mounted with DShk (Dushka) machine guns firing towards Wad El Nura.\n\nThe RSF acknowledged the attack, claiming in a statement on their official X account that they \"targeted three camps of Islamist forces in the region who were preparing to attack the RSF.\" They added that \"El Burhan militia and the Mujahidin brigades mobilised large forces\" with the aim of attacking RSF positions. \"Our forces will not stand idly by in the face of any enemy movements or gatherings\", the statement says.\n\nCondemnations\n\nThe Transitional Sovereignty Council, led by Sudan de-facto leader and Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) Commander-in-Chief Abdelfattah El Burhan, called on the international community and human rights organisations to denounce the massacre and hold its perpetrators accountable, emphasising the principle of no impunity. In a statement yesterday, the council said that this crime is \"one of many committed by the RSF, targeting civilians, their property, and forcibly displacing them\".\n\nA number of political parties and civil society organisations condemned the massacre. The Sudanese Congress Party condemned the massacre and called for the RSF to cease what it described as \"heinous crimes since its occupation of El Gezira\". The party's statement, posted yesterday on its X (formerly Twitter) account, noted that the operation led to the death of more than 100 people and the plundering of civilian property.\n\nThe Minister of Finance and head of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), Jibril Ibrahim, denounced the Wad El Nura massacre, stating that it was \"impossible to coexist with people who kill, plunder, and rape as they are\".\n\nThe National Umma Party (NUP) strongly condemned what it described as a \"bloody, unprovoked attack on the innocent residents of Wad al-Noura,\" holding the RSF fully responsible and appealing for an end to attacks on villages and the endangerment of civilians.\n\nThe Darfur Bar Association (DBA) condemned the massacre \"in the strongest terms.\" In a statement yesterday, it expressed fear of an outbreak of civil war in the country, declaring full solidarity with the people of Wad al-Noura and other affected villages in the state of El Gezira. The DBA called on the world community to take the necessary measures to stop the war, halt human massacres, and prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nThe Coordination of Khartoum Resistance Committees condemned the massacre as \"another crime in the RSF's record of committing crimes against humanity,\" describing it as genocide and forced displacement against the residents of El Gezira's villages.\n\nThe Professional Pharmacists Association (PPA) described the massacre as a continuation of the RSF's longstanding approach of targeting civilians through killing, looting, and displacement. The group called on the Sudanese people to \"defend themselves.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Minni Minawi, the governor of Darfur and leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement - Minawi faction (SLM-MM), asked what the world is waiting for after the killing of more than \"150 women, children, and the elderly\" in Wad al-Noura, questioning why countries supporting the RSF are not taking action.", "source":

It broke out after months of tension over details of the country's democratic transition boiled over.\n\nThe conflict has killed about 150,000 people, according to some estimates, and displaced nearly nine million people. It has also drawn charges of war crimes against both the army and the RSF, and created a massive humanitarian crisis in which millions are on the brink of famine.\n\nThe RSF front-runner is the notorious Janjaweed militia, which fought on the side of the government during the 2000s conflict in Darfur that left at least 300,000 dead and displaced another 2.5 million.\n\nThe militia and government forces stand accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in that conflict, with ousted dictator Omar Al Bashir indicted with others by the International Criminal Court more than a decade ago.\n\nThe Arab-led RSF has also been accused of killing thousands of ethnic Africans in Darfur last summer.

Nearly five million people in the country are close to famine as Sudan's civil war passes the one-year mark.\n\nSince the war began, over seven million people have fled their homes for other parts of Sudan, adding to 2.8 million already displaced from previous conflicts in the war-torn country of 48 million inhabitants.\n\n'The world's worst internal displacement crisis continues to escalate, with looming famine and disease adding to the havoc wrought by conflict,' the International Organization for Migration said in a statement.\n\nAcross Sudan, 70 percent of those displaced 'are now trying to survive in places that are at risk of famine,' it added.\n\nThe U.N. says 18 million people are acutely hungry, with 3.6 million children acutely malnourished.\n\nWidespread hunger has haunted Sudan for months, while aid agencies say a lack of data has prevented the official declaration of a famine.\n\nIf the current humanitarian situation continues, 2.5 million people could die of hunger by the end of September, according to recent estimates by the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.\n\nThat figure is 'about 15 percent of the population in Darfur and Kordofan,' the country's vast western and southern regions which have seen some of the worst fighting, the institute said.\n\nThe U.N. has accused both sides of 'systematic obstructions and deliberate denials' of humanitarian

The latest atrocity comes as the capital, Khartoum, lies in ruins, and 5 million people are at risk of famine.\n\nOn Wednesday, RSF fighters opened fire on residents of Wad Al Noura village, just south of Khartoum, after they tried to stop the group from entering the area, the Madani Resistance Committee, a local pro-democracy organization, said in a statement.\n\nIt put the death toll at \"as many as 100\" people including women and children, and shared pictures and videos online showing dozens of bodies wrapped in white shawls.

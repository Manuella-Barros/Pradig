By this point, the fire had started to burn through the roof of the plane and only at the request of the fire services did the pilots power down the engines.\n\nAfter this, however, there was no further communication from the cockpit and none of the emergency doors were ever opened. The fire engulfed the plane and gutted the fuselage.\n\nAccident investigators believe that lives could have been saved if the plane had been brought to an immediate stop on the runway and an evacuation immediately ordered.", "source": {"uri": "paddleyourownkanoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddle Your Own Kanoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mateusz_maszczynski@paddleyourownkanoo.com", "name": "Mateusz Maszczynski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_slide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evacuation slide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landing gear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A330"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia_Flight_163", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudia Flight 163"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_Khan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacha Khan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-1011_TriStar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed L-1011 TriStar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide poisoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_officer_(aviation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First officer (aviation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cockpit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight recorder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Saudi-evacuation.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724091", "eventUri": "eng-9724091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

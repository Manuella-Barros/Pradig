John Swinney\n\nHe did so after conceding he would need to \"reach out to others to make things happen, to pass legislation, to agree a budget\".\n\nMr Swinney told the other parties at Holyrood: \"If we want to fund our schools and hospitals, if we want to give our businesses a competitive edge, if we want to take climate action, if we want to eradicate child poverty, if we want to change people's lives for the better, we have got to work together to do so.\"\n\nBut he said he would \"give all of my energy and my willingness\" to achieve this, committing to be \"the first minister for everyone in Scotland\".\n\nMr Swinney told Scots: \"I am here to serve you.

SNP had previously looked to the \"extreme Greens\" for policies, while at the same time \"continuing the push for the same old tired campaign for independence and a referendum\".\n\nMr Ross said Mr Swinney must \"swiftly change course\" from that and \"deliver a bold new policy agenda\".\n\nHe urged the new SNP leader to rule out \"any agreement, by the backdoor or otherwise\" with the Scottish

He voiced 'profound and eternal gratitude' that she was willing to make sacrifices so he could serve Scotland.\n\nAttention will now turn to his Cabinet, with questions over whether Kate Forbes will be handed the key post as his deputy amid tensions over her devout Christian views. Appointments will happen after he is sworn in tomorrow.\n\nDespite swipes that he is a 'Sturgeon apologist' and 'continuity' option, Mr Swinney was the only SNP leadership candidate running when nominations closed yesterday.\n\nHe managed to convince former finance secretary Ms Forbes to join his team rather than challenge him, in a move billed a 'stitch-up' by opponents.\n\nJohn Swinney is set to be installed as Scottish First Minister after being confirmed as the new SNP leader yesterday\n\nIn a valedictory speech at Holyrood this afternoon, Humza Yousaf thanked colleagues who had shown him 'kindness' amid the 'toxic nature of our political debate'\n\nHumza Yousaf officially quit as Scottish First minister today paving the way for John Swinney to be installed within hours\n\nMr Swinney won the backing of 64 MSPs, with his nearest rival Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross picking up 31. As the Greens abstained that was enough for a simple majority.\n\nPitching for the role in the chamber, Mr Swinney said: 'I hope we can all recognise that despite our political differences, we're all here because we want the best for Scotland, whatever our specific role happens to be.\n\n'For me, it is with all my experience - but with much more than that - with my burning ambition for a better future for this country, that I am seeking to become first minister.'\n\nHe said his 'core belief' is that 'Scottish self-government is the right way forward for Scotland'.\n\nHe pledged to listen to those who voted for pro-independence parties in 2021 as well as those who did not.\n\nMr Yousaf said in his final speech: 'Let me offer thanks to every single colleague across the political divide for the kindnesses that you have shown me over the years.\n\n'We often, and I'm guilty of this too, lament the toxic nature of our political debate and it's true, there is entrenched tribalism that feels difficult to free ourselves from.\n\n'However I will remember far more fondly the kindness and generosity of colleagues over the years.'\n\nMr Swinney swerved a late obstacle yesterday as he persuaded activist Graeme McCormick not to go ahead with forcing a leadership contest, even though he had secured the support required to stand.\n\nIn his victory speech in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Swinney acknowledged the scale of the infighting and crises which have engulfed the SNP and admitted the party has been through a 'rough, tough time'.\n\nBut he claimed that his party has now 'come back together again' under his leadership and 'got our act together'.\n\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney would just 'double down on the independence obsession' rather than tackling Scotland's problems.\n\n'It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate,' he said.\n\n'John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\n\n'The stitch-up the SNP have engineered to ensure John Swinney's coronation highlights the mess they're in.\n\n'Is a failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables - really the best they have to offer?\n\nMr Yousaf's time as First Minister was spent dealing with a long list of crises, including developments in the police probe into the SNP's funding and finances, a series of policy U-turns, disciplinary issues, defections and bitter infighting between factions in his party.\n\nIn his speech yesterday, Mr Swinney claimed the speedy leadership process can allow the SNP to 'get back on the front foot'.\n\nA Norstat poll at the weekend showed the SNP is on course to fall to just 15 seats following the general election, and to slide behind Labour at the next Holyrood election.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election was seen as dropping to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nMr Swinney was the only nominee for SNP leader after he persuaded former Finance Secretary Kate Forbes (pictured) to join his team rather than challenge him\n\nMr Yousaf's fall from grace was sparked when he summarily ditched the coalition deal with the Greens in Scotland\n\nMr Yousaf signed his resignation letter to the King as the transition takes effect\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times survey, the SNP had support from 29 per cent of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34 per cent.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16 per cent in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8 per cent, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: 'John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country.\n\n'At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.'", "source":

The first minister is now expected to appoint his cabinet, in a series of meetings at his official residence, Bute House.His appointments will be confirmed in parliament on Thursday.Big tensions remain in SNP as John Swinney takes leadershipWill John Swinney change the SNP's fortunes?After the ceremony, Mr Swinney, 60, told reporters it was an \"enormous privilege\", but said it had been a \"very abrupt\" change for his family.\"It's an extraordinary opportunity to change lives for the better and I intend to use every moment that is available to me to do so,\" he said.He vowed his minority SNP administration government would seek to work collaboratively across parliament, with a particular focus on eradicating the \"curse\" of child poverty. Last week he promised a senior role to the former finance secretary Kate Forbes, who declined to challenge him for the leadership of the SNP.The ceremony to install Mr Swinney as first minister was overseen by Scotland's senior judge, Lord Carloway.The Perthshire North MSP swore the oath of office, declared his allegiance to the King and was confirmed as keeper of the Scottish Seal.He confirmed his appointment by putting pen to parchment on a table in the well of the court, Scotland's supreme body for civil law since 1532. PA MediaMr Swinney won the nomination for first minister in a parliamentary vote on Tuesday.He was backed by all 63 SNP MSPs and Alba's sole Holyrood representative, Ash Regan. Seven Green MSPs abstained, guaranteeing Mr Swinney the required majority.Following a tumultuous two weeks for the SNP, Mr Swinney became party leader on Monday.A contest was narrowly avoided, with a rival candidate - veteran SNP activist Graeme McCormick - withdrawing his bid at the 11th hour. This paved the way for Humza Yousaf to formally resign as first minister on Tuesday - a move prompted by his tearing up of the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens. He had been in post for just over a year, having taken over the role from Nicola Sturgeon.Jane BarlowMr Swinney has 16 years' cabinet experience and led the SNP between 2000 and 2004.He will take office in the week the Scottish Parliament marks 25 years since devolution.Previously, he said he would not be an \"interim leader\" or a \"caretaker\" and that he intended to see out a full term.He has said he will seek to govern on a \"moderate centre left\" platform, and will be open to working with any other political party in the parliament to pass legislation.This was reflected in his speech to MSPs on Tuesday in which he struck a conciliatory note, praising the achievements of other major parties in the devolved parliament.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.He pledged to be the \"first minister for everyone in Scotland\", adding: \"I am here to serve you, I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country.\"The economy, the NHS and other public services, and \"a drive to lift children out of poverty\" are his priorities for government.While Ms Forbes is expected to make a return to cabinet but it is unclear where other ministerial roles will be allocated.PA MediaIt is also not clear which roles Mr Swinney will keep, though The Times previously reported he intended to have a \"slimmed-down\" government.Having confirmed he has no intention of resurrecting a deal with the Greens, Mr Swinney will attempt to pass a budget and other key bills with a minority administration of 63 MSPs.Until recently Mr Swinney's career on the frontbenches looked to be over.He stepped down from the cabinet in 2023 after 16 years in key roles under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon.Following the collapse of the Bute House Agreement, and Mr Yousaf's resignation, Mr Swinney was publicly urged to stand for first minister by senior party members - which he said he accepted out of a \"profound sense of duty\".The SNP leader said the decision had been made with his family, expressing \"eternal gratitude\" to his wife Elizabeth Quigley, who has multiple sclerosis and relies on him for support.Related TopicsScottish governmentScotlandJohn SwinneySNP leadership contest 2024SNP (Scottish National Party) ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews

Although the SNP is two seats short of a majority, Mr Swinney emerged with the most votes, clearing the way for his formal appointment at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Wednesday morning.\n\nAttention will shift in the afternoon to the cabinet reshuffle that Mr Swinney is expected to implement. Kate Forbes, the former finance secretary who has sat on the backbenches since losing a bitter leadership contest with Mr Yousaf last year, is expected to return to a frontline role.\n\nMs Forbes, a social conservative who is also seen as one of the most capable politicians in the party, was widely viewed as Mr Swinney's biggest rival for the leadership when Mr Yousaf quit. She considered making a leadership bid during a period of high drama in Scottish politics last week, but decided to stand aside and back Mr Swinney after talks between the two. He has promised her a \"significant role\" in his government.\n\nMr Swinney, a party veteran who was previously SNP leader two decades ago, has promised to unite the party after a fractious 14 months since the resignation of former leader Nicola Sturgeon, who has since become embroiled in a financial scandal. After 17 years in power, the SNP's support has also slipped in the polls with Labour resurgent north of the Scottish border with England.\n\nIn a Holyrood speech during the debate to confirm his nomination as first minister, Mr Swinney acknowledged that as leader of a minority administration, he will need to \"reach out to others to make things happen\".\n\nHe praised Labour and the Liberal Democrats on Tuesday for their governance of Scotland during the early years of devolution in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He also praised the Conservative Party for its role in opposition.\n\nIn a sign that Alex Salmond's nationalist Alba party may also be prepared to back him on certain issues, it appeared its sole member of parliament, Ash Regan, voted for Mr Swinney in the first minister vote.\n\nMr Yousaf ended the SNP's previous government arrangement with the Scottish Greens, whom many in the SNP blame for dragging the government to the left with policies unpopular with some voters. The Scottish Greens abstained in the vote for first minister, but indicated they may back Mr Swinney on individual policies on a case-by-case basis.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType":

His allies were desperate to avoid a contest following the sudden resignation of Mr Yousaf.\n\nHer appointment was also intended to signal that Mr Swinney is serious about trying to drag the SNP back to the political centre ground after the end of its power-sharing agreement with the hard-Left Greens.\n\nMs Forbes has previously expressed \"significant concerns\" about the SNP-Green coalition's self-ID gender reforms, environmental policies and income tax hikes.\n\nBut the Scottish Tories said that, apart from Ms Forbes, Mr Swinney had unveiled \"Humza Yousaf's Cabinet with a different figurehead\". They said her appointment was intended to \"gloss over the huge splits in the SNP.\"\n\nThe Greens also reacted with hostility to Ms Forbes's appointment. Patrick Harvie, their co-leader and a minister in Mr Yousaf's government, posted on social media a picture of a road sign stating \"No right turn\".\n\nImmensely talented politician\n\nMr Swinney announced his Cabinet after being sworn in as First Minister at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, with Ms Forbes the first SNP MSP to arrive at his Bute House official residence.\n\nAs the most powerful member of Mr Swinney's administration, other than the First Minister himself, she is in pole position to succeed him if the 60-year-old stands down after the 2026 Scottish Parliament election.\n\nHe said: \"I am very pleased to appoint Kate as Deputy First Minister and look forward to working with her in this new government.\n\n\"She is an immensely talented politician, and her new role will prove critical as we focus on our key commitments of eradicating child poverty, investing in public services and supporting economic growth.\"\n\nA devout Christian, she triggered uproar in last year's SNP leadership contest with Mr Yousaf when she expressed opposition to gay marriage and children being born out of wedlock.\n\nMr Swinney questioned at the time whether her views made her \"an appropriate individual to be SNP leader and first minister.\"\n\nBut he rejected the Green accusations that Ms Forbes' appointment as his deputy meant he had lurched to the Right, saying the SNP would remain a Centre-Left party.\n\nSpeaking alongside Ms Forbes outside Bute House, he also denied that LGBT Scots should be concerned, saying he would be \"the First Minister for everyone\".\n\nShona Robison had earlier resigned as Deputy First Minister, writing to Mr Swinney that Ms Forbes should have the post \"to unite the party behind your leadership.\"\n\nHowever, she retained her position as Finance Secretary despite widespread hostility to this year's Scottish Budget, in which she introduced a sixth income tax band.\n\nMr Swinney also kept Jenny Gilruth at education, Neil Gray at health, Angela Constance at justice, Mairi McAllan at net zero and energy, Fiona Hyslop at transport and Shirley-Anne Somerville at social justice.\n\nIn addition, Angus Robertson remained Constitution and Culture Secretary and Mairi Gougeon Rural Affairs Secretary after serving in the same posts in Mr Yousaf's crisis-hit government.\n\nMr Swinney said he had \"selected a Cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my government will pursue - eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services\".\n\nMs Forbes said: \"I am deeply honoured to accept John's invitation to be his Deputy First Minister.\n\nMore of the same\n\n\"This is a moment of extraordinary privilege for me. Having previously served in Cabinet, I know the duty that all Ministers have to reflect the government's priorities and the missions that drive them.\"\n\nShe will also take on responsibility for Gaelic.\n\nBut Craig Hoy, the Scottish Tory chairman, said: \"This uninspiring cabinet is further evidence that John Swinney as First Minister will just mean more of the same.\"\n\nJackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's deputy leader, said: \"After 17 years of failure, every single institution in Scotland is now weaker and those responsible remain at the heart of government.\n\n\"This is a continuity Cabinet that cannot be trusted to fix the chaos and instability they have created.\"\n\nMr Harvie said: \"There will be many people across our country who will be very concerned and who will want to know that this Scottish Government remains committed to a greener and more equal future for Scotland.\"\n\nMr Swinney also had a phone call with the Prime Minister in which he pledged to \"work constructively with the UK Government in a good-faith effort to deliver for the people of Scotland and reduce polarisation in politics\".\n\nA Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The First Minister made clear that the Scottish Government will continue to respectfully persuade people in Scotland of the case for independence, and that the decision on Scotland's future should be for the people of Scotland to make.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_johnson@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Simon Johnson",

It's an extraordinary opportunity to change lives for the better and I'll continue to use every moment that's available to me to do so,\" he said.\n\n\"For my family this is a very abrupt change of our circumstances. We didn't think this would happening about 10 days ago,\" he added.\n\nSwinney, who was deputy first minister under Nicola Sturgeon, previously said he is \"no interim leader\" and intends to lead the SNP beyond the next general and Scottish elections.\n\nHe has vowed to focus on the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the NHS, education, public services, and the climate crisis.\n\nAddressing the opposition, he said, \"If we want to fund our schools and hospitals, if we want to give our businesses a competitive edge, if we want to take climate action, if we want to eradicate child poverty, if we want to change people's lives for the better, we have got to work together to do so.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Swinney has appointed the 34-year-old Kate Forbes as deputy first minister.\n\nKate Forbes, the former finance secretary, stepped aside last week allowing Swinney to stand unopposed for the SNP's leadership.", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"},

"title": "John Swinney is installed as Scottish First Minister after SNP chaos", "body": "John Swinney was officially installed as Scottish First Minister today after Humza Yousaf quit.\n\nThe new SNP leader was elected to the post in a Holyrood vote, with the Greens ensuring he could not be blocked.\n\nThe confirmation came hours after Mr Yousaf signed his resignation letter to the King, and gave a valedictory speech slamming 'bigots'.\n\nMr Swinney becomes the third holder of the top role in barely a year.\n\nAttention will now turn to his Cabinet, with questions of whether Kate Forbes will be handed the key post as his deputy amid tensions over her devout Christian views.\n\nDespite swipes that he is a 'Sturgeon apologist' and 'continuity' option, Mr Swinney was the only candidate running when nominations closed yesterday.\n\nHe managed to convince former finance secretary Kate Forbes to join his team rather than challenge him, in a move billed a 'stitch-up' by opponents.\n\nJohn Swinney is set to be installed as Scottish First Minister after being confirmed as the new SNP leader yesterday\n\nIn a valedictory speech at Holyrood this afternoon, Humza Yousaf thanked colleagues who had shown him 'kindness' amid the 'toxic nature of our political debate'\n\nHumza Yousaf officially quit as Scottish First minister today paving the way for John Swinney to be installed within hours\n\nMr Yousaf signed his resignation letter to the King as the transition takes effect\n\nMr Yousaf's fall from grace was sparked when he summarily ditched the coalition deal with the Greens in Scotland\n\nMr Yousaf said in his final speech: 'Let me offer thanks to every single colleague across the political divide for the kindnesses that you have shown me over the years.\n\n'We often, and I'm guilty of this too, lament the toxic nature of our political debate and it's true, there is entrenched tribalism that feels difficult to free ourselves from.\n\n'However I will remember far more fondly the kindness and generosity of colleagues over the years.'\n\nMr Swinney swerved a late obstacle yesterday as he persuaded activist Graeme McCormick not to go ahead with forcing a leadership contest, even though he had secured the support required to stand.\n\nIn his victory speech in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Swinney acknowledged the scale of the infighting and crises which have engulfed the SNP and admitted the party has been through a 'rough, tough time'.\n\nBut he claimed that his party has now 'come back together again' under his leadership and 'got our act together'.\n\nScottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said Mr Swinney would just 'double down on the independence obsession' rather than tackling Scotland's problems.\n\n'It's difficult to see how he can be the fresh start Scotland needs, when he's the ultimate continuity candidate,' he said.\n\n'John Swinney was joined at the hip with the disgraced Nicola Sturgeon and his fingerprints are all over her numerous policy failures and cover-ups.\n\n'The stitch-up the SNP have engineered to ensure John Swinney's coronation highlights the mess they're in.\n\n'Is a failed former leader from two decades ago - who, as education secretary, sent Scotland plummeting down international league tables - really the best they have to offer?\n\nMr Yousaf's time as First Minister was spent dealing with a long list of crises, including developments in the police probe into the SNP's funding and finances, a series of policy U-turns, disciplinary issues, defections and bitter infighting between factions in his party.\n\nIn his speech yesterday, Mr Swinney claimed the speedy leadership process can allow the SNP to 'get back on the front foot'.\n\nA Norstat poll at the weekend showed the SNP is on course to fall to just 15 seats following the general election, and to slide behind Labour at the next Holyrood election.\n\nThe SNP vote share in a Westminster election was seen as dropping to its lowest level since the 2014 independence referendum.\n\nThe party would hold just 15 of its 43 seats with Scottish Labour winning 28 - a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nMr Swinney was the only nominee after he persuaded former Finance Secretary Kate Forbes (pictured) to join his team rather than challenge him\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times survey, the SNP had support from 29 per cent of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34 per cent.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16 per cent in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8 per cent, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: 'John Swinney's coronation is entirely about managing the SNP rather than running our country.\n\n'At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

the 60-year-old faced a vote at Holyrood to confirm him as Humza Yousaf's successor.\n\nThe Scottish Greens abstained from the vote, with Mr Swinney able to fend off challenges from Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.\n\nHis name will now be submitted to the King, with an official swearing-in ceremony expected to take place at the Court of Session in Edinburgh as early as Wednesday.\n\nMr Swinney will then be able to appoint his cabinet.\n\nMr Yousaf was forced to step down last week in the face of two votes of no confidence after terminating the power-sharing Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens.\n\nDuring his final speech as first minister, Mr Yousaf said his heart would \"forever belong to Scotland\" as he told how leading his country had given him the opportunity to defy \"racist bigots\".\n\nHe said: \"Young Humza Yousaf could never have imagined he would be able to lead this country.\n\n\"I was six-years-old when I was first told to go home, and I am afraid since then it has been a regular occurrence - in fact, almost daily if you look at my social media feeds.\"\n\nHe said that \"racial slur\" had hurt him most \"simply because I have no other home than this one, I never will, I never have\".\n\nMr Yousaf continued: \"My heart will forever belong to Scotland.\n\n\"So, to have the opportunity to defy the far-right, to defy the racist bigots who told me to go home, to be in a position to serve my home, to contribute to public life in my home, and to have the opportunity to lead my home - that has been the most tremendous honour that I didn't think was reserved for people who looked like me.\"\n\nMr Swinney was unopposed in the SNP leadership contest and promised a \"new chapter\" for the party as he pledged to use \"respect and courtesy\" to make the case for Scottish independence.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho is John Swinney?\n\nFormer finance secretary Kate Forbes had been tipped to join the race, but instead threw her support behind him.\n\nMr Swinney previously said he would want Ms Forbes to \"play a significant part\" in his government if elected.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Listen above then tap here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts \ud83d\udc48\n\nResponding to questions after his post-win speech on Monday, Mr Swinney confirmed he will not be reinstating the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, preferring to take issues on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBefore the vote took place for a new first minister, the Scottish Greens announced its MSPs would be abstaining.\n\nParty co-leader Lorna Slater stated although the SNP is the largest party at Holyrood and has the right to form a government, \"it does not have an automatic right to our votes\".\n\nShe added: \"We need to see what vision the first minister has for Scotland and what direction he wants to take.\"\n\nMs Slater said her party would work \"positively and constructively\" and would \"not indulge in opposition for its own sake or political gameplaying\".\n\nShe added: \"We will aim to work with and support the Scottish government on an issue-by-issue basis.\n\n\"We will back them when they are delivering progressive policies that protect our environment and help to tackle child poverty, and we will oppose them or push them to go further and raise their ambitions when we think they need it.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Having previously served in Cabinet, I know the duty that all ministers have to reflect the Government's priorities and the missions that drive them,\" she added.\n\n\"Because if some people are beyond the pale, then those are dark and dangerous days for Scotland,\" added Ms. Forbes.\n\nEarlier this week Labour's leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, said: \"At a time when Scotland is crying out for change, the SNP is offering more of the same. John Swinney has been at the heart of this incompetent government for 17 years and at the heart of the SNP for 40 years.\"\n\nThe next elections to the Scottish Parliament are not until 2026.",

to \"working constructively\" with Swinney \"on the real issues that matter to families - delivering jobs, growth and better public services for people across Scotland\".\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in the devolved parliament in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and education.\n\nThe party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence referendum since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in 2014.\n\nDespite the SNP slumping in the polls since Sturgeon quit in March last year, support for independence continues to hover around 40 percent, giving the party cause for hope.\n\nThe SNP holds 63 seats in the 129-member Scottish Parliament, two short of a majority, meaning Swinney will need the support of other parties to pass legislation.\n\nHe has said he will not resurrect the defunct power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens and will approach issues

I offer myself to be the First Minister for everyone in Scotland. I am here to serve you. I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country.\"\n\nEx-First Minister and former SNP chief Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the new FM.\n\nShe posted to X: \"I have worked closely with John Swinney for more than 30 years.\n\n\"He was by my side throughout my time as FM - as deputy, friend and confidante.\n\n\"He is one of the kindest and most decent people I know - and without doubt, the right person to be FM in this moment, for both party and country.\n\n\"Aside from his family, I doubt there is anyone in Scotland prouder of John today than I am. I wish him all the luck in the world.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said in Parliament: \"I know that the First Minister, given his long career in cabinet, will be acutely aware of that burden and that the decision to take up that role will not have been as easy one for him.\n\n\"And so, I wish him well in taking on that burden. I also want to say how rightly proud his family must be today.\n\n\"We all know the strain elected office has on our families but that is magnified ten-fold, when the politician holds the office of First Minister.\n\n\"So on behalf of the Scottish Conservatives, we offer strength and support to the entire Swinney family as they provide the personal backing that will be so important to our First Minister.\n\n\"I hope that he will lead a government not for just one side of the constitutional argument but for all of Scotland.\n\n\"Because a government acting in the national interests is what the Scottish people deserve.\n\n\"Yet it is what the SNP have failed to deliver for the last three years.\n\n\"The legislative achievements of this session are few and far between and that looks unlikely to change.\n\n\"Instead, we saw an SNP Government, having ran out of its own ideas, increasingly look for policy direction from the extreme Greens.\n\n\"While continuing to push the same old, tired campaign for independence and a referendum.\n\n\"John Swinney must swiftly change course and deliver a bold new policy agenda for this SNP Government instead of treading water like his predecessors have done.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_williamson@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Harry Williamson", "type":

He is expected to reshuffle his cabinet soon after that, with Kate Forbes - who narrowly lost to Yousaf in last year's leadership contest and agreed to back Swinney after private talks week - likely to take a leading position.\n\nIn his pitch to MSPs, Swinney - who must now govern from a minority position after Yousaf unilaterally axed the governing partnership with the Scottish Greens last week, precipitating his downfall - struck an ameliorative tone, noting the 25th anniversary of the Scottish parliament and praising other parties for their contribution over the years.\n\nOpposition leaders pointed to Swinney's involvement in past Scottish government failures - he is one of the SNP's most experienced politicians and previously served as leader from 2000 to 2004. Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, accused the SNP of \"replacing one continuity candidate with another\" while Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar called for an early Holyrood election.\n\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater questioned whether Swinney would \"retreat to the middle ground\" by ditching the policy programme previously agreed between the SNP and her party, including rent controls and a ban on conversion practices, adding that \"our door remains open\" for future collaboration.\n\nThe outgoing first minister, Humza Yousaf, made an emotional final statement in which he thanked MSPs for the opportunity \"to defy the far right, bigots and racists\" who had told him to \"go home\" throughout his life.\n\n\"I have no other home than this one,\" Yousaf, the first Muslim to hold the post, told MSPs. \"I never will, I never have.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "libby_brooks@theguardian.com", "name": "Libby

His nomination was backed by the SNP's 64 MSPs, while the seven Greens abstained, giving him the required majority.\n\nThe 60-year-old, who was previously SNP leader between 2000 and 2004, will be sworn in as First Minister at the Court of Session on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe will then unveil his new Cabinet, with a prominent role expected for Kate Forbes after she agreed to his pleas not to stand against him for the party leadership, meaning he did not face a contest.\n\nIt is a remarkable comeback for Mr Swinney, who was deputy first minister in Ms Sturgeon's government and stepped down from the Scottish Cabinet in tandem with her in March last year.\n\nIt had been assumed his career in frontline politics was over but Mr Yousaf's ignominious fall from power, after he botched his decision to end his power-sharing deal with the Greens, left the SNP in crisis.\n\nIn a speech to MSPs following his election as First Minister, he admitted it was \"something of a surprise\" to accept the office and said that eradicating child poverty would be his government's priority.\n\nHe admitted he would lead a minority administration that needed the votes of other parties and noted the Scottish Parliament is \"intensely polarised at this time.\"\n\nTo laughter, Mr Swinney said: \"I accept my part in creating that environment - whether that is by shouted put-downs from the front bench or heckling from a sedentary position. I do promise, Presiding Officer, that will all stop - I have changed.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that Holyrood was divided on independence but asked: \"Does our disagreement on the constitution prevent us from working collaboratively within the existing powers of the parliament to eradicate child poverty, build the economy, support jobs, address the cost of living crisis, improve the health service and tackle the climate crisis?\n\n\"I will give all of my energy, and my willingness to engage and listen, to ensure that is not the case. I invite others to do the same.\"\n\nMr Yousaf's 'most prominent supporter'\n\nMr Swinney also paid tribute to his wife Elizabeth, who has multiple sclerosis and was watching from the gallery, saying he wanted to express his \"profound eternal gratitude for the sacrifices she is prepared to make to enable her husband to serve our country as First Minister.\"\n\nMr Ross noted Mr Swinney had been Alex Salmond's Finance Secretary, Ms Sturgeon's deputy and Mr Yousaf's \"most prominent supporter\".\n\n\"Scotland waits to see whether he will be a nationalist leader, like his predecessors, or a national leader that Scotland needs to take our country forward,\" Mr Ross said.\n\nAlister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, congratulated Mr Swinney but said: \"He needs to put aside his obsession with independence, and concentrate on contributing to a thriving Scotland within a strong United Kingdom.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"I have worked closely with John Swinney for more than 30 years. He was by my side throughout my time as FM - as deputy, friend and confidante.\n\n\"He is one of the kindest and most decent people I know - and without doubt, the right person to be FM in this

I've changed.\"\n\nHe said: \"This is not the collaborative place it has been in the past.\"\n\nIn a vote at Holyrood, Mr Swinney won the backing of 64 MSPs, with his nearest rival Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross picking up 31. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar secured 22 votes, with the head of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Alex Cole-Hamilton, winning four. The seven Scottish Green MSPs abstained.\n\nMr Swinney, who got up from his seat on the front bench to shake hands with every opposition leader after his speech, questioned whether \"our disagreement on the constitution prevent us from working collaboratively within the existing powers of the parliament to eradicate child poverty, build the economy, support jobs, address the cost of living crisis, improve the health service and tackle the climate crisis\".\n\nHe added: \"I will give all of my energy, and my willingness to engage and listen, to ensure that is not the case. I invite others to do the same.\"\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP pointed to \"a focus on the economy, our National Health Service and public services\" as well as \"a drive to lift children out of poverty\".\n\nDespite his pledge to work with unionist parties, Mr Swinney insisted that \"Scottish self-government is the right way forward for Scotland\" through independence.\n\nMr Swinney claimed that ending the Union would \"equip this parliament with the powers it needs to match the success of those comparable independent states\". He added that independence would provide \"more resources for our National Health Service\" and \"the opportunity to grow our economy free from a broken Westminster economic model\".\n\nHe added: \"Both those who are against independence and those who are in favour deserve to be heard through dialogue, debate and deliberation.\n\n\"I believe it's possible to argue respectfully our different positions.\"\n\nIn accepting the nomination to become the next First Minister, Mr Swinney paid thanks to his family, watching in the Holyrood gallery, particularly his wife Elizabeth who has multiple sclerosis.\n\nHe acknowledged he had taken time to talk over whether taking on the top job was right for his family, concluding that \"we will manage\".\n\nMr Swinney added that he has \"profound eternal gratitude for the sacrifices she is prepared to make to enable her husband to service our country as First Minister\".\n\nMr Ross also pointed to the \"strain\" being an elected politician has have on families, stressing \"that is magnified tenfold when the politician holds the office of first minister\".\n\nHe said his party would \"offer our strength and support to the entire Swinney family\".\n\nBut Mr Ross warned that Mr Swinney's government \"cannot just serve one side of the constitutional argument\", adding that \"it must deliver for the whole of Scotland\".\n\nThe Tory leader claimed that \"the legislative achievements of this session (of parliament) are few and far between\". He accused Mr Swinney's predecessors of having \"run out of its own ideas\", and borrowed \"policy ideas from the extreme Greens\".\n\nHe said: \"John Swinney must swiftly change course and deliver a bold, new policy agenda for the SNP government instead of treading water like his predecessors.\"\n\nMr Ross called on Mr Swinney to \"reach beyond a nationalist coalition to compromise and find consensus in this parliament\".\n\nBut he added that the \"key to delivering that would be putting the campaign for independence on the backburner\" and treat him taking the keys to Bute House \"as a reset moment\".\n\nThe Scottish Labour leader also appeared to back more collaboration, calling on Mr Swinney to \"work across this chamber in a way that has sadly escaped his predecessors\".\n\nMr Sarwar added: \"We will continue to work constructively when we can and promote the national interest.\"\n\nBut Mr Sarwar claimed that the SNP has been \"one of the architects of divisive politics\".\n\nHe added: \"I do now question the rhetoric and the pretense of them now somehow being the great unifiers of our nation.\"\n\nThe Labour leader called for \"an end to the incompetence in managing our public services\".\n\nMr Swinney has indicated a shift away from SNP governments being propped up by the Scottish Greens. Mr Yousaf's move to tear up the Bute House Agreement signalled the end of his premiership and has prompted the first minister in waiting to appeal to unionist opponents instead.\n\nCo-leader of the Scottish Greens, Lorna Slater, said that despite the end of her party's co-operation agreement with the government, \"there was so much work still to be completed\", highlighting plans for rent controls and decarbonising how buildings are heated and demands for a \"water-tight ban on conversion therapy\".\n\nShe called on Mr Swinney to \"lay out whether the government will continue with these progressive policies\" or \"retreat to the middle ground\" and \"rely on the Tories\" for support.\n\nMs Slater added: \"Our door remains open.\"\n\nNicola Sturgeon, who was first minister when Mr Swinney served as deputy, wished him \"all the luck in the world\".\n\nWriting on X, formerly known as Twitter, she added: \"I have worked closely with John Swinney for more than 30 years. He was by my side throughout my time as FM - as deputy, friend and confidante.\n\n\"He is one of the kindest and most decent people I know - and without doubt the right person to be FM in this moment, for both party and country.\n\n\"Aside from his family, I doubt there is anyone in Scotland prouder of John today than I am.\"\n\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack said: \"I would like to congratulate John Swinney on being elected First Minister of Scotland.\n\n\"I hope that he will prioritise the issues that really matter to people in Scotland, like improving failing public services and growing our economy. I want him to work constructively with the UK government on our joint projects to boost Scotland's prosperity - including freeports, city deals and investment zones.\n\n\"Most of all, I hope that Mr Swinney will govern for the whole of Scotland. He needs to put aside his obsession with independence, and concentrate on contributing to a thriving Scotland within a strong United Kingdom.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news",

I've changed.\"\n\nHe said: \"This is not the collaborative place it has been in the past.\"\n\nIn a vote at Holyrood, Mr Swinney won the backing of 64 MSPs, with his nearest rival Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross picking up 31. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar secured 22 votes, with the head of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Alex Cole-Hamilton, winning four. The seven Scottish Green MSPs abstained.\n\nMr Swinney, who got up from his seat on the front bench to shake hands with every opposition leader after his speech, questioned whether \"our disagreement on the constitution prevent us from working collaboratively within the existing powers of the parliament to eradicate child poverty, build the economy, support jobs, address the cost of living crisis, improve the health service and tackle the climate crisis\".\n\nHe added: \"I will give all of my energy, and my willingness to engage and listen, to ensure that is not the case. I invite others to do the same.\"\n\nThe Perthshire North MSP pointed to \"a focus on the economy, our National Health Service and public services\" as well as \"a drive to lift children out of poverty\".\n\nDespite his pledge to work with unionist parties, Mr Swinney insisted that \"Scottish self-government is the right way forward for Scotland\" through independence.\n\nMr Swinney claimed that ending the Union would \"equip this parliament with the powers it needs to match the success of those comparable independent states\". He added that independence would provide \"more resources for our National Health Service\" and \"the opportunity to grow our economy free from a broken Westminster economic model\".\n\nHe added: \"Both those who are against independence and those who are in favour deserve to be heard through dialogue, debate and deliberation.\n\n\"I believe it's possible to argue respectfully our different positions.\"\n\nIn accepting the nomination to become the next First Minister, Mr Swinney paid thanks to his family, watching in the Holyrood gallery, particularly his wife Elizabeth who has multiple sclerosis.\n\nHe acknowledged he had taken time to talk over whether taking on the top job was right for his family, concluding that \"we will manage\".\n\nMr Swinney added that he has \"profound eternal gratitude for the sacrifices she is prepared to make to enable her husband to service our country as First Minister\".\n\nMr Ross also pointed to the \"strain\" being an elected politician has have on families, stressing \"that is magnified tenfold when the politician holds the office of first minister\".\n\nHe said his party would \"offer our strength and support to the entire Swinney family\".\n\nBut Mr Ross warned that Mr Swinney's government \"cannot just serve one side of the constitutional argument\", adding that \"it must deliver for the whole of Scotland\".\n\nThe Tory leader claimed that \"the legislative achievements of this session (of parliament) are few and far between\". He accused Mr Swinney's predecessors of having \"run out of its own ideas\", and borrowed \"policy ideas from the extreme Greens\".\n\nHe said: \"John Swinney must swiftly change course and deliver a bold, new policy agenda for the SNP government instead of treading water like his predecessors.\"\n\nMr Ross called on Mr Swinney to \"reach beyond a nationalist coalition to compromise and find consensus in this parliament\".\n\nBut he added that the \"key to delivering that would be putting the campaign for independence on the backburner\" and treat him taking the keys to Bute House \"as a reset moment\".\n\nThe Scottish Labour leader also appeared to back more collaboration, calling on Mr Swinney to \"work across this chamber in a way that has sadly escaped his predecessors\".\n\nMr Sarwar added: \"We will continue to work constructively when we can and promote the national interest.\"\n\nBut Mr Sarwar claimed that the SNP has been \"one of the architects of divisive politics\".\n\nHe added: \"I do now question the rhetoric and the pretense of them now somehow being the great unifiers of our nation.\"\n\nThe Labour leader called for \"an end to the incompetence in managing our public services\".\n\nMr Swinney has indicated a shift away from SNP governments being propped up by the Scottish Greens. Mr Yousaf's move to tear up the Bute House Agreement signalled the end of his premiership and has prompted the first minister in waiting to appeal to unionist opponents instead.\n\nCo-leader of the Scottish Greens, Lorna Slater, said that despite the end of her party's co-operation agreement with the government, \"there was so much work still to be completed\", highlighting plans for rent controls and decarbonising how buildings are heated and demands for a \"water-tight ban on conversion therapy\".\n\nShe called on Mr Swinney to \"lay out whether the government will continue with these progressive policies\" or \"retreat to the middle ground\" and \"rely on the Tories\" for support.\n\nMs Slater added: \"Our door remains open.\"\n\nNicola Sturgeon, who was first minister when Mr Swinney served as deputy, wished him \"all the luck in the world\".\n\nWriting on X, formerly known as Twitter, she added: \"I have worked closely with John Swinney for more than 30 years.

I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country,\" he told MSPs after accepting the nomination.\n\nSwinney, an old party hand who led the ruling pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, was elected unopposed as leader of the SNP on Monday.\n\nHe is seen as an experienced operator able to reach across the political divide, which is key to the SNP being able to rule as a minority government.\n\nSwinney must also unite his divided party, split between those on the left supportive of trans rights and urgent climate action and members on the right wanting to focus on issues such as health and the economy.\n\nHe has said that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence, he wants to eradicate child poverty.\n\nBut he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape.\n\n- Resurgent Labour -\n\nThe SNP is expected to lose several seats in the UK parliament to a resurgent Labour party at a general election due later this year.\n\nThe SNP currently holds 43 seats at Westminster. Labour hopes a comeback in its former stronghold of Scotland will help it win an outright majority in the nationwide vote.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he looked forward to \"working constructively\" with Swinney \"on the real issues that matter to families -- delivering jobs, growth and better public services for people across Scotland\".\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in the devolved parliament in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and education.\n\nThe party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence vote since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in a referendum in 2014.\n\nBut despite the SNP slumping in the polls since Sturgeon quit in March last year, support for independence continues to hover around the 40 percent mark, giving the party cause for hope.\n\nThe SNP holds 63 seats in the 129-member Scottish parliament, two short of a majority, meaning Swinney will need the support of other parties to pass legislation.\n\nHe has said he will not resurrect the defunct power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement, and will approach issues on a case-by-case basis.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nThe new First Minister assembled his Cabinet hours after being officially sworn into the post at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and after he spoke to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nSpeaking after his top team was announced, Mr Swinney said he is \"committed to working collaboratively across the Parliament to address the pressing issues facing the people of Scotland\".\n\nThat will be required as the SNP is now a minority administration at Holyrood after Mr Yousaf tore up the powersharing deal the party had with the Scottish Greens - a move which ultimately led to his resignation as first minister.\n\nMr Swinney's Cabinet includes eight women - thought to be the most ever - and two other men.\n\nNeil Gray, who was appointed Health Secretary earlier this year, stays in the post, while Angus Robertson remains Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Secretary.\n\nShona Robison, who had been deputy first minister under Mr Yousaf, loses that position but remains in the Cabinet - keeping her finance brief and also taking on responsibility for local government.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney stands with his newly appointed Cabinet on the steps of Bute House (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nFormer teacher Jenny Gilruth remains Education Secretary, Angela Constance retains her position as Justice Secretary, and Fiona Hyslop continues as Transport Secretary.\n\nMairi McAllan remains in the Cabinet but with a slightly slimmed down brief - she had been the net zero, wellbeing economy and energy secretary, but now has responsibility for net zero and energy.\n\nShirley-Anne Sommerville and Mairi Gougeon also continue in their previous roles - as Social Justice Secretary, and Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands Secretary respectively.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I have selected a Cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my Government will pursue - eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services.\n\n\"My overriding priority will be to work to eradicate child poverty in Scotland, an issue on which real progress has been made through measures such as the Scottish child payment.\n\nNew Scottish First Minister John Swinney, with his wife Elizabeth Quigley and their son Matthew,13.

I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country,\" he told MSPs after accepting the nomination.\n\nSwinney, an old party hand who led the ruling pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, was elected unopposed as leader of the SNP on Monday.\n\nHe is seen as an experienced operator able to reach across the political divide, which is key to the SNP being able to rule as a minority government.\n\nSwinney must also unite his divided party, split between those on the left supportive of trans rights and urgent climate action and members on the right wanting to focus on issues such as health and the economy.\n\nHe has said that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence, he wants to eradicate child poverty.\n\nBut he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape.\n\nThe SNP is expected to lose several seats in the UK parliament to a resurgent Labour party at a general election due later this year.\n\nThe SNP currently holds 43 seats at Westminster. Labour hopes a comeback in its former stronghold of Scotland will help it win an outright majority in the nationwide vote.\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he looked forward to \"working constructively\" with Swinney \"on the real issues that matter to families -- delivering jobs, growth and better public services for people across Scotland\".\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in the devolved parliament in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and education.\n\nThe party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence vote since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in a referendum in 2014.\n\nBut despite the SNP slumping in the polls since Sturgeon quit in March last year, support for independence continues to hover around the 40 percent mark, giving the party cause for hope.\n\nThe SNP holds 63 seats in the 129-member Scottish parliament, two short of a majority, meaning Swinney will need the support of other parties to pass legislation.\n\nHe has said he will not resurrect the defunct power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens, known as the Bute House Agreement, and will approach issues on a case-by-case basis.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

attention will turn to cabinet ministers", "body": "Although the conclusion of the uncontested SNP leadership campaign yesterday marked the coronation of John Swinney as the new party leader, and next first minister of Scotland, his predecessor Humza Yousaf actually remained first minister until today.\n\nYousaf, first minister for just over a year, held his final cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning following which - as the rules of Holyrood dictate - he signed his formal letter of resignation to King Charles.\n\nThe acceptance of which by the head of state marks the exact moment at which he ceases to be the first minister.\n\nWhen that is accomplished Scotland technically has no first minister, but this is not a situation which will last long as MSPs are expected to vote on Tuesday afternoon to accept Swinney as the new first minister.\n\nBarring a last-minute unforeseen upset, Swinney will be elected as first minister with the support of the Scottish Greens, and will then lead a minority SNP government.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney to be Scotland's next first minister after Holyrood vote\n\nThe vote is scheduled to take place at 3 pm, and most of the opposition parties are likely to nominate their preferred candidate, each of whom will be called in alphabetical order to address the Chamber for up to five minutes.\n\nOnly Swinney has any chance of garnering sufficient votes to be elected as first minister, and if all goes well he will be elected as first minister by teatime.\n\nAfter winning the vote in Holyrood he will then attend the Court of Session to swear the oath of office, upon the completion of which formality he officially becomes Scotland's first minister.\n\nThe debate and vote will, as has become traditional, be marked by ill-tempered bad behaviour from a Scottish Tory contingent which has become significantly more boorish since Douglas Ross ousted Jackson Carlaw in a coup de prat, and by Anas Sarwar and his resting sneer face.\n\nJohn Swinney and Humza Yousaf share a hug before the vote for the next first minister\n\nBut all that is just so much theatrics for all that it's likely to generate a soundbite or two which will be eagerly seized upon by an anti-independence Scottish media which has just been deprived of the bitterly contested SNP leadership campaign that it had been looking forward to with such obvious relish.\n\nAttention will then switch to the announcement of Swinney's new cabinet.\n\nGreat heed will be paid to the post offered to former finance secretary Kate Forbes, Swinney's putative leadership rival, and flag bearer of the right of the party.\n\nThe two held meetings after Humza Yousaf stepped down following which Forbes put out a statement in which she spoke of the constructive and productive nature of the talks, praising her erstwhile rival, and announcing that she would be supporting Swinney as SNP leader and first minister.\n\nFor his part, Swinney sang Forbes' praises during the speech at which he officially launched his leadership bid and vowed to give her a prominent role in his new government.\n\nThere is speculation that Forbes will be offered either the post of finance secretary or deputy first minister when the new cabinet posts are announced.\n\nThe anti-independence parties are of course making their ritual calls that the new first minister abandon the 'distraction' of pursuing Scottish independence.\n\nHowever, the question of independence is not a 'distraction' in Scottish politics it is the central and defining issue of Scottish politics.\n\nIndependence is not a distraction from tackling poverty, climate change, the housing crisis, the ageing workforce or all the myriad of other issues which affect Scotland.\n\nIndependence is the key to unlocking the powers required to deal with them effectively and to find lasting solutions.\n\nREAD MORE: Tearful Humza Yousaf calls out 'daily' racism in final leader speech\n\nThe real distraction is pretending that the issue of independence must not be addressed, that's like saying a patient needs to take a paracetamol while ignoring a ruptured artery.\n\nThe truth is that the root cause of most of Scotland's economic, demographic, and political challenges is generations of Westminster misrule and until that is addressed nothing of substance will ever change.\n\nIndependence is an issue which is not going to go away no matter how much the Labour, Conservative, and Lib Dem parties wish it would.\n\nThe irony is that the power is entirely with the anti-independence parties to make the Scottish constitutional issue go away, they could do so by removing their election-denying undemocratic block on a second independence referendum.\n\nBut of course, we all know why they're not going to do that, and it's because they know that there is a very high chance that they could lose.\n\nIt is abundantly clear by now that the Labour, Conservative, and Lib Dem parties will only respect the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland as expressed through the ballot box when the people give them the result that they want.\n\nSo naturally they accepted the no vote in the 2014 independence referendum but found various ruses and excuses to explain away the result of the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary election which was fought on the central issue of a second independence referendum, and which produced a Scottish Parliament with its largest ever pro-independence majority.\n\nIt is to the lasting shame of the anti-independence media in Scotland that it not merely allowed the election denial of the Better Together parties to pass without serious challenge, but it actively colluded in enabling it.\n\nHowever, the immediate challenge facing the new first minister will be to unite the SNP and to bring some stability to his party after a torrid and at time, upsetting year.\n\nSwinney is perhaps the best-placed SNP politician to achieve that.\n\nHis task is to bring together the different factions within the SNP and to refocus the party on its core purpose, persuading the people of Scotland of the vital importance of Scottish independence and putting forward a plausible route to achieve it.\n\nIt will not be an easy task, and time is rapidly running out with a Westminster general election expected within the next few months and a resurgently and far more overtly right-wing

With no referendum imminent, opposition parties criticised the publications as a waste of taxpayers' money. The 13th in the series, on justice in an independent Scotland, was published last month.\n\nAlyn Smith MP, the Scottish National party's Europe spokesperson at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that \"all of our government ministers are focused on independence in Europe\".\n\nSwinney said on Monday when he became the SNP leader that he wanted to persuade people of the case for independence by creating a \"vibrant economy\" and tackling challenges across public services.\n\nThe announcement came as part of Swinney's limited cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday. After being sworn in as first minister at the court of session, he appointed Kate Forbes as his deputy. The former finance secretary stepped aside to allow Swinney to stand unopposed for the SNP leadership.\n\nForbes, who narrowly lost to Yousaf in last year's leadership election to replace Nicola Sturgeon, is a social conservative who split the party when she disclosed she would not have voted for equal marriage. She has also been critical of the stalled gender recognition reform bill, which was passed with cross-party support at Holyrood, then blocked by Westminster.\n\nRelated: Making John Swinney leader may be the SNP's smartest move in years | Dani Garavelli\n\nAsked on Wednesday if she had a message for LGBTQ+ people after her return to cabinet, Forbes said she would support Swinney in \"finding places of consensus\".\n\nSwinney also brought back Ivan McKee, a key ally of Forbes and a respected business communicator, as minister for public finance. Emma Roddick, the minister tasked with guiding the bill to ban conversion practices through Holyrood, returns to the backbenches.\n\nPatrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens co-leader, accused Swinney during first minister's questions of sending a message to voters the Scottish government was now moving rightwards with Forbes's appointment.\n\n\"Yesterday that signal came pretty clearly: progressive ministers sacked and the second most powerful job in government given to someone who has opposed LGBT people's legal equality, who's expressed judgmental attitudes against abortion, and who's even expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong,\" Harvie said, in reference to Forbes.\n\n\"Is this the Scottish government's vision for the future of Scotland, taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s?\"\n\nSwinney rejected that attack, insisting his government would \"will be led from the moderate left of centre position that I have always occupied\".\n\nPressed again by Harvie, Swinney told MSPs: \"I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, a place for everybody. Where everybody feels at home, at peace, that they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday, Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens' co-leader, said her party was experiencing a \"surge\" in membership, \"particularly people in the LGBTQ+ community are now looking at the SNP and thinking: 'Oh my goodness, is this really the home for me?'.\"\n\nSmith said\"Scotland's a big tent but we're too small a community to exclude people, and people of faith should have a role in politics.\" He said Forbes' position on equalities issues was \"a matter for her to work through her conscience\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

As the Greens abstained that was enough for a simple majority.\n\nAfterwards he said: 'I am leading a minority government. I will need to reach out to others to make things happen to pass legislation to agree a budget.'\n\nHe said Holyrood was 'intensely polarised', adding: 'I accept my part in creating that environment, whether that is by shouting put-downs from the front bench or heckling from a sedantry position.\n\n'I do promise Presiding Officer, that that will all stop.

a dramatic increase from its current two.\n\nHumza Yousaf officially quit as Scottish First minister yesterday paving the way for Mr Swinney to be installed\n\nMr Yousaf's fall from grace was sparked when he summarily ditched the coalition deal with the Greens in Scotland\n\nMr Yousaf signed his resignation letter to the King as the transition took effect\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times survey, the SNP had support from 29 per cent of the electorate - a fall of three points in a month, while Labour's share increased by two points to 34 per cent.\n\nUnder Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP became the third largest party at Westminster, winning 56 of 59 Scottish seats in 2015.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives, whose vote share remained at 16 per cent in the poll, would add three seats to return nine MPs - while the Liberal Democrats, on 8 per cent, would boost their yield by one to five MPs.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Session", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Court of Session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presiding_Officer_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/08/10/84603641-0-image-m-24_1715160738576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It turned out that continuity was the last thing Scotland needed: continued failure to deliver on schools, hospitals, the economy and ferries.\n\nBut now the new First Minister, John Swinney, has rubber-stamped the Cabinet bequeathed to him by his predecessor. There are only two new faces, and both were ministers until Mr Yousaf became First Minister.\n\nThe first, rather obviously, is Mr Swinney himself. The other is Kate Forbes, who has been rewarded by her new boss for not plunging the SNP into another divisive leadership contest so close to an expected UK general election. She becomes Deputy First Minister - the youngest person ever to hold the post - and has been given the portfolio of Economy Secretary.\n\nIt's a canny move by Mr Swinney, even if he had to humiliate Shona Robison, the previous Deputy First Minister and finance secretary, by giving her most important title to Ms Forbes; after running Mr Yousaf a close second in last year's SNP leadership contest (Ms Forbes lost by a narrow 4 per cent margin), there was much criticism of the new First Minister when he offered his defeated rival the rural affairs brief, presumably knowing she would recognise it as the demotion it was and turn it down.\n\nJohn Swinney after being sworn in yesterday\n\nBut Mr Swinney has been in this game too long to make the same stupid mistake. He needs Ms Forbes on board if he is to persuade the country - and his party - that the SNP are once again united.\n\nYet given the seismic events of the past fortnight - Mr Yousaf's unforced error in unilaterally ending the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens, his subsequent realisation that he would lose the vote of no confidence laid before Holyrood by the Scottish Conservatives, and his humiliating resignation statement a couple of days later - more of the same is the last thing Scotland needs.\n\nFrom the outside it looks like Mr Swinney has concluded that, since everything in the Scottish Government is going so splendidly, why bother making big changes?\n\nOrdinary Scots might have good reason to feel bemused at such a conclusion. Parents of school-age children, for example, have little reason to welcome the announcement that Jenny Gilruth, the Education Secretary, remains in post, our new First Minister having written 'ten out of ten' on her jotter.\n\nExcept, Scottish education standards are on the slide, falling ever further behind in international league tables and the much-vaunted Curriculum for Excellence is failing to prepare Scottish youngsters academically.\n\nAt health, Mr Swinney has given Neil Gray the thumbs-up and told him he should stay in post, despite one in seven Scots still languishing on one NHS waiting list or another.\n\nIf Mr Gray is the best person for this most crucial of jobs, it places a worrying question mark over the abilities of more junior, ambitious ministers and backbench nationalist MSPs.\n\nMeanwhile, the First Minister has given the green light to 'Airmiles Angus' Robertson, the cabinet secretary for a whole range of things that Holyrood has no responsibility for, including the constitution and external (or foreign) affairs. Mr Robertson has enjoyed his role of visiting other countries and spreading the gospel of independence while relying on the UK Foreign Office to make all the arrangements for his ego-flattering trips.\n\nIt seems that despite Mr Swinney's insistence on working with a range of opposition parties, he is happy to further erode relations with the UK Government by letting Mr Robertson flout diplomatic rules on behalf of his party.\n\nOne of the losers in this reshuffle is Energy and Net Zero Minister M\u00e0iri McAllan, whose responsibility for the economy has been given to Ms Forbes. She has committed her fair share of gaffes in her short ministerial career, recently welcoming Mr Swinney's candidacy for the leadership of her party as 'the right man for the moment', rather than 'the man of the moment' - which made it sound like the new First Minister was destined, like his predecessor, to be a temporary stopgap until a better leader came along.\n\nLast year, she caused much hilarity among her party's critics by suggesting that 'more often than not world leaders are approaching the Scottish Government asking for our advice on how we have managed to lead the way so successfully on a number of fronts'.\n\nUnfortunately, Ms McAllan was then unable to explain who these unfortunate world leaders were.\n\nWith these political titans ready to carry on business as usual, we may assume that the Scottish Government's own legislative agenda will be similarly unchanged and just as uninspiring.\n\nAll eyes will be on two key pieces of legislation: a Bill tackling misogyny and a ban on conversion therapy. Both are fraught with danger for the First Minister.\n\nHis predecessor has already confirmed that men, as well as women, will come under the protection of the new anti-misogyny Bill, provided they claim to be women themselves.\n\nThis raises an interesting problem: the new Deputy First Minister is a member of the Free Church of Scotland and is known to be sceptical of her party's agenda on trans rights under both Mr Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nOne of Mr Swinney's first acts as putative SNP leader was to avoid answering the question as to whether trans women (biological males) are women, which trans ideology holds to be the case.\n\nMs Forbes will lose much of her own credibility if she goes along with the party line on this sort of cultural issue, and Mr Swinney may be keen to avoid any sort of showdown with her.\n\nAnd this raises another problem for the SNP.\n\nPatrick Harvie, one of the two junior Scottish Green ministers unceremoniously sacked by Mr Yousaf a fortnight ago, reacted to Ms Forbes's elevation to the post of Deputy First Minister by tweeting a 'no right turn' sign.\n\nMr Harvie and his Scottish Greens co-leader, Lorna Slater, were only too happy to work with Ms Forbes, despite her personal views, when she held the powerful finance portfolio under Ms Sturgeon.\n\nBut now the bitterness of their treatment by the party - and the fact that Mr Swinney has already ruled out any possibility of the Bute House Agreement being resurrected - looks set to be a major barrier to the small, extremist party offering its support to this minority SNP government.\n\nMr Swinney has surveyed the problems besetting Scotland, and he has decided that everything is fine and that no major changes are required.\n\nThat is his privilege.\n\nHowever, history does not look kindly on political leaders who are so out of touch that their attitude becomes: 'Crisis? What crisis?'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type":

The Scottish political veteran, said it was \"something of a surprise\" to find himself taking the top job at his stage of his career, but added it was \"an extraordinary privilege\".\n\n\"I am here to serve you.

largely unchanged Cabinet but Forbes returns as his deputy", "body": "Kate Forbes has become Scotland's youngest ever Deputy First Minister as John Swinney announced a largely unchanged Cabinet team.\n\nMs Forbes, 34, a former Holyrood finance secretary, had been tipped to run for the SNP leadership again after Humza Yousaf stood down just over a week ago, but she instead opted to back Mr Swinney and he went on to claim the position of party leader unopposed.\n\nHe has now rewarded her by making her his deputy, and also giving her responsibility for the economy and Gaelic.\n\nBy giving such a key role to Ms Forbes, a critic of some Scottish Government policies who had been on the backbenches during Mr Yousaf's time in charge, Mr Swinney will hope to ease internal tensions within the SNP.\n\nSpeaking after his top team was announced, Mr Swinney said he is \"committed to working collaboratively across the Parliament to address the pressing issues facing the people of Scotland\".\n\nThat will be required as the SNP is now a minority administration at Holyrood after Mr Yousaf tore up the powersharing deal the party had with the Scottish Greens - a move which ultimately led to his resignation as first minister.\n\nMr Swinney's Cabinet includes eight women - thought to be the most ever - and two other men.\n\nNeil Gray, who was appointed Health Secretary earlier this year, stays in the post, while Angus Robertson remains Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Secretary.\n\nShona Robison, who had been deputy first minister under Mr Yousaf, loses that position but remains in the Cabinet - keeping her finance brief and also taking on responsibility for local government.\n\nMairi McAllan remains in the Cabinet but with a slightly slimmed down brief - she had been the net zero, wellbeing economy and energy secretary, but now has responsibility for net zero and energy.\n\nShirley-Anne Sommerville and Mairi Gougeon also continue in their previous roles - as Social Justice Secretary, and Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands Secretary respectively.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I have selected a Cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my Government will pursue - eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services.\n\n\"My overriding priority will be to work to eradicate child poverty in Scotland, an issue on which real progress has been made through measures such as the Scottish child payment.\n\nMs Forbes said she was \"deeply honoured\" to be appointed as his deputy, describing it as an \"extraordinary privilege\".\n\nShe added: \"I look forward to working with John and Cabinet colleagues, delivering for the people of Scotland and building a better country.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier on Wednesday after he was sworn into office at the Court of Session, Mr Swinney had said: \"It's a really overwhelming moment to take the oath of office in front of the Lord President of the Court of Session and formally assume the role of First Minister.\n\n\"I look forward to dedicating my future to serving the people of Scotland.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary opportunity to change lives for the better and I'll continue to use every moment that's available to me to do so.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

He moved to end any bad blood between Ms Forbes and senior SNP figures by offering her a return to cabinet role at a one-on-one meeting last week.\n\nMs Forbes was asked about the same-sex marriage controversy, and if she had any message to the LGBT community, as she took questions alongside Ms Swinney outside Bute House in Edinburgh after the new cabinet was named.\n\nShe said her job as Deputy First Minister was now to support Mr Swinney in \"uniting the country\" and \"finding those places of consensus\".\n\nMr Swinney - who had previously questioned whether it was \"appropriate\" for someone with her views on gay marriage to lead the party - said: \"I will be the first minister for everyone in Scotland, whether those people are in the LGBT community or not.\"\n\nSNP MP Douglas Chapman told the move to bring Ms Forbes into the fold was \"really good news\". The Forbes backer said he hoped she can \"move the dial\" when it comes to the SNP's policy agenda and electoral fortunes. \"She has the ability to win people over through her actions, as opposed to rhetoric,\" he added.\n\nMSP Ivan McKee, another Forbes supporter, told he was \"delighted\" that she was now party of the party's hierarchy. He said she could make a \"significant contribution to the success of the SNP [and] the wider independence movement\".\n\nOne senior SNP source, a Swinney backer, said there had been some concerns that Ms Forbes will alienate left-wing voters in Scotland, but they hope the new deputy leader can separate her religious views from policy.\n\nAnother SNP Swinney ally said most were happy that Ms Forbes has accepted such a senior job, and would mean that she would stand fully behind the government. \"John wants to use all the talents at his disposal,\" they told .\n\nAndy McIver, former Scottish Tory media chief, told : \"It's a big deal. It's a big call for Swinney, because there would have been some opposition internally. She won't be a trophy Deputy First Minister. You can bet your bottom dollar she is going to have a big say.\"\n\nHe added: \"She is popular with the people who like to drive in the middle lane, like most of us. They've been dismayed with the Scottish Government hanging about on the left, and they'll now - at the very least - take another look.\"\n\nGeoff Aberdein, Alex Salmond's former chief of staff, said polling which shows the SNP slipping behind Labour in Scotland had \"focused minds\". He told : \"If the SNP wants to retain seats you need to be seen to speak to all parts of the country.\"\n\nThe co-host of Holyrood Sources podcast added: \"I'm certain she will help shape the direction of the government - she will have negotiated hard on that. She will want to change things. Otherwise she will be associated with what has been a mediocre government of late.\"\n\nMr Swinney assembled his cabinet hours after being officially sworn into the post at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and after he spoke to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nShona Robison, the previous Deputy First Minister and economy chief, saw her role reduced to Finance and Local Government Secretary. Otherwise, the cabinet remains unchanged.\n\nScottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said mini-reshuffle was \"uninspiring\" and again called for a fresh Holyrood election. \"This is a continuity cabinet that cannot be trusted to fix the chaos and instability they have created.\"\n\nMr Harvie warned Mr Swinney and Ms Forbes against watering down the left-wing policies pursued by the Scottish Greens when his party was in coalition government.\n\n\"When it comes to delivering fairer and more progressive taxation, a just transition from oil and gas and a watertight ban on so-called conversion therapy, it is vital that this government does not dilute the longstanding commitments that it has made.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"},

Mr Swinney's cabinet is identical to that appointed by Humza Yousaf, except for the addition of Kate Forbes as his deputy first minister.\n\nMr Swinney was finance secretary in Alex Salmond's government from 2007, before becoming Nicola Sturgeon's deputy first minister in 2014, holding a series of senior positions in her administration.\n\nHe stood down from the Scottish cabinet in tandem with her in March last year and it was assumed his career in frontline politics was over.\n\nIgnominious fall from power\n\nBut Mr Yousaf's ignominious fall from power, after he botched his decision to end his power-sharing deal with the Greens, prompted him to make a surprise comeback as First Minister.\n\nMr Swinney previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, when the party was in opposition, but was forced to step down following poor election results.\n\nSpeaking after their exchanges, Mr Ross said Mr Swinney's failure to stand by his teacher number pledge would be \"heard loud and clear across Scotland\".\n\nThe Scottish Tory leader said: \"For 16 years, John Swinney has been at the heart of an SNP government that has let down pupils, parents and teachers. Now he's the head of the government, what's going to change?\"\n\nMr Sarwar said: \"As education secretary he abandoned teachers, standards declined, the attainment gap widened, Scotland fell in the international league tables and shamefully he downgraded the results of working-class children.\n\n\"Now, as First Minister, he is trapped by the past, defending his own record while Scotland's children pay the price.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Ross's challenge on teacher numbers, Mr Swinney said: \"I have to live in the real world of the public finances available to me.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am going to be straight with the public of Scotland, I am going to tell them the way it is.\n\n\"I am going to be clear, we are under enormous financial pressure and my government is going to have to come to parliament with information about the challenges we face in the public finances, and we will be doing that in due course.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

We didn't think this would happen about 10 days ago.\"\n\nHe said they are making plans to adapt and it had been \"very precious\" to have his family at his side at the swearing in.\n\nAsked about former finance secretary Ms Forbes and whether she will have a role in his Cabinet, Mr Swinney referred to his speech last week where he said he wanted her to have a \"significant role\" to play in his team.\n\nHe added: \"I'm a man of my word.\"\n\nMr Swinney said: \"It's important that I have a Cabinet that brings together the strengths and talents of the Scottish National Party, a Cabinet that can work constructively and collaboratively with Parliament and with other parties to ensure our agenda can be taken forward.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Swinney, 60, told of his \"surprise\" at becoming First Minister, He was persuaded to stand by party colleagues after Humza Yousaf's leadership crumbled following his decision to unceremoniously sack the SNP's Green power-sharing partners.\n\nMr Swinney - who quit government in 2023 after a 16-year stint in power - said: \"To find myself accepting office as First Minister of Scotland today is therefore, to utter a classic understatement, something of a surprise.\"\n\nMs Forbes, 34, was Finance Secretary from 2020 to 2023 but left the cabinet for the backbenches when Mr Yousaf took over.\n\nShe is a controversial figure in the SNP and was attacked by a string of party colleagues last year for her faith-based views on gay marriage and other issues.\n\nAsked last year about same-sex marriage law - passed in 2014, before she became an MSP in 2016 - she said she would have opposed it, but stressed she would \"defend\" the position now as a democrat.\n\nShe also signalled she would have resigned over gender self-ID laws in 2022, had she not been on maternity leave, which meant she did not vote.\n\nDespite saying she would not allow her faith to dictate policy, party colleagues have continued to criticise her. Ms Forbes has previously said the attacks over religious views were \"showing Scotland up in a very illiberal light\".\n\nMs Forbes is also seen as being on the centre right of the SNP, and is known to be strongly disliked by several SNP ministers on the left of the party.\n\nHowever, polling last year and this year suggested she would have been the more popular choice for First Minister among the general public than either Mr Yousaf or Mr Swinney.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_musson@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Chris Musson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord President of the Court of Session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Sutherland,_Lord_Carloway", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Sutherland, Lord Carloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illiberal democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consociationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/seen-talking-colin-mackay-garden-899834096.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He won the backing of 64 MSPs, while seven Scottish Green MSPs abstained.\n\nAs Mr Swinney will lead a minority Government following the end of the power-sharing agreement with the Greens, Mr Swinney will need to work with rival parties to pass legislation and the Scottish Budget.\n\nHe shook hands with opposition leaders in Parliament after saying he would need to \"reach out to others to make things happen, to pass legislation, to agree a budget\".\n\nREAD MORE: Catering group warns industry faces 'precarious' future and appeals to First Minister as business confidence plunges\n\nREAD MORE: UK and Scottish governments 'sleepwalking' on future of Grangemouth refinery, Scottish Labour says\n\nMr Swinney said: \"If we want to fund our schools and hospitals, if we want to give our businesses a competitive edge, if we want to take climate action, if we want to eradicate child poverty, if we want to change people's lives for the better, we have got to work together to do so.\"\n\nBut he said he would \"give all of my energy and my willingness\" to achieve this, committing to be \"the first minister for everyone in Scotland\".\n\nHe added: \"I am here to serve you. I will give everything I have to build the best future for our country.\"\n\nCatherine McWilliam, Nations Director at IoD Scotland said: \"We'd like to extend a warm welcome back to Mr. Swinney as he takes up the post of First Minister. He has a history of strong relationships with many of Scotland's cross sector, cross industry leaders, and we look forward to having productive dialogue with him and his team about how best to restore business confidence and ensure economic growth across the country.\"\n\nSara Thiam, chief executive at Prosper ( formerly the Scottish Council for Development & Industry ), said: \"We congratulate John Swinney on his election as the new First Minister of Scotland. Prosper has had a positive relationship with Mr Swinney from his time at Westminster, through the early years of the Scottish Parliament, in his Ministerial offices and as Deputy First Minister.\n\n\"Over the 25 years of the Scottish Parliament the new First Minister will have seen perhaps more closely than anyone that sustainable growth supports sound public finances, good public services and a prosperous society - and the consequences of a weak economy.\n\n\"Given the challenges that Scotland faces now, it could not be more vital that this guides his programme for all of government, relations with Holyrood parties and partnerships with business, public and third sectors.\n\n\"We look forward to working with First Minister Swinney on the priorities for a more prosperous Scotland.\"\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA), said: \"The STA has built a strong and productive relationship with Mr Swinney over the course of many years, and we are encouraged to hear Mr Swinney's early signalling of a renewed commitment to economic growth.\n\n\"Furthermore, we call on the new First Minister to support Scotland in realising the vision outlined in its national tourism strategy, that 'Scotland will be a leader in 21st century tourism'.\n\n\"Key to this will be the reinstatement of a tourism and hospitality ministerial role at Cabinet level. Given the sector's immense importance to Scotland's economy and its diverse nature, we believe it is essential for our industry to have a dedicated voice at the highest level of government.\n\n\"Our vision and mission align closely with the Scottish Government's National Strategy for Economic Transformation, it is imperative that the tourism and hospitality sector is represented at the top table of government so that barriers to the sector's growth can be overcome with supportive policy, and the many opportunities in front of us are recognised and fully understood by all in the new Cabinet.\"\n\nMr Crothall added: \"We look forward to working collaboratively with Mr Swinney and his government to ensure the continued success and growth of Scotland's tourism and hospitality industry and to ensure that progressive and supportive policy is developed together with Scotland's wider business community to maximise Scotland's economic potential.\n\n\"We eagerly anticipate early engagement in the coming weeks, where we will have the opportunity to share the Scottish Tourism Alliance's policy agenda for growth with the new government\".\n\nDon't miss the latest headlines with

Swinney won the backing of 64 MPs in the vote that was all but a foregone conclusion, with nearest rival Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross picking up 31.\n\nYousaf announced last Monday that he was resigning as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose, having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.\n\nSwinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, was elected unopposed as leader of the SNP on Monday. He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence, his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.\n\nBut he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. The SNP is expected to lose several seats in the UK parliament at Westminster to a resurgent Labour party at a general election due later this year.\n\nCritics have accused the SNP, in power in the devolved parliament in Edinburgh for 17 years, of focusing on pursuing independence at the expense of issues like the cost-of-living crisis and health. The party has struggled to rebuild momentum for another independence vote since Scotland voted against leaving the UK in a referendum in 2014. Support for independence, meanwhile, has since fallen to between 41% and 43%, according to three opinion polls taken in April.\n\nWith the SNP heading a minority government in the 129-seat Scottish parliament, Swinney will need the support of another party to form a governing coalition or to pass legislation.

But before all that, Alex Cole-Hamilton.\n\nAlphabetical order dictated that the Scottish Lib Dem leader was the first of four candidates to replace Humza Yousaf as First Minister to address a special meeting of the Scottish parliament yesterday afternoon.\n\nMr Cole-Hamilton, a man who carries an entirely unjustified air of self-satisfaction, didn't expect to win the contest but, anyway, hadn't everyone noticed how well the Lib Dems were doing in England and weren't their Scottish poll ratings just splendid?\n\nDemocracy meant Mr Cole-Hamilton was given a full five minutes to indulge his fantasy of a Scottish Liberal Democrat rebirth before Tory leader Douglas Ross was invited to make his pitch.\n\nNew start: John Swinney with his wife Elizabeth Quigley at Bute House\n\nMr Ross - whose motion of no confidence pushed Mr Yousaf to resign - began by pointing out that it appeared the leader of the largest minority party at Holyrood was about to be made First Minister by the smallest party.\n\nJohn Swinney began to laugh. These were the words he'd spoken in 2003 when, as leader of the SNP opposition, he made his first pitch to become First Minister.\n\nFormer First Minister Nicola Sturgeon seemed generally unamused, frequently looking at the ceiling as Mr Ross tore into the SNP's record under her leadership.\n\nReally. The audacity of people who refuse to bow before the Nicola.\n\nScottish Labour's Anas Sarwar connected hammer with nail head.\n\nThe selection of Mr Swinney as the next leader of his party was nothing to do with what was best for Scotland and everything to do with managing a chaotic SNP.\n\nThe people of Scotland didn't want platitudes from Mr Swinney, they wanted action on issues that mattered to them.\n\nRising to his feet, Mr Swinney said he was greatly honoured to be his party's candidate.\n\nThis was, he said, a time of anniversaries - 25 years since the establishment of the Scottish parliament, a decade since the independence referendum - but now it was time to look to the future.\n\nBefore looking to the future, Mr Swinney had another look at the past. He could not resist crowing over the SNP's accomplishments.\n\nAnd what were they? How about free tuition fees and free prescriptions? How do you like them onions?\n\nThem onions are well past their sell-by date. The prescriptions and tuition fees policies are now almost 20 years old.\n\nThe SNP campaigned on them in its successful 2007 run at Holyrood and promptly set about implementing both.\n\nThere are arguments to be made over the value of these policies but one thing is for certain, neither is evidence of a Scottish government overloaded with ideas and driven to bring about change.\n\nThat change would see his government reach out across party lines.\n\nMr Swinney also paid tribute to his predecessor, Mr Yousaf, who had served with distinction.\n\nInsofar as Mr Yousaf was distinctly unsuited to the position of First Minister, this was an accurate analysis.\n\nAfter the entirely unsurprising result of the vote was announced and Mr Swinney was confirmed as the nominee to be the seventh First Minister of Scotland, there were congratulations from opposition leaders, who paid sincere tribute to Mr Swinney's family for making the sacrifices necessary to support him in his role.\n\nMr Swinney's wife, the journalist Elizabeth Quigley, who was in the public gallery, lives with multiple sclerosis and he thanked her for making it possible for him to take on this new task.\n\nAt the close, Mr Swinney strode around the parliament chamber, warmly shaking the hands of all the opposition leaders. Perhaps he really has changed. Perhaps the days of division are over.\n\nI'm not so sure. Without turning its opponents into bogeymen, how can Scottish nationalism prevail?", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Liberal_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Liberal Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cole-Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cole-Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition_fees_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuition fees in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/07/22/84580579-0-image-m-18_1715119097120.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

McAllan, another younger woman who is considered a potential future SNP leader, remains in cabinet with responsibility for net zero and energy.\n\nForbes, who served in Sturgeon's government before returning to the backbenches after Yousaf offered her what she considered a demotion, said it was \"a moment of extraordinary privilege\" to rejoin the cabinet.\n\nSwinney described her as \"an immensely talented politician\", saying her new role would be critical \"as we focus on our key commitments of eradicating child poverty, investing in public services and supporting economic growth\".\n\nHer appointment to such a senior position is a clear signal to those within the SNP who had expressed reservations about the party's governing partnership with the Scottish Greens and its influence on policy areas including rural affairs, just transition, economic growth and LGBTQ+ reforms.\n\nSince her narrow defeat by Yousaf, Forbes has become a focus for those worried that divisive and distracting rows, such as those about gender recognition reform and the implementation of the hate crime act, were giving the impression to voters that the party did not prioritise their cost of living concerns.\n\nYousaf abruptly ended the partnership two weeks ago, but was forced to step down when the Greens backed a vote of no confidence against him, leaving him unable to marshal sufficient cross-party support.\n\nThe Scottish Greens co-leader, Patrick Harvie, was critical of the appointment, saying Forbes had expressed \"quite startlingly social conservative views\" during the leadership campaign last March.\n\nBut Shona Robison, who stepped down as the deputy first minister immediately before being replaced by Forbes but remains responsible for finance and local government, said Forbes's appointment was the best way to unite the party and deliver a \"progressive agenda\".\n\nIn a letter to Swinney, Robison revealed she had made the suggestion during a conversation that took place last week, for which Swinney thanked her in his letter of acknowledgment.\n\nSwinney wrote: \"I thought hard about your offer because I recognise it as an act of selfless generosity. I agree with you that it will help me create the inclusive and unified team that is needed to take Scotland forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

However, her appointment was approved by 63 votes to 57.\n\nMr Swinney attempted to reassure the Greens and said: \"I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, a place for everybody, where everybody feels at home, at peace, where they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\"\n\nBut the exchanges laid bare the bitter divisions between the SNP and its former coalition partners after Mr Yousaf ended their power-sharing agreement a fortnight ago.\n\nThe Greens retaliated by backing a Tory motion of no confidence in Mr Yousaf, forcing him to resign. Mr Swinney was crowned his successor as SNP leader and First Minister after Ms Forbes agreed not to stand against him.\n\nShe extracted a high price for her cooperation, with Mr Swinney making her Deputy First Minister and Economy Secretary in his minority government.\n\nMr Swinney has signalled he wants to drag the SNP back to the political centre ground and away from the hard-Left Greens' agenda, which has centred on environmental and gender issues.\n\nMr Harvie challenged him to come clean on \"the direction his government will take\", before attacking Ms Forbes's views on gay marriage, abortion and childbirth outside of wedlock.\n\n\"I'm not yet sure that the First Minister acknowledges or understands just how worried many LGBT people and others are in Scotland at the moment,\" he added.\n\nHe also questioned whether Ms Forbes backs imposing higher income taxes in Scotland after she warned the latest increases could backfire by reducing revenues.\n\nThe Greens made a second attack on her in a debate that preceded a vote on whether to approve Mr Swinney's choice of ministers.\n\nRoss Greer, another Green MSP, said he shared a Christian faith with Ms Forbes and Mr Swinney but added: \"The issue is that I am being asked to vote for someone who thinks there is something wrong with me, not because of any views I hold but simply because of who I am.\"\n\nDescribing his \"very deep Christian faith\", Mr Swinney attempted to reassure Mr Greer by saying: \"I believe that nothing can separate us from the love of God\n\n\"That is the foundation of who I am... we are equal in the eyes of God, every one of us.\"\n\nPressed by reporters if Ms Forbes shared his progressive values, Mr Swinney said: \"Yes, she does actually.\"\n\nMs Forbes said: \"I am here to support the First Minister and together we serve all communities in Scotland as we further and progress the rights of every community in Scotland, and I look forward to doing my part in achieving the Government's aims in that regard.\n\n\"Not just that, but when I joined Government yesterday in a clear role to support the First Minister, I signed up to collective responsibility, so I stand by the Government's decisions and agenda to improve and progress the rights of all of Scotland's communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Mr Swinney's cabinet is identical to that appointed by Humza Yousaf, except for the addition of Kate Forbes as his deputy first minister.\n\nMr Swinney was finance secretary in Alex Salmond's government from 2007, before becoming Nicola Sturgeon's deputy first minister in 2014, holding a series of senior positions in her administration.\n\nHe stood down from the Scottish cabinet in tandem with her last year, and it was assumed his career in frontline politics was over.\n\nBut Mr Yousaf's ignominious fall from power, after he botched his decision to end his power-sharing deal with the Greens, prompted him to make a surprise comeback as First Minister.\n\nMr Swinney previously led the SNP between 2000 and 2004, when the party was in opposition, but stepped down following poor election results.\n\nSpeaking after their exchanges, Mr Ross said Mr Swinney's failure to stand by his teacher numbers pledge would be \"heard loud and clear across Scotland\".\n\n\"For 16 years, John Swinney has been at the heart of an SNP government that has let down pupils, parents and teachers,\" he said. \"Now he's the head of the Government, what's going to change?\"\n\nMr Sarwar said: \"As education secretary he abandoned teachers, standards declined, the attainment gap widened, Scotland fell in the international league tables and shamefully he downgraded the results of working-class children. Now, as First Minister, he is trapped by the past, defending his own record while Scotland's children pay the price.\"\n\nResponding to Mr Ross's challenge on teacher numbers, Mr Swinney said: \"I have to live in the real world of the public finances available to me.\n\n\"I am going to be straight with the public of Scotland - I am going to tell them the way it is. I am going to be clear - we are under enormous financial pressure, and my Government is going to have to come to Parliament with information about the challenges we face in the public finances. We will be doing that in due course.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_johnson@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Simon Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister's_Questions_(Scottish_Parliament)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Salmond_government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Salmond government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary for Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_City_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow City Council"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2024/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000376937609_17152738363300_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3Z7i_2nUjuO-XXgVmfiyhMbHf4DfgeegiUIPq8ZyLgk.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Rather, the tone of some of the comments about Mr Swinney came as a surprise because there was little doubt that, whether justified or not, the overall attitude of the business community to the SNP seemed to have soured as predecessor Humza Yousaf's period in office went on. And the previous situation was certainly not one of harmony.\n\nThe souring of the attitude over recent months was itself perhaps somewhat puzzling, given Mr Yousaf adopted a positive attitude to the business community, even if he did not grant all its wishes. He also delivered some thoughtful speeches on the economy, which were in stark contrast to the bilge we have tended to be served up by Conservative Cabinet ministers at Westminster in recent years.\n\nREAD MORE: Ian McConnell: The sad, sad tale of a Scottish bank\n\nNotably, Mr Yousaf highlighted the enormous hit to public spending in Scotland arising from the damage that Brexit has done to the economy. He also hammered home the importance of free university tuition in Scotland, something which is surely very much to the long-term benefit of the economy in terms of the skills base.\n\nAnd Mr Yousaf certainly endeavoured to open a greater dialogue with business. He also postponed the introduction of the deposit return scheme, and sent proposals to restrict alcohol advertising and promotion back to the drawing board.\n\nMr Swinney is now taking up the post of First Minister without having the Scottish Greens as the SNP's junior partner in government, given the ending of the Bute House Agreement by Mr Yousaf. This termination was, of course, followed swiftly by Mr Yousaf's resignation as first minister.\n\nThe Scottish Greens were not, for understandable reasons, viewed by the business community as champions of the economy.\n\nLorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, said in an interview with The Herald on Sunday in 2022 that economic growth was an area where her party had \"a fundamentally different position to the Scottish Government\".\n\nFor anyone interested in the uplift to living standards that should be delivered by boosting economic growth and wealth creation, that was surely a worrying comment.\n\nIt is obviously absolutely valid to debate how the rewards of economic growth are distributed and of course there are wildly divergent opinions on this - with the ruling Conservatives at Westminster showing exactly how it should not be done. However, that is a different matter altogether to that raised by Ms Slater.\n\nBefore Mr Yousaf became first minister last spring, it did seem that the business community as a whole would have preferred to see leadership race rival Kate Forbes win the contest.\n\nOf course, Mr Swinney has now promised Ms Forbes a senior role in his administration.\n\nAnd even the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland, which has certainly not been known for heaping praise on SNP politicians' policymaking, was somewhat complimentary about Mr Swinney on Monday.\n\nIts compliments were not exactly lavish, but seemed highly notable nonetheless. The CBI's comments seemed to go a fair way beyond the usual platitudes of an organisation congratulating a politician on their elevation and saying it looked forward to working with them etcetera.\n\nOf course, compliments might disappear swiftly if the CBI does not like what it sees in the policymaking of Mr Swinney's administration.\n\nTracy Black, CBI devolved nations ambassador, said on Monday:\u202f\"We congratulate John Swinney on becoming the SNP's new leader. Mr Swinney collaborated positively with business in his previous roles as deputy first minister and interim finance secretary and we look forward to working with him as First Minister.\"\n\nIt was interesting to hear the CBI make plain its view that Mr Swinney had \"collaborated positively with business\".\n\nSo far, so good then for Mr Swinney, it seems.\n\nLast week, when having a conversation with a senior executive of a major Scottish company about political developments, he talked about how Mr Swinney had always been happy to engage with business, listen to its problems, and ask what could be done to fix these.\n\nWhile we should not underestimate the scale of the task for Mr Swinney to win over a business community that has on the whole been somewhat displeased about the SNP in recent times, to say the least, these positive views of business leaders about his approach are surely a good starting point for him.\n\nREAD MORE: Ian McConnell: What on earth is the SNP's big problem with business?\n\nMs Black went on quickly to spell out what she would like to see from Mr Swinney and his administration.\n\nShe said: \"With the Scottish economy continuing to tread water, the new First Minister has no time to waste. We need to create a competitive and resilient economy that champions business and delivers opportunity for communities across Scotland.\u202f \"We look forward to re-engaging with Mr Swinney on measures to support improved productivity through innovation and technology, ensure our highly educated workforce contributes to sustainable economic growth and to encourage global investment and skilled employees into Scotland.\"\n\nThese do sound in the main like the kind of things in which Mr Swinney will be interested.\n\nIndeed, he highlighted in his speech on Monday that the economy would be a focus for him.\n\nIt is probably worth noting, in the context of Ms Black's comment about the \"Scottish economy continuing to tread water\", that the broader UK economy fell into technical recession last year. Scotland actually avoided this fate, although these things are a matter of fine margins.\n\nREAD MORE: Ian McConnell: CalMac storm rages on but ownership question has clear answer\n\nAnd it is worth observing that Mr Yousaf seemed interested in pursuing much of what is on Ms Black's wish-list, yet ultimately failed to make significant progress in winning over the business community, with a further increase in the extra income tax burden for higher earners in Scotland among apparently unpopular measures.\n\nThe Scottish Tourism Alliance also had some positive things to say about Mr Swinney's appointment on Monday.\n\nThe tourism industry body was pleased about the return to a senior role of Ms Forbes, who came across as a safe pair of hands in her former cabinet secretary for finance and the economy role.\n\nThe STA said it welcomed the election of Mr Swinney and his \"renewed commitment to economic growth\".\n\nIts chief executive, Marc Crothall, declared: \"We also very much welcome Mr Swinney's commitment to offer Kate Forbes a senior role in his Cabinet...Both have recognised the significant importance of a healthy, prosperous tourism and hospitality sector in Scotland and have consistently engaged openly and constructively with the STA to discuss the many challenges faced by our sector.\"\n\nThere do, then, certainly look to be plenty of positives on which Mr Swinney can build.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type":

On Wednesday, it turned, and it was the SNP who turned it. The new First Minister John Swinney's Cabinet reshuffle was the SNP's acknowledgement that it's no longer the constitution, stupid, it's the economy that matters most now.\n\nMr Swinney's reshuffle was a largely understated affair. The only changes at Cabinet level were the reintroduction of Kate Forbes, as deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for the Economy and Gaelic, and the stripping of the deputy First Minister role from Shona Robison (still Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Local Government) and the economy brief from M\u00e0iri McAllan (still Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy).\n\nBut it sent all the signals Mr Swinney wanted it to. Ms Forbes' elevation brought her back into the fold and will have reassured her backers that Mr Swinney is intent on being the unifying figure that he promised to be when he launched his leadership campaign last week. And by giving her the economy brief, separating it from net zero and removing the 'wellbeing' prefix, he signalled to the business community that economic growth will be a major focus of his government.\n\nIndependence is off the table - for now (Image: free)\n\nOtherwise, Mr Swinney went out of his way to avoid putting his parliamentarians' noses out of joint. Again, the theme here is party unity - he will need all of his MSPs onside if he is to govern as a minority, and he understands the importance of satisfying the demands of competing factions within his party.\n\nThe opposition parties' cries of 'continuity' might be largely accurate - though Ms Forbes' return to Cabinet and the slimming down of the ministerial ranks caveat that - but are also relatively weak as a response to Mr Swinney's reshuffle. Yes, the SNP remain in power and will likely do so until at least 2026, that isn't a critique.\n\nIf anything, their response betrayed an uncertainty about how to attack Mr Swinney - of course, they will run against the SNP's record in 2026, but the Swinney government aims to change public perceptions of the party and its record. The opposition parties need to find ways to undermine that project, beginning with its leader and public face.\n\nAn Ipsos poll conducted immediately after Humza Yousaf announced his resignation as First Minister and leader of the SNP found that Mr Swinney was the politician Scots were most likely to say would make a good First Minister. His net score on the measure was +14, and the only other politician to come close, on +13, is now his deputy First Minister and Economy Secretary. Anas Sarwar scored +4, and Douglas Ross -36. Among those who voted SNP in 2021, the voters Mr Swinney needs to win back if the SNP are to recover, he scored +48.\n\nA more recent poll conducted by Norstat found that 30% of 2021 SNP voters said they were more likely to vote SNP in the upcoming elections if Mr Swinney was leader, and just 12% said they would be less likely to do so with him as leader. In comparison, Ms Forbes broke even on the same measure (24% either way).\n\nREAD MORE\n\nJohn Swinney must hold his nerve and keep tax high for the wealthy\n\nWhy are today's young people so reluctant to form relationships?\n\nSwinney must spring Humza Yousaf's indy trap\n\nSo, Mr Swinney begins his tenure as First Minister as a relatively popular politician, particularly among his party's voters, and as a net asset for a party looking to win back those voters now considering voting Labour. His Cabinet reshuffle signals a renewed focus by his government on the top priority of the public, and it seeks to address his party's internal divisions. Characterisations of Mr Swinney as a continuity leader will simply not cut the mustard, particularly when he is sending signals to the contrary.\n\nAll of this does, of course, come at a cost. As James Carville, the legendary US Democratic Party strategist whose organising principles for the 1992 Clinton campaign coined the phrase \"the economy, stupid\", would put it: to choose to talk about one thing is to choose not to talk about other things.\n\nI, and many other commentators, academics, and politicians have argued over the past year that the SNP need to move away from a campaign focus on independence to get across a message relevant to voters' priorities. Mr Swinney's ministerial reshuffle came the closest the SNP have done to accepting that necessity.\n\nGone is the role of Minister for Independence, and work on the series of pro-independence policy papers started by Nicola Sturgeon and continued by Humza Yousaf has been 'paused' for an indefinite period. While Mr Swinney will not seek to change his party's independence policy and will go ahead with formulation claiming that a majority of seats at the next general election is a mandate to make some kind of progress towards secession, neither will independence be a focus of his government nor, presumably, his general election campaign.\n\nOur cartoonist Steven Camley's take on Swinney's Cabinet (Image: free)\n\nAnd so lastly, as well as re-orienting his government and messaging towards the economy, and seeking to unite and temper his party, Mr Swinney's reshuffle also reflects an acknowledgement that independence - far from being \"frustratingly close\", as Humza Yousaf put it - is not a remotely realistic prospect in the near term.\n\nThis also means accepting that the constitution cannot continue to form the basis of the SNP's election campaigning and that the binding collective purpose of the independence movement is no longer sufficient to retain power.\n\nIn exchange for accepting the fractionalisation of the independence movement and the need to work with unionist MSPs, Mr Swinney will hope to gain party unity and an electoral platform that can keep his party in the majority of Scots at Westminster and in power at Holyrood.\n\nLike all political strategies, there is risk involved here. To govern is to choose, and Mr Swinney will have to choose carefully to maintain party unity long enough for his strategy to pay off. But unlike his predecessor, Mr Swinney at least has a strategy, and his Cabinet reshuffle was the first big indicator of what that strategy is.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType":

Almost everything that John Swinney has said and done since replacing Humza Yousaf this week shows he grasps the palpable wish - south of the border as well as north - for more effective government that is led by more sensible politicians who do not spend their time playing to the gallery. The question, after 17 years governing Scotland, is whether any SNP leader can now deliver this.\n\nMr Swinney's election speech on Tuesday and his debut at first minister's questions at Holyrood on Thursday were each designed to show that he gets it. On Tuesday, after accepting that cross-party parliamentary cooperation would be necessary under the minority government he now leads, he perambulated through the chamber to shake hands with other party leaders. It was a small gesture, of a kind that newly elected leaders sometimes make before things get more serious, but it was a good start nonetheless.\n\nAt first minister's questions, Mr Swinney had a much harder task. He had promised to be straight with the public about Scotland's difficulties and he said that he was offering fresh leadership. But Scotland's current problems come on the SNP's watch and Mr Swinney is the embodiment of SNP continuity. He has sat in Holyrood ever since it resumed in 1999. He held senior ministerial jobs under both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. He offers not freshness but familiarity.\n\nMr Swinney therefore owns Scotland's current problems. The proof lay in the eagerness with which both the Conservatives and Labour attacked him on Thursday - Mr Swinney is both a former education and a former finance secretary - over Scotland's educational decline and its acute teacher shortages this year. It also lay in the difficulty Mr Swinney had in answering their charges. He took refuge in blaming inflation and UK austerity, as the SNP routinely does, but refused to admit that the SNP was re-elected in 2021 pledging to recruit 3,500 new teachers and has failed to do so. There was nothing fresh about that approach.\n\nMr Swinney's new cabinet is familiar too. Most of its members are doing the same jobs as under Mr Yousaf. But there are two resonant differences. The first is the return of Kate Forbes, the socially conservative Highlander who is popular with voters. The Greens, who were effectively in coalition with the SNP until last month, launched a strong personal attack on her on Thursday. Mr Swinney's claim to be a unifying leader who governs \"for everyone\" is likely to face many more such attacks in future.\n\nThe other striking change is Mr Swinney's decision to scrap the minister of independence post created by his predecessor. If nothing else, this signals the end of the Building a New Scotland discussion papers - 13 of them at the last count - produced under Mr Yousaf. It may also imply a new approach to the government's controversial spending and civil service work on separating from the UK.\n\nThe big question is whether there will be any tacit downplaying of independence itself. Mr Swinney knows Scottish voters are focused on the cost of living and public services. He needs to focus there too, and seek cross-party cooperation for what he calls his centre-left agenda. But independence is always the SNP's overriding raison d'etre. Mr Swinney is steeped in it. He will struggle to find much willingness to cooperate, especially as the UK general election draws closer.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_a_New_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Building a New Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2015 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austerity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c208696448c3d7ad4ee02948ff033436e1a2cd/0_270_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=6c4c125a44ed52f5bee33e6bac11261e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

This newsletter keeps its readers updated with the essential Scottish perspective on the ballot set to be held this year.\n\nWe hope you enjoy it - and you can get the newsletter direct into your inbox for free every week by clicking HERE.\n\nRECENT polls have made for pretty grim reading for the SNP.\n\nA new one by the Sunday Times last week indicated that the party would retain just 15 of its current 43 seats at the forthcoming General Election - the forecast coming after a turbulent week which saw Humza Yousaf announce his resignation as first minister.\n\nScottish Tory and Labour leaders Douglas Ross and Anas Sarwar have repeatedly been seen grinning ear to ear the past few weeks.\n\nBut in bringing down Yousaf and bringing in Swinney, the opposition parties may have given the SNP an opportunity to push back and repair some of the damage of the last year.\n\nAt least, that is elections expert John Curtice's view.\n\nIn his BBC column yesterday, he noted that Swinney starts his job with better polling numbers than his predecessor.\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Kate Forbes? Scotland's new Deputy First Minister\n\nAccording to Ipsos, 37% feel Swinney will do a good job as First Minister, while only 23% a bad one.\n\nPanelbase, meanwhile, says that among those who voted SNP in 2019, 28% reckon they are more likely to vote SNP with Swinney in the top job.\n\nOf course, there is still a lot of work to be done and time may be the former deputy first minister's worst enemy.\n\nNothing can be built on shaky foundations and Swinney will first have to unite his party. And, in fairness, running unopposed for the leadership will have helped.\n\nAlready, his move to make Kate Forbes his Deputy First Minister (above) should go some way in bringing together the left and right of the party.\n\nWith the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens no longer in place, Swinney will also need all his experience as he is forced to lead a minority government at Holyrood.\n\nBut his life will be made easier by the fact that much of the incoming legislation was already spearheaded by the Greens in the first place - from the Fair Rents (Scotland) Bill to bans on conversion therapy - meaning he should be able to count on their backing in most instances.\n\nBut perhaps Swinney's biggest challenge will be in uniting the pro-independence vote.\n\nPanelbase has reported that only 56% of those who would vote Yes in an independence referendum would currently vote SNP in a General Election. Around a fifth (21%) said they would vote Labour - a staggering amount if true.\n\nThe SNP can't forget what brought them such electoral success - the indy movement, firmly behind them. And Swinney will have to rush to repair that relationship as soon as possible.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_walker@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "James Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Curtice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party\u2013Scottish_Greens_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party\u2013Scottish Greens agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conversion therapy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_181/33f8a458d445cadcbb9a2f76e35c69a9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

deputy", "body": "Kate Forbes has become Scotland's youngest ever Deputy First Minister as John Swinney announced a largely unchanged Cabinet team.\n\nMs Forbes, 34, a former Holyrood finance secretary, had been tipped to run for the SNP leadership again after Humza Yousaf stood down just over a week ago, but she instead opted to back Mr Swinney and he went on to claim the position of party leader unopposed.\n\nHe has now rewarded her by making her his deputy, and also giving her responsibility for the economy and Gaelic.\n\nBy giving such a key role to Ms Forbes, a critic of some Scottish Government policies who had been on the backbenches during Mr Yousaf's time in charge, Mr Swinney will hope to ease internal tensions within the SNP.\n\nThe new First Minister assembled his Cabinet hours after being officially sworn into the post at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and after he spoke to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nSpeaking after his top team was announced, Mr Swinney said he is \"committed to working collaboratively across the Parliament to address the pressing issues facing the people of Scotland\".\n\nThat will be required as the SNP is now a minority administration at Holyrood after Mr Yousaf tore up the powersharing deal the party had with the Scottish Greens - a move which ultimately led to his resignation as first minister.\n\nMr Swinney's Cabinet includes eight women - thought to be the most ever - and two other men.\n\nNeil Gray, who was appointed Health Secretary earlier this year, stays in the post, while Angus Robertson remains Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Secretary.\n\nShona Robison, who had been deputy first minister under Mr Yousaf, loses that position but remains in the Cabinet - keeping her finance brief and also taking on responsibility for local government.\n\nFormer teacher Jenny Gilruth remains Education Secretary, Angela Constance retains her position as Justice Secretary, and Fiona Hyslop continues as Transport Secretary.\n\nMairi McAllan remains in the Cabinet but with a slightly slimmed down brief - she had been the net zero, wellbeing economy and energy secretary, but now has responsibility for net zero and energy.\n\nShirley-Anne Sommerville and Mairi Gougeon also continue in their previous roles - as Social Justice Secretary, and Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands Secretary respectively.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"I have selected a Cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my Government will pursue - eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services.\n\n\"My overriding priority will be to work to eradicate child poverty in Scotland, an issue on which real progress has been made through measures such as the Scottish child payment.\n\n\"The Government I lead will maximise every lever at our disposal to tackle the scourge of poverty in our country.\"\n\nMs Forbes said she was \"deeply honoured\" to be appointed as his deputy, describing it as an \"extraordinary privilege\".\n\nShe added: \"I look forward to working with John and Cabinet colleagues, delivering for the people of Scotland and building a better country.\"\n\nSpeaking earlier on Wednesday after he was sworn into office at the Court of Session, Mr Swinney had said: \"It's a really overwhelming moment to take the oath of office in front of the Lord President of the Court of Session and formally assume the role of First Minister.\n\n\"I look forward to dedicating my future to serving the people of Scotland.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary opportunity to change lives for the better and I'll continue to use every moment that's available to me to do so.\"", "source":

Almost as many said the party was not united (43%) as said that it was (47%). Less than half (45%) reckon the SNP government is competent.\n\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the departure of the Greens has done nothing to improve the party's standing.\n\nTwo polls conducted since then, but before it became clear Mr Swinney would become leader without a contest, put the SNP behind Labour.\n\nEqually, YouGov were now reporting that 67% believed that Mr Yousaf was doing badly as first minister, up from 45% last September. As many as 60% now regarded him unfavourably.\n\nBut in bringing down Mr Yousaf the opposition parties have potentially given the SNP an opportunity to repair some of the damage of the last 12 months.\n\nCertainly, Mr Swinney starts his job with rather better polling numbers than his predecessor.\n\nOnly 40% feel unfavourably about him, 20 points lower than the equivalent figure for Mr Yousaf.\n\nAccording to Ipsos 37% feel Mr Swinney will do a good job as first minister, only 23% a bad one.\n\nAnd Panelbase say that among those who voted SNP in 2019, 28% reckon they are more likely to vote SNP with Mr Swinney at the helm - over twice the proportion (13%) who take the opposite view.\n\nHowever, whether Mr Swinney can seize the opportunity he seems to have remains to be seen.\n\nHe would appear to have a good chance of being able to make his party seem less divided. The lack of a contest for the leadership will help for a start. And Mr Swinney is widely respected within his party.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the open criticism of Mr Yousaf's regime came from those associated with Kate Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in last year's ballot.\n\nShe is now expected to be part of Mr Swinney's new government. So perhaps the noises off will die down.\n\nAnd there is also an easily identifiable body of voters for Mr Swinney to target - those who have become disenchanted with the SNP but who still believe in independence.\n\nPanelbase have reported that only just over half (56%) of those who would vote Yes in an independence referendum are currently minded to vote SNP for Westminster. As many as 21% say they would vote Labour.\n\nBut the key question is whether Mr Swinney can find the persuasive arguments and engaging style needed to bring these voters back into the SNP fold.\n\nThis was the aspect of the job of party leader that Mr Swinney found more difficult when he was previously leader 20 years ago.\n\nMr Swinney says he is a changed man. The SNP have to hope this means he can now change their fortunes.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Salmond_government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Salmond government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Scottish_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Scottish independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yTmxq6yI1ayV9JoM2SIBeA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/316ef757d549c3e2c58a0d0b57232e73", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

With no referendum imminent, opposition parties criticised the publications as a waste of taxpayers' money. The thirteenth in the series, on justice in an independent Scotland, was published last month.\n\nAlyn Smith MP, the SNP's Europe spokesperson at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that \"all of our government ministers are focused on independence in Europe\".\n\nSwinney said on Monday as he was elected SNP leader that he wanted to persuade people of the case for independence by creating a \"vibrant economy\" and tackling challenges across public services.\n\nThe announcement came as part of a minor ministerial shake-up following Swinney's limited cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday. After being sworn in as first minister at the court of session, he appointed Kate Forbes, the former finance secretary who stepped aside to allow him to stand unopposed for SNP leader, as his deputy first minister.\n\nForbes, who narrowly lost to Yousaf in last year's leadership election to replace Nicola Sturgeon, is a social conservative who split the party when she disclosed she would not have voted for equal marriage. She has also been critical of the stalled gender recognition reform bill, which was passed with cross-party support at Holyrood, then blocked by Westminster.\n\nAsked on Wednesday if she had a message for LGBTQ+ people after her return to cabinet, Forbes said she would support Swinney in \"finding places of consensus\".\n\nSmith said that there were \"huge areas of consensus ... we also need to get back to the SNP being a big tent where there's room for everybody as there is in the whole of Scotland. Scotland's a big tent but we're too small a community to exclude people, and people of faith should have a role in politics\".\n\nHe said Forbes's position on equalities issues was \"a matter for her to work through her conscience\".\n\nThe Scottish Greens on Wednesday expressed concerns about Forbes' \"quite startlingly social conservative views\". Her elevation is considered an olive branch from Swinney to those in the SNP who had expressed reservations about the party's governing partnership with the Scottish Greens - ditched by Yousaf two weeks ago, precipitating his resignation - and its influence on policy including rural affairs, transition, economic growth and LGBTQ+ reforms.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday, Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens co-leader, said her party was experiencing a \"surge\" in membership, \"particularly people in the LGBTQ+ community are now looking at the SNP and thinking 'oh my goodness is this really the home for me?'.\"\n\nIn other ministerial announcements, Swinney brought back Ivan McKee, a key ally of Forbes and a respected business communicator, as minister for public finance. Meanwhile, Emma Roddick, the minister tasked with guiding the bill to ban conversion practices through Holyrood, returns to the backbenches.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

It is a measure of the times Mr Swinney finds himself in that his first task, before even becoming leader, was to enter into negotiations with a potential rival. As the leader of a minority government he will be doing a lot of that.\n\nHiccup solved, Mr Swinney was declared SNP leader on Monday in a ceremony in Glasgow that had as much fizz as a two-day-old glass of Irn-Bru. Much thought had obviously gone into making the event as low-key as possible. This was the new, slightly more humble SNP showing its face, a party getting back to normal after the upheaval of the past fortnight.\n\nEvery new beginning needs a repenting sinner, so step forward Mr Swinney with a plea to make politics nice again. There would be no more \"shouting at people\" said the man who has functioned as the Scottish Parliament's BOGOF Statler and Waldorf. From here on it was all about reaching out and joining forces, behaving respectfully towards each other.\n\nThere were more warm words when the action moved to Holyrood for the selection of the First Minister. Earlier, outgoing First Minister Humza Yousaf had to tender his resignation to the King (Charles, not John). In his speech to parliament, Mr Yousaf spoke of what an honour it had been to serve. At 39 he is still young enough for one of those comebacks that are now in vogue.\n\nREAD MORE Meet Scotland's seventh First Minister\n\nREAD MORE Doomed refinery set for stay of execution\n\nSubscribe here for more Scottish news and views\n\nHe has bounced back well from his self-inflicted humiliation. A ministerial exit payment, final amount yet to be disclosed, and a hefty pension no doubt helped. He looked rejuvenated, all worries lifted from his shoulders and transferred to John Swinney's.\n\nIt has taken quite some doing, but Mr Yousaf has managed to leave frontline politics in a worse state than he found it.\n\nFor a while there he had given Scots that most precious of commodities, hope. Not intentionally, but some good might have come out of the chaos he caused. The best way forward would have been to call an early election. That was never going to happen: Christmas, vote, turkeys, etc.\n\nFailing that, some change was in order, as allowed for in the parliamentary rules. Not a new start, only an election would do that, but a refresh. And the best way to ensure that was to have a contest of ideas and personalities. Yet it was not to be.\n\nInstead, it is out with the old First Minister, and in with an even older one. An older one, moreover, who has led his party before with little if any distinction. One who just over a year ago left government after a long stint as deputy First Minister. A backer of Mr Yousaf for the leadership no less. It would be hard to imagine anyone, save Nicola Sturgeon, who has been as in with the bricks in recent years as Mr Swinney.\n\nI will admit to groaning inwardly on seeing that he was going for the leadership and would win it unopposed. Like Sir John Curtice, I too remember when Mr Swinney was SNP leader first time, and he wasn't really that good at it.\n\nAs Kate Forbes might have put it given half a chance, when he was party leader before he lost elections, when he was education secretary he sent standards into a nose-dive, and when he was deputy First Minister he went along with every failed initiative presented to him. What makes him think he could do a better job this time?\n\nAh, but he is not the same John Swinney of 20 years ago, he says. He has acknowledged being physically and mentally exhausted when he left government after Ms Sturgeon quit, and that was why, along with other factors, he did not stand for the leadership then. Now, as he told The Herald's Andrew Learmonth, he is rested and \"ready for what lies ahead\".\n\nThat is a huge change in what is a relatively short time. Good on Mr Swinney if he is back to peak fitness and raring to go. But is he certain he wants to return to this particular fray at this time? We know what he offers his party, a calm head in fraught times, but what is there for the majority of Scots? Where are the new ideas, the fresh thinking, and will it be allowed to flourish? Without them Holyrood in the next two years will make the current zombie parliament at Westminster look a hive of activity.\n\nMr Swinney has spoken recently of not wanting to have regrets in life, of facing the dreaded \"if onlys\" and \"what ifs\". For many men in his age band, the response is to buy a mountain of Lycra and a bike and head for new places. Almost any activity would be less fraught than becoming First Minister of Scotland in 2024. Has he considered herding cats?\n\nIt is too late for Mr Swinney to be having a mid-life wobble and too early for him to retire. That, respectfully, as we say in the new polite politics, is his problem.\n\nWe will have a better idea where Mr Swinney is heading, and why, when he announces his full cabinet. As someone tipped to be in that cabinet once said, more of the same is not a manifesto, it is an acceptance of mediocrity. Scotland can do better. On that, at least, we can all agree.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statler_and_Waldorf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statler and Waldorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irn-Bru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irn-Bru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Curtice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Herald (Glasgow)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18053958/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The only real change is the appointment of former leadership hopeful Kate Forbes as deputy first minister. She was promised a 'significant' role and in addition to the office of DFM she will hold the economy portfolio.\n\nForbes's return will be welcome news to those keen on healing internal rifts but will displease SNP progressives, who revile Forbes for her orthodox Christian views on same-sex marriage and gender identity ideology. She has called her new appointment 'a moment of extraordinary privilege' while Swinney has described her as 'an immensely talented politician'. It doesn't make up for how shabbily she was treated, which would have been roundly condemned if she belonged to any other faith, but the new post is an acknowledgement of her abilities and contribution to the SNP.\n\nBeyond the addition of Swinney in the top job and Forbes as his number two, nothing else changes.\n\nShona Robison, deputy first minister and finance secretary under Yousaf, retains the finance brief. In a letter published today, she urged Swinney to make Forbes DFM for the sake for party unity. Yousaf ally and former MP Neil Gray remains health secretary while Jenny Gilruth, someone spoken of as a potential replacement for Yousaf, stays in post at education. M\u00e0iri McAllan, who previously served as a special adviser to Nicola Sturgeon and was fast-tracked into ministerial office, continues as cabinet secretary for wellbeing economy, net zero and energy.\n\nSNP veteran Fiona Hyslop is kept at transport and Mairi Gougeon at rural affairs. Angus Robertson, a key figure in the post-Salmond SNP hierarchy, stays on as constitution, external affairs and culture secretary. Social justice secretary and an architect of the controversial Gender Recognition Reform Bill, since blocked by Westminster, Shirley-Anne Somerville continues in her role. Nationalist mainstay Angela Constance, promoted from drugs minister to justice and home affairs secretary when Yousaf took over from Sturgeon, will also be keeping her job.\n\nWith this almost shuffle-less reshuffle, John Swinney is sending two messages. The first is that there is new leadership at the top that balances the moderate centre-left and pro-business, pro-growth strands of SNP ideology. Under Yousaf and in the final years of Sturgeon, the Scottish government drifted too far to the left and, more damagingly, away from an agenda built around economics and public service delivery to one invested in identity politics and progressive cultural reforms. The latter were divisive inside the party, disliked by the public, and alienated some of the SNP's traditional support. A Swinney-Forbes leadership is likely to return to 'bread and butter' concerns.\n\nThe second message is one of continuity. There has been altogether too much upheaval of late. Swinney is the SNP's third leader and Scotland's third first minister in a little over a year. Comparisons are beginning to be drawn between the formerly and famously ultra-disciplined SNP and the hectic reign of the Tories at Westminster. Swinney will want to defy such comparisons and keeping the government's main cast in situ sends an early signal of his intentions. This note of continuity underscores how much concern there is in the Nationalist hierarchy about internal splits ahead of a general election.\n\nPersonalities are important but we have yet to see how Swinney's ascendancy affects policy. Retaining Yousaf's cabinet will be characterised by opponents as an admission that Swinney will be more of the same, but if the SNP has a superpower it is the ability to morph ideologically if doing so is likely to serve the interests of the party and the cause. That cause - independence - has been on the back burner for some time, which is frustrating for true believers, but where much of the public wants it to remain for now. How Swinney manages the issue will be an early test of his leadership.\n\nSwinney has already been SNP leader, an unhappy stint from 2000 to 2004. It was a tenure marred by division and ill-discipline within his MSP group. He has had 20 years, 16 of them as a senior cabinet minister, to mature as a politician and a leader. We will now see how much he has learned. But bringing Kate Forbes back in from the cold is a sign that the Swinney of 2024 is a cannier operator than the Swinney of 2004. He has identified the SNP's biggest talent, a woman who can speak to voters otherwise unreachable by the party, and put her back at the top of government. There will be disquiet about that within the SNP but much more on the opposition benches.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Since midday on Monday the internet has been ablaze with comments from SNP MPs, MSPs, wannabe MPs and their army of employees who are all \"delighted\" that John Swinney is their latest leader.\n\nOnly days before, the very same folk were equally delighted with and pledging allegiance to Humza Yousaf. Photographs with John, some from 20 and even 30 years ago, have been dusted down, posted online, shared, liked and commented on.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney to be Scotland's next first minister after Holyrood vote\n\nHumza Yousaf is being airbrushed from history as if Winston Smith from Orwell's novel 1984 is hard at work erasing all traces of the inconvenient past. It seems that according to Mr Swinney, \"today is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history - a chapter that will be about uniting, coming together and dedicating ourselves the service of Scotland.\" He envisaged a country where \"people have good jobs, the climate is protected, the vulnerable are lifted up and opportunity is available for all\". He said that politics was in the \"worst state of his career\" without mentioning his party have actually been in charge of it all for the past 17 years.\n\nWith only months to go to a Westminster election, maybe it is too much to ask Mr Swinney to save the SNP seats currently exposed and about to be targeted by the Labour and Tory parties.\n\nThe road to May 2026 lies ahead, it is not as long as Mr Swinney might hope and, like many of the roads in Scotland, it is peppered with potholes.\n\nIain Wilson\n\nStirling\n\nJOHN Swinney's promised \"new chapter\" must not come at the cost of throwing out vital policies promised in the Bute House Agreement that will help people living in cold, damp homes. We need all MSPs to unite and support the Scottish Government to take the actions needed to help those in fuel poverty and to ensure all households can access affordable energy in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to parliament, the Heat in Buildings Bill needs to be ambitious in its vision for improving the energy efficiency and insulation of the nation's homes and contains a clear fuel poverty duty enshrined in the legislation.\n\nREAD MORE: Nicola Sturgeon reacts to John Swinney becoming first minister\n\nMSPs also need to unite in support of the current Housing Bill and a strengthened framework of support for the renewables and offshore wind sectors and the fastest possible \"just transition\" for the oil and gas sector, as described in the government's Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan.\n\nThese long-term solutions to the cold homes crisis need to be backed by shorter-term crisis measures such as additional government support in future budgets, reintroducing the Fuel Insecurity Fund to help those most at risk of harm and struggling in energy debt and ensuring the new Pension Age Winter Heating Payment is better targeted than the Winter Fuel Payment that it replaces.\n\nA failure to take these measures will see households condemned to spend more winters in cold, damp, mouldy homes. The impacts of this will be felt not just in the suffering of families and individuals, but also on the NHS and the collective mental health of communities.\n\nSimon Francis\n\nCoordinator, End Fuel Poverty Coalition\n\nSO, we now have a new leader. He would certainly not have been my choice if there had been a contest but like the rest of SNP members I will accept it. I suspect Kate Forbes must have thought that she could not beat the machine. She may have lost her only chance of being the leader of the SNP, but ultimately that was her decision to make.\n\nLet us take a look at what is to come for us. On the day we get a new leader, a so-called Scottish paper I like to call the Daily Baillie had several pages telling its readers how bad the SNP is and has been for all the years it has been in government. All the usual suspects were letting us have it with both barrels. They were saying that we should have had a Scottish election and bemoaning the fact that they were not going to get their wish.\n\nREAD MORE: People of Glasgow react to John Swinney becoming SNP leader\n\nThese third-raters need to be put back into their box, providing one big enough for their heads can be found. I have thought since Humza was in trouble that we should have let them have their election and made it about only independence.\n\nInstead we have, as I see it, cowered in the corner instead of taking them head-on. Maybe the strategy John has will work, but I so wish we had just done it and taken the whole indy movement with us. Time will tell.\n\nOld John\n\nAyrshire\n\nDOUBLING council tax on second homes took an age to come in. Devolution powers do allow much wider local tax development.\n\nThe open discussion Shona Craven calls for (Honesty is the best policy when debating taxation, May 7) should begin with dissecting the Scottish Government's Commission on Local Tax Reform published in December 2015.\n\nCould it be that ahead of the Scottish election in May 2016 the Scottish ministers were heavily lobbied by the private house builders - the land bank industry? I have my suspicions.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney backs Humza Yousaf's Scottish independence strategy\n\nMany in the grassroots SNP and most Greens have advocated Land Value Tax (LVT) for decades, long before Graeme McCormick's convoluted Annual Ground Floor and Roof Rent appeared.\n\nSo John Swinney can open up the fairer tax debate and take early action to widen the tax base by a pilot scheme for LVT on the largest landholdings, and then roll our LVT for all Scottish property in five years or so.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors":

praising him as a \"man of integrity and compassion\" who carried \"widespread respect\" across the party.\n\nFollowing the news of Mr Swinney's success, Ms Tweed offered her congratulations on X, writing: \"Delighted to see JohnSwinney will become our new leader of the SNP and is now set to become the next First Minister of Scotland.\n\n\"Looking forward to working with John as we move Scotland forward towards the General Election and on to independence.\"\n\nMs Tweed's SNP colleague and Stirling MP Alyn Smith has also registered his support for Mr Swinney in recent days and was also quick to offer his good wishes.\n\nIn an interview on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Smith labelled Mr Swinney \"the right person for the right role at the moment\".\n\nHe added: \"I look forward to him uniting the party.\n\n\"My happiness is tempered by the scale of the task that we've got to do.\n\n\"We've got a lot of things we need to change about how the party has been operating lately.\"\n\nMr Swinney had initially faced questions of a contest from Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes - but Ms Forbes pulled out of the running and gave her backing to Mr Swinney, with rumours of Ms Forbes being offered a senior role in a future government.\n\nMeanwhile, SNP activist Graeme McCormick was rumoured to be gathering a challenge for the role after claiming last week he had enough support from party branches to put himself forward.\n\nBut he also confirmed he wouldn't stand in the contest in a statement on Sunday night - leaving the pathway clear for Mr Swinney to take on the role.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stuart_mcfarlane@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Stuart McFarlane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire_North_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perthshire North (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Tweed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evelyn Tweed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyn_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alyn Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skye,_Lochaber_and_Badenoch_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_Scotland", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio Scotland"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32746421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_John-Swinney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

He added: \"We will set out our commitments as we take Budget decisions.\n\nPushed for a Yes/No answer by Mr Ross, the First Minister said: \"I've nothing really to add to Douglas Ross about the financial position we face.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Ross accused Mr Swinney of \"not being straight with the public\".\n\nWe told how parents took to the streets of Glasgow in protest at the SNP-led council's decision to axe 450 classroom posts.\n\nAnd campaigners raised fears over similar losses across Scotland as they urged the First Minister to step in and reverse the slashing of numbers.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who spoke with some of those who gathered in the city's George Square on Wednesday, said: \"Of the teachers I met, one told me they had re-trained two years ago and was now going to lose her job.\n\n\"Another hasn't been able to get a permanent contract since he qualified, and a third said this doesn't feel like the thanks and reward the Government promised them coming out of the pandemic.\n\n\"John Swinney bears responsibility for the broken finances in our councils and the decimation of our education system.\"\n\nAnd speaking after FMQs, Tory chief Mr Ross said: \"John Swinney's repeated failure to stand by the pre-election pledge he made as education secretary to increase teacher numbers will have been heard loud and clear across Scotland.\"\n\nAt a post-FMQs media briefing, a spokesman for the First Minister said Mr Swinney had shown \"complete candour\" about the financial pressures faced by the government.\n\nBut when pressed by The Scottish Sun on why the First Minister refused to give a straight Yes or No answer about whether the pledge will still be delivered, the spokesman said: \"He gave a commitment that he wanted to look very carefully at this and he wanted to engage with local authorities, and indeed, with parents and others.\"\n\nMr Swinney's inaugural FMQs in the top job came just days after he was officially confirmed as the new SNP leader and First Minister following the resignation of Humza Yousaf.\n\nIn a speech accepting the leadership of the SNP this week - having stood unopposed for the job - Mr Swinney vowed to adopt a different approach to politics and suggested nothing would be achieved by \"shouting at people\".\n\nAnd before FMQs, new Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes heaped praise on Mr Swinney, saying he had been \"truly inspiring\" over the past week.\n\nMr Swinney - Nicola Sturgeon's No2 during her entire tenure as First Minister - revealed a \"new\" cabinet with only one change, bringing in Ms Forbes as Deputy First Minister. But all of Humza Yousaf's top team stayed in place.\n\nAs she walked to the Holyrood chamber for FMQs, the Scottish Sun asked Ms Forbes about her waspish comments during the 2023 SNP leadership race in the wake of Ms Sturgeon's resignation that \"continuity won't cut it\", and how that squared with the virtually unchanged regime.\n\nShe said: \"Well, I was very clear in my statement last week about why I wasn't going to run.\n\n\"I had huge confidence in the agenda that John Swinney had set out about uniting the party and the country and ensuring that we work together to deliver on the priorities of the people of Scotland.\n\n\"That remains my position, and I think he has been truly inspiring in the speeches that he's given over the last week, doubling down on his commitments to unify, to deliver and to ultimately make sure that as a government we are delivering for people.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"},

Is he going to stick to his promise to increase teacher numbers by 3,500 in this parliament?\"\n\nMr Swinney stated that the teacher number commitments were given in \"good faith\" as he vowed to work with councils to deliver them.\n\nHe explained that public finances are under pressure due to inflation and the \"persistence of austerity\" from the UK government.\n\nMr Swinney said: \"But I assure Mr Ross and parents, most importantly in the city of Glasgow and around the country, of the government's commitment to sustained investment in education and to maximise the investment we can make available.\"\n\nMr Ross - putting the question to Mr Swinney four times - noted that the first minister failed to clearly answer whether he will keep his pledge of increasing teacher numbers by 3,500 this parliament term.\n\nMr Ross said: \"We were supposed to have a different style of politics, but it sounds like the excuses are the same as we've had before.\"\n\nThe Scottish Tory leader branded Mr Swinney's record in education as \"one of broken promises\".\n\nMr Ross said: \"He introduced a flagship education bill that could have improved standards - then he abandoned it.\n\n\"He promised a free laptop to every child - that never happened.\n\n\"Three years ago, the SNP said that Education Scotland would be reformed - nothing happened.\n\n\"The government he served in promised the SQA would be replaced - it is still there.\"\n\nMr Ross claimed the first minister was \"not being straight with the public\" and urged him to \"be \"honest and \"give a straight answer\".\n\nMr Swinney insisted teacher numbers rose while he was education secretary, as he listed some of the achievements made by his government - including the \"transformation of the educational estate in Scotland\" and \u00a3145m to support the recruitment of teachers.\n\nThe first minister stated: \"But on the question of the commitment to 3,500 teachers, I want to be absolutely clear with people in Scotland today.\n\n\"We face very significant financial pressures in Scotland in our public finances.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nSwinney unveils cabinet as Forbes becomes deputy\n\nSwinney axes minister for independence role\n\nHe said that his government will \"take forward its programme within the resources that are available to us\".\n\nMr Swinney added: \"But I have to make clear to people, to be straight with the public, which I will be, that public finances are under enormous pressure and we will set out our commitments as we take our budget decisions.\"\n\nThe first minister highlighted how he's only been in his new role for less than 48 hours.\n\nHe said with parliament he will be \"straight about the challenges that we face\", adding: \"But I'll also be straight with the people of Scotland about the successes that this government has delivered and which we are very proud of.\"\n\nFollowing FMQs, new Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes vowed to \"progress\" the rights of all communities in Scotland after the Scottish Greens urged Mr Swinney not to adopt the \"repressive values of the 1950s\".\n\nMs Forbes was criticised by Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie for her views on LGBT rights, gay marriage and abortion.\n\nMr Harvie raised concerns that the \"second most powerful job\" in the Scottish government had been given to someone \"who has opposed LGBT people's legal equality, expressed judgemental attitudes to abortion, and who has expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong\".\n\nHe asked: \"Is this the Scottish government's vision for the future of Scotland - taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s?\"\n\nMr Swinney defended Ms Forbes and insisted his minority SNP government would be a \"moderate left of centre\" administration.\n\nMs Forbes, a member of the Free Church of Scotland, later said: \"I am here to support the first minister and together we serve all communities in Scotland as we further and progress the rights of every community in Scotland, and I look forward to doing my part in achieving the government's aims in that regard.\n\n\"Not just that, but when I joined government yesterday in a clear role to support the first minister, I signed up to collective responsibility, so I stand by the government's decisions and agenda to improve and progress the rights of all of Scotland's communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type":

It is also \"progressive\" for a Highlander to stop placing wood in a stove to save the planet, while elsewhere 1,400 coal-fired power stations eliminate in seconds whatever gain in emissions that makes.\n\nNoticeably missing from Mr Greer's interview was any recognition of the profound damage being done to today's young people, and by extension to the nation in the years ahead, by SNP/Green decisions: \u00a3200m cuts to housing, cuts to primary and secondary education, cuts to universities, and the crisis created in the equally important further education colleges, as reported so accurately by you in your series last week (\"The State of Scotland's Colleges\", The Herald, April 29-May 4).\n\nAs I look at the condition of Scotland as a result of the SNP/Green Government, and realise how ill-prepared it has made the people of Scotland to rise to the challenge of creating a successful economy in this highly competitive world, and the social life dependent upon it, I have another word for Mr Greer's \"progressive\": stupid.\n\nEVEN after the SNP's annus horribilis, SNP acolytes continue to defend this failing party. Catriona C Clark (Letters, May 7) is one of many. She writes that John Swinney \"is to be commended\" for being in a cabinet responsible for baby boxes and increasing the benefits bill still further.\n\nMr Swinney promises a new beginning and a fresh start but he has more political barnacles on him than the Glen Sannox has real ones. He was part of the Sturgeon/Harvie/Yousaf cabal which inflicted all the green and transgender policies on Scotland. Did Mr Swinney oppose the gender transformation laws of Nicola Sturgeon's government? Of course he didn't. Does he support increasing the cost of whisky sold in Scotland by 30%? Yes, he does.\n\nDid Mr Swinney support Mr Harvie's Heat in Buildings strategy setting targets for scrapping gas and oil boilers and coal, wood and peat fires? He did, even as MSP for North Perthshire, which does not exactly enjoy a Mediterranean climate. Did he support the creation of targets from thin air to reduce Scotland's miniscule CO2 emissions even further? Yes, of course he did. Did he support the SNP target to cut car use by 20% by 2030? Yes.\n\nMr Swinney was part of a failed government. What is required is a fresh election to allow a new administration to take Scotland forward.\n\nWilliam Loneskie, Lauder.\n\nThe State of Scotland's Colleges: Find all articles in the series here\n\nRead more: Scottish Greens must return to the party's core principles\n\nRead more: SNP should have had its retread a decade ago. It's too late now\n\nJohn Swinney's credentials\n\nWHEN Steven Camley portrays John Swinney as a caretaker First Minister (The Herald, May 7), it is worth pointing out that John Swinney is 18 months younger than Sir Keir Starmer and went to a less-privileged state school at Forrester High School in Edinburgh. John Swinney's father was a garage manager while Keir Starmer's father owned an independent toolmaking firm. However, John Swinney has more experience in business through a five-year stint as a strategic planning principal with a Life Assurance company.\n\nAs for unelected leaders, unlike at Westminster our First Minister must be an MSP and elected by Holyrood members. As both Anas Sarwar and Douglas Ross were merely elected via the party list back door in 2021, they are hardly in a position to complain.\n\nMeanwhile, when Jackie Baillie calls for more teeth for Holyrood (\"Labour's longest-serving MSP Baillie says Holyrood needs 'more teeth'\", The Herald, May 7), she fails to mention any additional powers for our Scottish Parliament in order to tackle the cost of living crisis or labour shortages and economic stagnation under a UK outside the EU supported by the Labour Party. Given the number of policy U-turns, the main change Labour is planning at Westminster is to replace a multi-millionaire with a mere millionaire.\n\nJOHN Swinney should seize the opportunity to deliver on the vision of the devolved Scottish Parliament as a chamber in which no single party should be able to gain total control.\n\nIt was only the sense of betrayal felt by Scottish LibDem voters when their party went into coalition with the Tories in 2010 and the knowledge that Labour was shaping up to go into alliance with the Tories and LibDems against Scottish independence that produced the SNP landslide in 2011. John Swinney now has the chance to form a government along the lines likely to emerge in an independent Scotland.\n\nAnas Sarwar could be offered the job of Health Secretary where he so clearly believes he could succeed where the SNP has failed. Douglas Ross could be given a similar challenge with the education portfolio and Alex Cole-Hamilton might be able to pull some ferries out of the hat. I'll leave Mr Swinney to decide who should handle other issues such as net zero and drug deaths.\n\nFinally I would urge the SNP and Alba to withdraw from contesting Westminster seats and for all independence supporters, regardless of party allegiance, to unite by voting for candidates standing \"Under One Banner\" in Westminster elections with a single-issue manifesto of Scottish independence.\n\nYOU report that Israel has rejected the ceasefire agreement proposed by Egypt and Qatar and accepted by Hamas (\"Israel says ceasefire terms 'not enough'\",The Herald, May 7). Today's news bulletins report that Israel has started bombing Rafah, as it has threatened to do for weeks. Is anyone, other than perhaps Joe Biden, surprised by these latest developments?\n\nWhen it first invaded last October, Israel said it would destroy Gaza City, but told its inhabitants they would be safe if they moved south to Khan Yunis and beyond. That was a lie. Later, Israel said it would destroy Khan Yunis, but told its inhabitants and the multitude of refugees from Gaza City they would be safe if they moved south to Rafah, hard up against the border with Egypt. That was also a lie: they now intend destroying Rafah, with the inevitable loss of thousands of innocent lives.\n\nThe worst human conditions I've ever seen were in Ethiopia during the great famine of 1984. I'll never forget some of the children I saw there, skeletal and close to death. The media blamed drought for the famine, but there was more to it than that. There was civil war in Ethiopia at the time, between rebels in the north and a brutal Marxist regime in Addis Ababa. The worst of the famine was in the north and that suited the Marxists just fine: they had little interest in the survival of women and children in rebel areas and exploited the famine to advance their war effort. I recognised that same indifference to suffering, in a much less extreme situation, in Mrs Thatcher's response to mining communities fighting to survive that same year.\n\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris said: \"Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.\" That was in December. Since then, thousands more innocents have been killed by Israeli forces using American bombs and shells. The Israeli government is worse than the Ethiopian Marxists; at least the latter allowed a substantial amount of foreign aid into the country. So why on earth is the US, which prides itself on being a beacon of democracy and human rights, so deaf and blind to the situation in Gaza? Children are children; wherever they live, they don't deserve to be killed or maimed by munitions made in America.\n\nDoug Maughan, Dunblane.\n\n* IT is sad to see how so many in Israel endorse what is going on in Gaza.\n\nThey accuse outsiders of anti-Semitism while failing to understand the depth of anger and resentment that has fuelled Palestinian hostility to Israel.\n\nThey fail too to appreciate the appalling death toll that the war has wrought on Palestinians in Gaza, the shocking destruction and what can only be described as collective punishment and revenge.\n\nIt does the Israeli government no credit to talk tirelessly of anti-Semitism in a knee-jerk reaction to the slightest criticism of its actions.\n\nHamas is widely considered a terrorist organisation and its actions last October more than justify the accusation, but there are state actors, too: there is state terrorism and we shouldn't be afraid to call it out.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com",

It was a familiar tale: the bravura about the \"Saudi Arabia of renewables\" unmatched by any strategy for the Scottish economy on which a \"just transition\" will depend. So the vast majority of the work goes overseas.\n\nSince this was the day of John Swinney's audacious coronation, these were timely reminders of how Scotland has been run for years. Boasts, lies and empty promises have been the currency of government. From ferries via attainment gaps to NHS waiting lists, votes were garnered through headlines with scant regard for days of reckoning.\n\nA permanent presence through all of this was one John Ramsay Swinney, a Member of the Scottish Parliament since its inception 25 years ago and for 16 years a loyal partisan on behalf of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon; a dismally poor Education Secretary and, as a crowning glory, his party's negotiator in creating a coalition with the Scottish Greens.\n\nREAD MORE: Swinney as FM? What a democratic outrage that would be\n\nREAD MORE: The Greens con: this is a cult, not a serious political party\n\nREAD MORE: This woodburning stove ban is an assault on the rural poor\n\nNobody would question Mr Swinney's consistency. His lifelong cause is Scottish independence and everything in his political career was subordinate to that objective, which is a perfectly respectable personal history, even if one disagrees. It has required a lot of dirty work at various crossroads with protection of the SNP always his first priority, transcending any public interest or \"right to know\". That too is understandable in such a committed political partisan even if it turned the soubriquet \"Honest John\" into a term of irony.\n\nSo far, so good. But please, Mr Swinney, as he enters his seventh decade, spare us the pretence that anything has changed or that a Pauline conversion to \"reaching out\" has occurred; far less penitence about his own contribution to Scotland's \"intensely polarised environment\". The purpose of Mr Swinney's political calling has, for 40 years, been to drive division over Scotland's constitutional position, above and beyond all else, in the hope of one day coming out on top. Again, perfectly respectable if, in the view of most Scots, misguided. But it sure ain't going to change now.\n\nPretending his fundamentalism has been subordinated within the space of a week to higher-minded motivations is just another tactic which should be responded to with corresponding degrees of caution. Mr Swinney has got the top job because the SNP hierarachy needed him to get rid of Mr Yousaf, escape from the Greens and keep out Kate Forbes. Nobody else was available to fulfil these interim objectives though, naturally, the longer-term aim is to keep the Nationalists in power.\n\nFor anyone who wants divisions in Scotland to heal and for politics to become focused on outcomes, the first essential prerequisite is not to prop up Mr Swinney but to remove him and his colleagues at the earliest opportunity. That was true last week and it remains true this week. The childish talk of clean sheets and fresh starts is for the birds. You can't have a fresh start which involves the same people who have been around for the past 17 years and created the conditions which now exist.\n\nTake education. Not only has the SNP had 17 years to drive forward the quality of Scottish education and close attainment gaps, Mr Swinney personally had five years as Education Secretary. Not only did he fail in these objectives but he became standard bearer for the Named Person scheme which was delayed for three years, cost untold millions of pounds and ended up being blown away by the Supreme Court as a breach of Human Rights. As in many matters, Mr Swinney's characteristic in this folly was a complete refusal to listen, even to people with expertise who were not politically hostile.\n\nJohn Swinney was the standard bearer for the failed Named Persons scheme (Image: PA)\n\nFew would disagree that Scottish education is at a low ebb. The international comparators published last December were described as \"catastrophic\" - even more so for the children from the poorest backgrounds. This is after 17 years. There is not a shred of evidence to support any contention that the best bet for Scottish education is to leave it in the hands of the same party, led by Mr Swinney, that dragged it down to this level in the first place.\n\nWhat Mr Swinney is really begging for, driven solely by the arithmetic of Holyrood, is not so much forgiveness as collective amnesia. All the political parties (except the Greens who are now to be kept at a safe distance in a separate room) are invited to join hands, think of Scotland and make life easy for Mr Swinney. On the contrary, their duty on behalf of voters who want shot of the SNP is to tell him to get on his bike and do his begging to Patrick Harvie.\n\nThe prerequisites for an effective, progressive Scottish government are (a) to have a single-minded devotion to using the enormous resources available in order to produce real change and (b) to work constructively with the government of the United Kingdom, regardless of political complexion, to optimise outcomes for Scotland. Neither of these is rocket science but equally, neither is possible under a Nationalist administration at Holyrood - because it will always have at least one eye on its primary objective which involves demonstrating the \"need\" for independence.\n\nThat is exactly the lesson of the last 17, and particularly the last 10, years within which John Swinney has been a fixture. Throw in the Green-assisted absurdities of the past few years and again, you find him at the centre of the plot. None of this can be wished away with platitudes or faux sincerity. As Aneurin Bevan put it: \"You don't have to gaze into a crystal ball when you can read an open book\".\n\nBrian Wilson is a former Labour Party politician.

For once, he's not the same as the old boss.\n\nJohn Swinney faced a grilling from party leaders on Thursday as he took part in his first session of First Minister's Questions as that self-same First Minister.\n\nHe's been around this block many, many times before - as a member of the Scottish Government, he served as education secretary and finance secretary and Deputy First Minster.\n\nHe's been an MSP for sixteen years and has seen all six previous First Ministers come and go. He even stood in this very spot as a substitute for Nicola Sturgeon when she was called away on other duties.\n\nThis was not new ground for the veteran SNP stalwart. But things are different when it's you in the spotlight, and curious eyes tuned in to see how the man at the top of the table handled the pressure.\n\nShort answer: it didn't trouble him at all. There were laughs, there was heartfelt emotion. There was even time for an arithmetic lesson.\n\nIt was nothing like the FMQs of the past 12 months when Humza Yousaf sought to defend his party's record against all comers.\n\nFM warns of 'enormous financial pressure' as he refuses to commit to new teacher vow\n\nFirst up was Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who tried to pin Mr Swinney on an SNP pledge to increase teacher numbers, at a time when cuts are being made to education budgets.\n\nThis line of questioning would have had Yousaf rifling through his Big Book of FMQ Answers, before falling back on his oft-repeated strategy of hollering about the dastardly Tories at Westminster, and their own woeful record on whatever topic he was discussing.\n\n(When especially flustered, Mr Yousaf would question Mr Ross's own part in these iniquitous affairs or his support for Boris Johnson - on the grounds that always seemed to go down well with the SNP faithful.)\n\nNot so Mr Swinney, who calmly deflected Mr Ross' questions with an explanation of how skint the Scottish Government is, thanks to austerity and inflation.\n\nNo fire, no brimstone. No bother. He even took the Conservative leader to school with an impromptu class on how the value of money decreases when inflation rises - though he did blame inflationary pressures on the Tories down south. Some things never change in politics.\n\nYou could tell he was an education secretary. This was schoolmaster Swinney, the dusty voice of reason and debate putting the facts into FMQs.\n\nThe topic of education, and, more widely, the SNP's failures in this field, were also the subject Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar chose to go in on.\n\nGlasgow City Council has begun to slash teacher numbers by 450, putting pressure on those left behind and sparking fears among the newly qualified that their jobs are on the line. Would the new First Minister intervene?\n\nMr Swinney stressed that the Scottish Government would not. It doesn't tell local authorities what to do. But it would work with Glasgow \"constructively\". This may become a byword of Mr Swinney's time in charge.\n\nMr Sarwar pressed on, widening his attack to the SNP's record in government and decrying \"more of the same\" from Mr Swinney's well-kent face.\n\nUnspun | Analysis: Why is partisan John Swinney now striving to be Holyrood peacemaker?\n\nThen the new First Minister did something his predecessor never managed in one of these argy-bargy sessions, and united the house in intentioned laughter.\n\nWith an almost straight face, he told the Scottish Labour leader: \"I've got good news for Mr Sarwar - the fresh leadership has just arrived.\"\n\nSelf-deprecating humour? Yousaf never tried that. Swinney the stand-up comedian wasn't something anyone expected, but it worked - taking the sting out of Mr Sarwar's barbs and sending him chuckling back to his seat to think again. He'll have to work on his one-liners.\n\nNot so easily dealt with was the next, and last, party leader to question the First Minister.\n\nScottish Green leader Patrick Harvie had a pretty big hand in Yousaf's downfall, and is now grappling with the law of unintended consequences, in the shape of the socially conservative - to put it mildly - new Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes.\n\nMr Harvie said that the appointment of Ms Forbes, an opponent of same-sex marriage and having children out of wedlock, had put the fear of God into those of an LGBT persuasion.\n\nHe said: \"The second most powerful job in government given to someone who has opposed LGBT people's legal equality, who's expressed judgmental attitudes against abortion, and has even expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong.\"\n\nMr Harvie asked: \"Is this the Scottish Government's vision for the future of Scotland? Taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s?\"\n\nNow we saw Swinney the statesman. The First Minister replied: \"I take very seriously the challenge that Mr Harvie puts to me. I want people to be reassured in this country by my leadership.\n\n\"When I saw I want to be the First Minister for everyone in Scotland, I deeply mean that. I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland. A place for everybody, where everybody feels at home, at peace, that they have a place.\n\n\"And that their place in our society is protected by my leadership.\"", "source": {"uri":

meeting NFU Scotland president Martin Kennedy and local farmers following severe flooding in highland Perthshire \u00a9 NFU Scotland\n\nScottish farm leaders have congratulated John Swinney on becoming the seventh first minister for Scotland, and vowed to work together to strengthen the agricultural industry.\n\nMr Swinney, 60, was elected as leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) on 6 May after no other candidates were put forward.\n\nHis term as first minister for Scotland started on Wednesday 8 May after incumbent Humza Yousaf formally resigned a day earlier.\n\nSee also: Time for 'policy reset' as SNP and Scottish Greens part ways\n\nFarming and crofting organisations said they look forward to working with Mr Swinney, deputy first minister Kate Forbes and his new Cabinet to improve future prospects for the agricultural industry in Scotland.\n\nNFU Scotland president Martin Kennedy said: \"I congratulate John Swinney MSP on his appointment.\n\n\"He is a politician that NFU Scotland has worked well with both nationally and locally over many years.\n\n\"The first minister, coming from a rural constituency, is well aware that agriculture underpins rural communities across Scotland and is at the heart of flourishing environments.\n\n\"High-quality agricultural production is vital to the wider food and drink industry - a sector that is worth more than \u00a316bn to the Scottish economy, employs over 130,000 people, and supports Scotland's national reputation on the world stage.\"\n\nSLE reaction\n\nSarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of landowners' organisation Scottish Land & Estates, said: \"We hope a change in leadership brings the opportunity for rural Scotland, its communities and businesses to have a greater voice in rural policymaking.\n\n\"We have worked with Mr Swinney during his past roles in Cabinet and we look forward to a pragmatic, evidence-based approach in the coming years under his direction.\n\n\"Between land reform, the Agriculture Bill shaping future farming subsidies, changes to deer management, a new Housing Bill and various other issues such as natural capital, forestry and peatland restoration, there is substantial change on the horizon.\n\n\"We were pleased to hear his stated focus on the economy and jobs - land-based businesses want to work positively with the Scottish government and we hope the new first minister will enable that to happen.\"\n\nPower-sharing collapse\n\nMr Yousaf resigned four days after the power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Scottish Greens collapsed amid a bitter row over climate targets.\n\nExplaining his decision to end the Bute House agreement with the Scottish Greens, Mr Yousaf said it had \"served its purpose\" and was \"no longer guaranteeing a stable arrangement in parliament\".\n\nBut Scottish Conservative shadow rural affairs minister Rachael Hamilton MSP accused Mr Yousaf and the SNP of \"an overwhelming failure to deliver any future clarity for our farmers on what future support will look like\".\n\nNFU Scotland outlines farming priorities\n\nNFU Scotland has wasted no time in setting out its demands for a better farm support policy, writing to new first minister John Swinney on his first day in office.\n\nThe union has stressed the need for agriculture to be part of the government's growth agenda, while seeking an enhanced budget on a multi-annual basis.\n\nFor \u00a3550m in public support for agriculture, the sector delivered \u00a33.3bn in Scottish agricultural output, said the letter.\n\nThe union says these recommendations are needed for a \"profitable and sustainable agricultural sector that underpins the future prosperity of Scotland\".\n\nNFU Scotland has also requested an opportunity to meet with the first minister.\n\nSee more Farm policyNews", "source": {"uri": "fwi.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Farmers Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philip_case@fwi.co.uk", "name": "Philip Case", "type":

The government I lead will maximise every lever at our disposal to tackle the scourge of poverty in our country.\n\n\"A strong economy supports the delivery of services on which people depend - health, education, housing, and transport - and so each of these areas are aligned to distinct roles in my Cabinet, with a focus on ensuring people see their lives improve as a result of the actions of their Scottish Government.\n\n\"I believe that Scotland's future is best served as an independent country - but I recognise more people need to be convinced of that before independence can be achieved. My Cabinet will also focus efforts on reaching out to those who remain unconvinced, with respect and courtesy, to ensure that the people of Scotland have the democratic right to choose their own future.\"\n\nScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: \"This is simply Humza Yousaf's cabinet with a different figurehead.\n\n\"The return of Kate Forbes is a desperate attempt by both John Swinney and his new deputy to gloss over the huge splits in the SNP and fixate on independence.\n\n\"A year ago, Mr Swinney questioned whether Kate Forbes was an 'appropriate individual' to lead the SNP, but now he deems her fit to be his second in command.\n\n\"Similarly, Ms Forbes, who warned that 'continuity won't cut it', has now joined a Cabinet with continuity at its core in return for a top job under Nicola Sturgeon's right-hand man.\n\n\"This uninspiring cabinet is further evidence that John Swinney as First Minister will just mean more of the same.\n\n\"His fingerprints are all over the failed SNP policies that have damaged Scotland, while he's already doubled down on the SNP's independence obsession, instead of focusing on the public's real priorities such as fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy.\n\n\"When the election comes, voters will have the chance to punish the feuding, failing, distracted SNP and get the focus back on the issues that matter - and, in key seats across Scotland, it's only the Scottish Conservatives who can beat them.\"\n\nScottish Labour Deputy Leader Jackie Baillie said: \"Once again the SNP is putting its own party interest before the country's interest with this uninspiring reshuffle.\n\n\"After 17 years of failure, every single institution in Scotland is now weaker and those responsible remain at the heart of government.\n\n\"This is a continuity cabinet, that cannot be trusted to fix the chaos and instability they have created.\n\n\"With two of the former Finance Secretaries responsible for trashing public finances now in the top jobs, more SNP chaos lies ahead.\n\n\"Scotland needs change and the people of Scotland know continuity won't cut it - we need an election.\n\n\"Only Scottish Labour can put a stop to the division and decline of the SNP and deliver the fresh start our country needs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Government has shared details of a conversation between Mr Swinney and Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe two men spoke on Wednesday afternoon, with the First Minister saying he \"stands ready to work constructively with the UK Government in a good-faith effort to deliver for the people of Scotland and reduce polarisation in politics.\"\n\nA spokesperson said Mr Swinney \"set out his determination to eradicate child poverty and urged the UK Government to work with him towards that goal by changing course on policies such as the two-child benefit cap which are causing misery for many families in Scotland.\"\n\nHe also said the the First Minister made clear that the Scottish Government \"will continue to respectfully persuade people in Scotland of the case for independence, and that the decision on Scotland's future should be for the people of Scotland to make.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person",

John Swinney has this afternoon become Scotland's seventh First Minister after being appointed, unopposed, as SNP leader on Monday. It was a coronation event like no other - where Swinney was threatened by a contest from a rank and file activist within his own party after hapless Humza Yousaf paved the way to his own resignation. Now, the veteran Nat and former SNP leader has swooped into government from the backbenches in a move that some hint was a little more scripted than first thought...\n\nToday, Swinney faced off challenges for the top job from the leaders of the Scottish Labour party, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats in a ceremony rather, er, similar to one that took place just over 12 months ago. As Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton tweeted earlier, 'it's that time of year again'. All accepted they were not going to win the title; all made clear why they didn't think Swinney should either.\n\nAnd the veteran nationalist had his appointment made more than a little awkward for him today. Using his one asset - experience - against him, Douglas Ross and Anas Sarwar were quick to dig up quotes from Swinney's heyday that contained some rather eery foreshadowing...\n\n'We meet this afternoon to elect a new First Minister - for the third time in this parliament,' the Scottish Labour leader announced to the Chamber.\n\nThe third occasion is the result of a farce: a farce inflicted on Scotland and its parliament by - on this occasion the SNP - and by absolutely nobody else... The party that now, without any democratic process, seeks to foist is unelected leader upon our country; the party that promotes its own by making cronyism a way of life - always lets Scotland down. This afternoon, the farce may be carried to its illogical conclusion.\n\nNot, in fact, Sarwar's words, but a quote adapted from Swinney himself back in 2001. Golly.\n\nThe Scottish Tory leader joined in with the antics, telling the Chamber:\n\nIt seems pretty likely that the leader of the largest minority party in parliament, with the help of the fourth largest minority party, will be successful in this afternoon's election.\n\nNot Ross's utterances but, you guessed it, Swinney's. 'It is interesting to see John Swinney back, seeking the support of this parliament, more than two decades on from his previous attempt,' the Scottish Conservative MSP mocked the new SNP chief, as Swinney struggled to contain a smirk himself.\n\n'The old joke about giving a busy man more to do seems relevant at the moment,' the nationalist leader quipped in return. Quite.

The notes he's hit have been pitch-perfect to many ears.\n\nHe's rejected tribalism, said he'd govern for \"everyone in Scotland\", shown a degree of vulnerability when speaking of his personal exhaustion, was honest in his assessment of Holyrood dysfunction, held up his hands admitting his part in polarisation, and promised to focus on what matters: the economy, jobs, the cost of living, the NHS, schools, and child poverty.\n\nThe tributes he paid to his wife, who has multiple sclerosis, were the very model of modern manhood: empathetic, emotionally aware, and drained of braggadocio.\n\nHowever, one can admire an individual's personal qualities and still doubt their wisdom. For Swinney's positioning on independence is a trap waiting to spring and destroy his premiership. He could well become Scotland's shortest-served First Minister unless he changes tack.\n\nHe is wedded to Humza Yousaf's independence strategy. In doing so, he makes himself hostage to an absurd policy.\n\nThe word \"strategy\" has no place attached to the SNP's childish independence plan. It involves the SNP winning the majority of Scottish seats at the next General Election. This, apparently, would allow the Scottish Government to begin negotiations for either independence or another referendum.\n\nThe party's veteran MP Pete Wishart rightly brands it a \"total mess\". There's so much wrong with this \"policy'\" First, the SNP will likely face a walloping from Labour. Latest polling shows the party holding just 15 of its 43 seats, with Scottish Labour taking 28.\n\nSo Swinney is backing a policy consistently undermined by polling. That's just the electoral mathematics. The political strategy is worse.\n\nEven if the SNP were to win a majority of seats - which clearly isn't a majority of votes - are we to imagine that newly-installed Prime Minister Starmer will agree to a referendum which, if he lost, would force him to resign?\n\nIf Swinney goes into a General Election on a manifesto pledge that he will win a majority of seats, thereby triggering independence or another referendum, and fails, then he's done.\n\nHe would become a victim of his own orderly style of leadership. How could a man of honour not step down in the event of failing to meet his key electoral promise? Swinney would cease to be a man of honour if he remained in office.\n\nWhy would he do this to himself? Why would he do this to Scotland if he thinks he can turn the ship of state around? This egregious scheme seems to undermine everything he represents.\n\nREAD MORE BY NEIL MACKAY:\n\nHatred of the SNP and the left is now at absurd levels of radicalisation\n\nSwinney wanted an election when Tories changed leader, he should face one himself\n\nHumza Yousaf deserves to fall and Scotland deserves an election\n\nEvidently, Swinney may well be banking on reversing polls. He may hope that by the time the General Election comes the chaos that's engulfed the Scottish Government for quite some time will be waning in memories and those who drifted despondently to Labour will be returning to the SNP.\n\nWell, as our grandmothers told us: \"You know what hope did.\" If Swinney tacks to the right economically, he won't win back soft independence voters considering voting Labour. If more feuding breaks out in the SNP - and that's as likely as the sunrise these days - then his claims of stable government are dust. If he fails to break the polarisation in parliament and cannot pass legislation as a minority government, then his promises are hollow.\n\nThere are lots of moving parts for Swinney to consider. He does not want a spoke going through his wheel, and his independence strategy is a spoke as big as a tree trunk.\n\nThe biggest problem he faces is that in order to keep his indy pledge he needs to maintain the SNP's hunger for campaigning rather than governing. The public doesn't want more \"hopes and dreams\", more politicians distracted by imagined utopias.\n\nThe public want some jam on the bread. Nor will more indy campaigning be a mark of a politician governing for \"everyone in Scotland'\" it would simply further the nation's divide.\n\nLabour should be cringing at their role in dethroning Humza Yousaf and helping crown Swinney. With Yousaf in power the General Election would have been a much easier battle.\n\nSwinney presents real challenges to Labour. But his indy strategy gives solace to Anas Sarwar. It's not just a fracture point for Swinney, but a possible trigger for his own resignation.\n\nSwinney's fall would usher in more chaos inside the SNP ahead of the Holyrood election, playing straight into Labour's hands.\n\nWill John Swinney dump Humza Yousaf's independence plan? (Image: PA)\n\nSNP supporters can only hope that Swinney - as a now very busy man - is simply using Yousaf's old strategy as a holding pattern, and will soon dump it.\n\nHe has acknowledged independence isn't \"frustratingly close\" as Yousaf said while resigning. So his commitment to his predecessor's independence policy is bizarre.\n\nIndependence - which I support - remains distant. The SNP hasn't done the work to improve what independence means since 2014.\n\nThe party should have governed its way to independence by preforming so well the public could see the benefits of Scotland striking out alone. Instead, nationalists governed miserably. Independence support hasn't shifted since 2014.\n\nSwinney should say that independence is off the table until his party raises support to 60% over a prolonged period. When that happens, he can confront the UK Government in a showdown for the right to a referendum with the people of Scotland behind him.\n\nDumping the current absurd indy plan would allow Swinney to go into an election, he may very well lose, with the ability to survive defeat. He would be able to say that he'd done his best against a backdrop of chaos, without being honour-bound to resign over the independence plan.\n\nIf Swinney cannot see this, then he's not the man of clear-sighted intelligence Scotland needs right now.\n\nHe has vowed he'll be no \"interim leader\". However, this dismal independence strategy is the very policy to ensure that he is remembered by the one word he rejects: 'caretaker'.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Wishart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Wishart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Next United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiple sclerosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Crimean status referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18056795/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The Liberal Democrats abstained, giving Swinney a narrow majority because some opposition MSPs were absent.\n\nThe dispute opens up a fresh rift between the Scottish government's former coalition partners and the first minister, Swinney, the day after he confirmed Forbes would be his deputy and also deleted the post of minister for independence.\n\nSwinney appointed Forbes partly in return for her dropping her bid to stand against him for the Scottish National party's leadership, but chiefly to signal to disenchanted voters the SNP was shifting back to the political centre ground before the general election.\n\nThe row over Forbes's conservative evangelical beliefs, based on Free Church of Scotland teachings, erupted at first minister's questions. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens' co-leader, said her appointment signalled a return \"to the repressive values of the 1950s\".\n\nSwinney rejected Harvie's criticisms. He said Forbes had presided over progressive tax changes and the introduction of the Scottish child payment while finance secretary. The first minister, who like Greer is a member of the Church of Scotland, said he took Harvie's challenges \"very seriously\".\n\n\"When I say that I want to be the first minister for everyone in Scotland, I deeply mean that,\" Swinney added. \"I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, a place for everybody. Where everybody feels at home, at peace, that they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\"\n\nGreer dismissed those reassurances. He said that he, Forbes and Swinney all believed in Christ, and that he knew Swinney \"shares in the joy\" that LGBT people felt about Scotland's equal marriage reforms.\n\n\"Faith is not the issue here,\" he added. \"The issue is that I am being asked to vote for someone who thinks there is something wrong with me, not because of any views I hold but simply because of who I am.\n\n\"Yesterday Kate Forbes was given the opportunity to reassure LGBT people in a question asked by ITV News. She did not. The first minister had to step in just to say the word LGBT.\"\n\nGreer added that over the last few years it felt as if Scotland \"was going backwards\" on LGBT rights. It was a reference to the bitter disputes over gender recognition and transgender rights, which Swinney's advisers believe have lost them centre-ground voters.\n\nThe Greens claim the former first minister Humza Yousaf's disastrous decision to scrap the Bute House agreement between the SNP and the Greens which precipitated his resignation, and Forbes's re-emergence in government, has led SNP members to defect to the Greens.\n\nHarvie's co-leader, Lorna Slater, told BBC Radio Scotland her party was experiencing a \"surge\" in membership, \"particularly people in the LGBTQ+ community [who] are now looking at the SNP and thinking: 'Oh my goodness, is this really the home for me?'\"\n\nAlyn Smith, an SNP MP who has championed gay equality within his party, defended the principle of Forbes's appointment. \"Scotland's a big tent but we're too small a community to exclude people, and people of faith should have a role in politics,\" he told the same programme.\n\nForbes's position on equality issues was \"a matter for her to work through her conscience\", he said.\n\nLater on Thursday, Out for Indy - the SNP's affiliate group for LGBTQ+ members - issued a statement asking for \"urgent clarification\" from Swinney and Forbes that policies such as the forthcoming ban on conversion practices \"will not be stalled or removed from the programme for government\".\n\nThe statement added: \"At a time when the LGBTQ+ community - especially trans people - face unprecedented violence and attacks both within and outwith politics, more needs to be done to reassure the community - and to assure that the SNP's legacy of fighting for LGBTQ+ rights is not undermined.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ SNP members have told the Guardian they have profound concerns about the \"direction of

The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch had been identified by Ms \u00adSturgeon as a rising star and set on the fast-track to the top.\n\nBut days into her campaign, Ms Forbes made a schoolgirl error in the world of Nationalist politics: she was asked a question to which she gave an honest answer.\n\nMs Forbes, a member of the socially conservative Free Church of Scotland, admitted that, if she had been a member of the Scottish parliament at the time the matter was being considered, she would have voted against gay marriage.\n\nSuddenly, Ms Forbes was no longer the Sturgeon-championed embodiment of a bright new future but a pariah to be shunned. Horrified senior SNP figures briefed heavily that victory for the young Christian - 34 last month - would be a disaster. She would drag their glorious, progressive party back into the dark ages.\n\nKate Forbes arrives at Bute House after First Minister John Swinney was sworn in at the Court of Session\n\nThat Humza Yousaf, a Muslim, had been an MSP at the time of equal marriage legislation and had not participated in the final vote was brushed away. Sure, he might not have voted but, don't forget, Ms Forbes said she'd have voted against. Didn't that make her much worse?\n\nIn the end, Ms Forbes couldn't defeat SNP establishment favourite Mr Yousaf. But the margin of his victory - 52 per cent to 48 per cent - showed her social conservatism wasn't as out of step with voters as her colleagues might have told themselves.\n\nOne of Mr Yousaf's first \u00addecisions on becoming First Minister showed how insecure he was about Ms Forbes's presence in the upper echelons of the SNP. Rather than having the confidence to bring her into a senior role, he offered her a demotion which - sensibly - she rejected.\n\nWhen, after his disastrous handling of the end of the power-sharing agreement between the SNP and the Greens, Mr Yousaf resigned as First Minister, a week and a half ago, he resurrected the 'Forbes problem'.\n\nAssisted by having been nowhere near Mr Yousaf's government, Ms Forbes was immediately named a frontrunner to become Scotland's seventh First Minister.\n\nCue an outbreak of conniptions across the SNP. There was no way Scotland, a Christian country, could have an openly Christian leader. This was a disaster waiting to happen. Senior figures worried that years of telling a story of Scotland as uniquely progressive and radical would be forgotten with the election of Ms Forbes.\n\nWhen Mr Swinney announced, last Thursday, his intention to stand for the leadership of the SNP, he spoke about this being the right decision for his party and for Scotland.\n\nThis was all terribly noble and moving but the truth was - and will be for the duration of his leadership - that he scrapped his retirement plans to stop Ms Forbes becoming First Minister.\n\nSenior SNP figures - including Ms Sturgeon - urged Mr Swinney to step forward and end the prospect of a Forbes-led party.\n\nYou might think that, for Mr Swinney to have decided the idea of Ms Forbes as First Minister was so unthinkable that he stood for a job he didn't actually want, she must be unusually unsuited to the world of politics. But, as is so often the case when it comes to the SNP, things don't have to make a great deal of sense.\n\nAnd so, yesterday, Mr Swinney announced that Ms Forbes - who he last year wondered whether was an 'appropriate individual' to lead his party - is to be his Deputy First Minister.\n\nA major reason supporters of Ms Sturgeon were so vehemently opposed to Ms Forbes becoming party leader was her opposition to plans to reform the Gender Recognition Act to allow people to self-ID into the sex of their choosing.\n\nMs Forbes shares the concerns of many who believe changing the law would undermine the rights of women and girls.\n\nMr Swinney has said he will work across political divides to take forward his government's agenda. Given their position on gender issue - some MSPs are angry that the NHS has stopped giving experimental, life-altering 'puberty blocker' drugs to children confused about their gender - the Scottish Greens are unlikely to be in the mood to co-operate.\n\nThis would be one very positive outcome from the SNP-generated chaos engulfing Scottish politics.\n\nThe Greens are no longer a credible party of the environment. Now they are cranks, encouraging the reckless medical treatment of children and denouncing anyone who disagrees as a bigot.\n\nThe return of Kate Forbes to government in such a senior position may help the SNP move away from the fringes and back to the political centre where it might start to deal with the things - such as the NHS, education and the economy - that matter to voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the crumbling government is held together by a First Minister who didn't want the job and a deputy so divisive that many of her Cabinet colleagues devoted much of the past two weeks to briefing heavily against her.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Every one of us. I hope those comments, which are more forthright about faith than I have ever uttered in my 45 years in politics, will perhaps illustrate to Parliament the magnitude of the seriousness with which I take the issues that Mr Greer puts to me.\"\n\nScottish Tory deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said her party does not support the ministerial appointments.\n\nShe said: \"Instead, we are putting down a marker that this Government must change its approach.\n\n\"The Scottish Conservatives will take every opportunity to oppose this SNP Government and its obsession with independence, but this does not mean that we are not above working with other parties across Parliament to deliver on the real priorities of the Scottish people.\"\n\nScottish Labour's Martin Whitfield said: \"I fear the ambition to work in Scotland's best interests is lacking in this Government.\n\n\"After 17 years of failure, every single institution in Scotland is weaker and those responsible still remain at the heart of Government.\n\n\"Our country needs effective leadership. While I wish genuinely all the ministers who are appointed today well, I feel the task ahead is beyond them.\"\n\nHowever, Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said his party would not block the appointments.\n\nHe said: \"We may have a difference of views on equalities, but Kate Forbes does deserve a chance to govern putting those views to one side.\"\n\nThe rest of Mr Swinney's Cabinet is largely unchanged from that under his predecessor Humza Yousaf, with former deputy first minister Shona Robison remaining in the finance brief.\n\nThe minister for independence role has been dropped, with Jamie Hepburn who held the post moved to minister for parliamentary business.\n\nThe ministerial reshuffle saw George Adam, Emma Roddick and Joe Fitzpatrick step down from their roles.\n\nConsisting of 11 Cabinet secretaries, including the First Minister, the Scottish Cabinet is supported by 14 ministers, reducing the size of the Scottish Government by four since the start of

The Liberal Democrats abstained, giving Swinney a narrow majority because some opposition MSPs were absent.\n\nThe dispute opens up a fresh rift between the Scottish government's former coalition partners and the first minister, John Swinney, the day after he confirmed Forbes would be his deputy and also deleted the post of minister for independence.\n\nSwinney appointed Forbes partly in return for dropping her bid to stand against him for the Scottish National party's leadership, but chiefly to signal to disenchanted voters the SNP was shifting back to the political centre ground before the general election.\n\nThe row over Forbes's conservative evangelical beliefs, based on Free Church of Scotland teachings, erupted at first minister's questions. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens' co-leader, said her appointment signalled a return \"to the repressive values of the 1950s\".\n\nSwinney rejected Harvie's criticisms. He said Forbes had presided over progressive tax changes and the introduction of the Scottish child payment while finance secretary. The first minister, who like Greer is a member of the Church of Scotland, said he took Harvie's challenges \"very seriously\".\n\n\"When I say that I want to be the first minister for everyone in Scotland, I deeply mean that,\" Swinney added. \"I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, a place for everybody. Where everybody feels at home, at peace, that they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\"\n\nGreer dismissed those reassurances. He said that he, Forbes and Swinney all believed in Christ, and that he knew Swinney \"shares in the joy\" that LGBT people felt about Scotland's equal marriage reforms.\n\n\"Faith is not the issue here,\" he added. \"The issue is that I am being asked to vote for someone who thinks there is something wrong with me, not because of any views I hold but simply because of who I am.\n\n\"Yesterday Kate Forbes was given the opportunity to reassure LGBT people in a question asked by ITV News. She did not. The first minister had to step in just to say the word LGBT.\"\n\nGreer added that over the last few years it felt as if Scotland \"was going backwards\" on LGBT rights - a reference to the bitter disputes over gender recognition and transgender rights, which Swinney's advisers believe have lost them centre-ground voters.\n\nThe Greens claim the former first minister Humza Yousaf's disastrous decision to scrap the Bute House agreement between the SNP and the Greens which precipitated his resignation, and Forbes's reemergence in government, has led SNP members to defect to the Greens.\n\nHarvie's fellow co-leader, Lorna Slater, told BBC Radio Scotland her party was experiencing a \"surge\" in membership, \"particularly people in the LGBTQ+ community [who] are now looking at the SNP and thinking: 'Oh my goodness, is this really the home for me?'\"\n\nAlyn Smith, an SNP MP who has championed gay equality within his party, defended the principle of Forbes's appointment. \"Scotland's a big tent but we're too small a community to exclude people, and people of faith should have a role in politics,\" he told the same programme.\n\nForbes's position on equality issues was \"a matter for her to work through her conscience\", he said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Wednesday, after being confirmed by a vote of MSPs on Tuesday.\n\nSwinney will lead a minority SNP government and familiar faces from the party, including likely future leadership contenders such as Kate Forbes and Mairi McAllan, were seen entering Bute House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nForbes will take economy portfolio and responsibility for Gaelic, as well as the Deputy First Minister

address the pressing issues facing the people of Scotland.\n\n\"With that in mind, I have selected a Cabinet team that blends experience and energy, with a strong focus on the priorities my Government will pursue - eradicating child poverty, driving economic growth, meeting climate obligations and investing in our vital public services.\"\n\nHe added: \"I believe that Scotland's future is best served as an independent country - but I recognise more people need to be convinced of that before independence can be achieved.\n\n\"My Cabinet will also focus efforts on reaching out to those who remain unconvinced, with respect and courtesy, to ensure that the people of Scotland have the democratic right to choose their own future.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said Swinney's Cabinet was \"simply Humza Yousaf's Cabinet with a different figurehead\".\n\nScots Tory MSP and party chair Craig Hoy went on: \"The return of Kate Forbes is a desperate attempt by both John Swinney and his new

That's sometimes difficult, as Humza Yousaf found following Nicola Sturgeon.\"\n\nBut Mr Wishart, who has been an MP since 2001, reckons Mr Swinney is now perfect for the role.\n\nHe said: \"I've seen the development of somebody who's grown in stature. He knows how to make things work.\n\n\"He's been there through the good and bad times. He is now the finished product. There is no one better equipped to lead our country.\"\n\nJack McConnell takes it back to school\n\nOne man who quite literally had a front row seat for Mr Swinney's leadership was former Labour First Minister Jack McConnell.\n\nHe squared off against his SNP rival every Thursday in Holyrood.\n\nMr McConnell, a maths teacher before he entered politics, reckons Mr Swinney's key focus in the top job needs to be on improving public services - particularly education.\n\nHe said: \"Improving the education service should be the number one priority, and I hope he makes a better job of that now than he did during the pandemic.\"\n\nMr Swinney's position as education secretary came under threat in 2020 during an exams marking scandal.\n\nPupils from poorer backgrounds had their predicted results downgraded because of blanket rules applied to historical results while they were unable to sit formal tests due to Covid.\n\nLabour insiders appear relaxed about the prospect of current leader Anas Sarwar facing off against the new SNP leader each week.\n\nDavid McLetchie was 'tougher'\n\nOne Labour insider told us Lord McConnell actually feared taking on Tory leader David McLetchie much more than Mr Swinney at the time.\n\nThey said: \"David McLetchie was a much tougher opponent for Jack than John Swinney.\n\n\"He was sharper, more charismatic, and Jack would go into debates with the two worried only about David.\"\n\n\"He was incredibly weak,\" said veteran Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who was serving as an MSP under Lord McConnell at the time. \"I do think this feels like back to the future.\"\n\nShe added: \"In education, his mission was to close the attainment gap. He's not done that. He made such a disaster of the SQA exams.\"\n\nThe SNP dissenter\n\nDisunity within the SNP ranks was rife during Mr Swinney's first tenure in charge - an all too familiar problem for the party over the past year.\n\nVeteran nationalist Margo MacDonald was expelled from the party in 2003 and would be returned to Holyrood later that year as an independent.\n\nGlasgow MSP Dorothy-Grace Elder quit the SNP a year earlier, and remains scathing about Mr Swinney's time as leader.\n\nShe told us his election as first minister was \"bad news\" for the independence movement.\n\nThe former MSP, who left Holyrood in 2003, said: \"Not all have past experience of Swinney's disastrous time as party leader, the loss of seats, and credibility.\n\n\"I left because of the bullying, dirty tricks, and time waste of his regime - so different from his superficial image. He runs rather than solves anything.\"\n\nThe expert\n\nJames Mitchell, professor of public policy at Edinburgh University, said Mr Swinney has typically been a \"company man\" who's shown loyalty to his party above all else.\n\n\"He was dealt a difficult hand, though nowhere near as difficult as now,\" he told us.\n\n\"He wasn't a leader, was buffeted by events, and lacked strategy.\"\n\nProf Mitchell, who was Strathclyde University's chair in politics at the time, said there is a risk Mr Swinney will make the same mistakes as before.\n\nHe said: \"He's had a lot of experience, but what has he learned?\"\n\nHe also reckons Mr Swinney needs to make some big changes to the SNP's backroom team if he is to succeed.\n\n\"If he is serious and wants to show leadership he'd do a big clearout,\" Prof Mitchell said.\n\nHe added: \"He needs to replace most special advisers and bring in policy experts.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nVIDEO: John Swinney praises wife's support through MS to help

in office.\n\nMr Yousaf had earlier urged Nats members to \"get right behind\" his successor, John Swinney.\n\nHe said: \"Being the First Minister of the country I love, the country I am raising my family in, and the only country I will ever call home has been a phenomenal honour.\n\n\"As a young Muslim boy, born and raised in Scotland, I could never have dreamt that one day I would have the privilege of leading my country - people who looked like me, were not in positions of political influence, let alone leading governments when I was younger.\n\n\"I am proud to have delivered a council tax freeze for households in every local authority in Scotland, invested record amounts in our National Health Service, removed peak fares on our railways, and approved plans for Europe's largest floating offshore wind farm.\n\n\"And through our actions, an estimated 100,000 children are expected to be kept out of poverty this year.\n\n\"From the backbenches of the Scottish Parliament, I will continue to champion the rights and the voices of those who are often not heard, be they at home or abroad.\"\n\nMr Yousaf's resignation letter to King Charles read: \"Your Majesty, With my humble duty, I write as anticipated in my letter to Your Majesty of 29 April to tender to Your Majesty my resignation from the office of First Minister.\n\n\"I propose that my resignation take effect from the start of Scottish parliamentary plenary business on Tuesday 7 May 2024.\n\n\"Throughout my time as First Minister, I have been most grateful for your counsel and the kindness you have shown to both Nadia and I.\n\n\"It has been my pleasure to serve Your Majesty and the people of Scotland since March 2023.\"\n\nIt comes as Mr Swinney was crowned as the SNP's new leader after it was confirmed he would not be opposed in his bid to succeed Mr Yousaf.\n\nThe veteran Nat staved off a late attempt by a party activist to challenge him for the position, avoiding the prospect of a leadership contest.\n\nAs leader of the largest party at Holyrood, Mr Swinney is now set to be voted in by MSPs on Tuesday before officially being sworn in as First Minister at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.\n\nIt should mean that Mr Swinney is in place to face his inaugural First Minister's Questions session at the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.\n\nIt is the second time the MSP for Perthshire North has been SNP leader, having led the party between 2000 and 2004.\n\nFollowing his confirmation, Mr Swinney said: \"I am deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP.\n\n\"I will give all that I have to serve my party and my country.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

An outspoken and bitter personal attack on the views of Swinney's new deputy, Kate Forbes, by the Scottish Greens, saw to that.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"new politics\", there's only politics, and it will always be a bear garden because, well, that's how things develop in an adversarial system such as ours. The new First Minister reckoned he might be able to con us by promising to be a different sort of leader - you know, one who is polite to his opponents and nice enough to do deals with them.\n\nBut there was never a cat in hell's chance of anything like that happening, and there never will be, for as long as there are seven Scottish Greens sitting in the Holyrood chamber.\n\nThey are not in the slightest bit interested in playing any kind of cosy palsy-walsy partners with anyone else. All they want is to maintain the table-thumping anger that forced Humza Yousaf to chuck them out of the coalition they'd enjoyed with the SNP for the previous three years.\n\nAnd that means that they will insist on continuing to get their way on every issue that they, and they alone, care about - albeit from the back benches now that they're excluded from government.\n\nThey signalled how they plan to proceed earlier this week by being the only party among the five in Holyrood who refused to agree to the Scottish Government adopting a positive approach to the Cass reforms, which called for children who think they may be transgender not to be rushed into treatment they may regret.\n\nScotland's 'killer road'\n\nThen at Question Time, Fergus Ewing, the veteran former SNP minister, asked Swinney if he'd meet a cross-party delegation from every other Scottish party, except the Greens, to make sure that essential work to \"dual\" Scotland's \"killer road\" - the A9 between Perth and Inverness - was not further delayed. He said there had been another fatality this week.\n\nThe Scottish Greens have been frequently accused of opposing improvements to Scotland's trunk roads as part of their agenda to limit road traffic.\n\nHowever, easily the most obvious indication of the hard road which Swinney will now be forced to travel came from Patrick Harvie, one of the Scottish Greens co-leaders. He said - demanded would be a better description - that Swinney should not give in to his party's Right wing after sacking \"progressive ministers\", meaning himself and his co-leader, Lorna Slater.\n\nThen, getting into his stride against Kate Forbes, Harvie complained Swinney had given the second-most powerful job in Government \"to someone who has opposed LGBT people's legal equality ... expressed judgemental attitudes to abortion, and ... even expressed the view that people who have families without being married are doing something wrong\".\n\nThen for good measure he added that Swinney did not understand \"just how worried many LGBT people and others are in Scotland at the moment\". Really?\n\nBarbs won't bother Forbes\n\nAs an attack on a political opponent's personal beliefs Harvie's words were as vicious as I've ever heard but I'm sure it won't be the last from that quarter.\n\nI'm pretty sure that the new Deputy First Minister won't let Harvie's barbs bother her overmuch and Swinney did do the decent thing and insisted that Forbes had instituted progressive taxation - i.e. with the rich paying more.\n\nBut when Douglas Lumsden of the Tories described the Scottish Greens as \"extremists\" he was treated to a wee lecture from the First Minister about how politicians shouldn't use such terms about each other.\n\nWhy not? As far as I'm aware it's not one of those banned \"unparliamentary\" expressions and the Holyrood presiding officer, Alison Johnstone, who had been a Green MSP, didn't seem to bat an eyelid at its use.\n\nAnd anyway, has John Swinney got a better description for his former coalition allies?", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

The Liberal Democrats abstained, giving Swinney a narrow majority because some opposition MSPs were absent.\n\nThe row over Forbes's conservative evangelical beliefs, based on Free Church of Scotland teachings, erupted at first minister's questions. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens' co-leader, said her appointment signalled a return \"to the repressive values of the 1950s\".\n\nSwinney rejected Harvie's criticisms. He said Forbes had presided over progressive tax changes and the introduction of the Scottish child payment while finance secretary. The first minister, who like Greer is a member of the Church of Scotland, said he took Harvie's challenges \"very seriously\".\n\n\"When I say that I want to be the first minister for everyone in Scotland, I deeply mean that,\" Swinney added. \"I want to lead a modern, dynamic and diverse Scotland, a place for everybody. Where everybody feels at home, at peace, that they have a place and that their place in our society is protected by my leadership of this country.\"\n\nGreer dismissed those reassurances. He said that he, Forbes and Swinney all believed in Christ, and that he knew Swinney \"shares in the joy\" that LGBT people felt about Scotland's equal marriage reforms.\n\n\"Faith is not the issue here,\" he added. \"The issue is that I am being asked to vote for someone who thinks there is something wrong with me, not because of any views I hold but simply because of who I am.\n\n\"Yesterday Kate Forbes was given the opportunity to reassure LGBT people in a question asked by ITV News. She did not. The first minister had to step in just to say the word LGBT.\"\n\nGreer added that over the last few years it felt as if Scotland \"was going backwards\" on LGBT rights - a reference to the bitter disputes over gender recognition and transgender rights, which Swinney's advisers believe have lost them centre-ground voters.\n\nThe Greens claim the former first minister Humza Yousaf's disastrous decision to scrap the Bute House agreement between the SNP and the Greens which precipitated his resignation, and Forbes's reemergence in government, has led SNP members to defect to the Greens.\n\nHarvie's fellow co-leader, Lorna Slater, told BBC Radio Scotland her party was experiencing a \"surge\" in membership, \"particularly people in the LGBTQ+ community [who] are now looking at the SNP and thinking: 'Oh my goodness, is this really the home for me?'\"\n\nAlyn Smith, an SNP MP who has championed gay equalities within his party, defended the principle of Forbes's appointment. \"Scotland's a big tent but we're too small a community to exclude people, and people of faith should have a role in politics,\" he told the same programme.\n\nForbes's position on equalities issues was \"a matter for her to work through her conscience\", he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I promise that that will all stop. I have changed.\"\n\nTo laughter across the chamber, he added: \"Perhaps time will tell on that one.\"\n\nHe harked back to the good times that showed a more consensual approach did work and did deliver results that could improve the lives of the people who live in Scotland.\n\n\"This is not the collaborative place that it has been in the past - a collaborative place that has done so much good to improve the lives of people in Scotland,\" he told MSPs.\n\nLive Blog | John Swinney sworn in as First Minister and names cabinet\n\n\"As the Parliament marks its 25-year anniversary and as one of the relatively small group of members who have been here from the start, I reflect on the major developments that have taken place through collaborative work and agreement over that time: for example, the ban on smoking in public places, which was taken forward by the Labour and Liberal Executive; minimum unit pricing, by the SNP Government; and the introduction of free bus travel for the under-22s, by the SNP-Green partnership. I commit my Government to working to create such agreement across the chamber. I hope that there is space and willingness for that to happen, in the interests of the people who sent us here.\"\n\nAfter finishing his speech, and in a grand gesture of good will, Scotland's seventh First Minister then walked around the chamber to shake hands with the leaders of the main opposition parties.\n\nHe went first to Douglas Ross, as the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, the largest opposition party, and then in turn Labour's Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Greens' co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, then the Lib Dems Alex Cole-Hamilton. He later thanked Ash Regan after the Alba MSP voted for him to become First Minister.\n\nIt was quite a change from the years of barracking and heckling opposition party MSPs, as Mr Swinney indeed conceded.\n\nSo why the sudden change?\n\nOn one reading it could well be that Mr Swinney is determined to turn over a new leaf and try and build a less toxic political discourse in Scotland simply for its own sake.\n\nWhile barracking and heckling may go down well with fervent supporters among all political parties, to most members of the public it's deeply unappealing macho behaviour. So Mr Swinney's new approach is a welcome attempt to create an improved political culture.\n\nUnspun | Who has more of a chance in Scotland: Nigel Farage or Count Binface?\n\nIt also makes him look like a better class of politician, someone who has set his sights on overcoming the bitter divides and strives to be First Minister for \"all of Scotland\".\n\nBut there is also a second need for greater collaboration - and that is one of real politik.\n\nHaving ditched the Greens the new First Minister will be governing as a minority SNP administration and will need the support of MSPs from other parties to get his budget and other legislation through parliament.\n\nFor their part the Greens have already set out their terms for continuing to support the government on key votes.\n\nEssentially this came down to whether the new FM would move forward with a \"water tight ban on conversion therapy\", the introduction of rent controls, and existing commitments to decarbonise home heating systems (ie the removal of gas boilers in favour of green energy heating systems such as heat pumps).\n\nHowever, while Mr Swinney has yet to set out his new policy platform in detail he's made clear he wants to focus on more bread and butter issues - growing the economy (which means creating a more business friendly environment), delivering public services and combating child poverty.\n\nWhile close to the hearts of Greens members, issues like a ban on conversion therapy, rent controls and replacing gas boilers with heat pumps (housebuilders and other business groups are campaigning against the latter two), would not be regarded by most as the pressing priorities for most voters.\n\nAnd while not seen as key bread and butter priorities, they are also the sort of issues that can lead to a great deal of unwelcome negative headlines.\n\nAny such a change of direction by Mr Swinney will of course be attacked by Green MSPs who will argue that the new First Minister Swinney has given up on progressive values and given into the SNP's 'right wing'.\n\nIt's also potentially a tricky matter internally for the SNP with some in his own party at Holyrood still close to the Greens and highly supportive of some of the policies such as on gender issues set out in the Bute House Agreement.\n\nSo without the continued support from the Greens Mr Swinney needs to reach out across the chamber and make new allies among the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and even Alba.\n\nHow Mr Swinney strives to deliver his more consensual approach and how the opposition parties decide to respond remains to be seen.\n\nGiven the proximity of a general election - expected later this year - and a Holyrood election in two years - when politicians tend to become more partisan

In key seats right across Scotland, we will be urging voters to send Swinney and the SNP a message at the General Election and take the next step of booting out this rotten SNP Government for good.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glasgow Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Times", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Education in Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross_(Scottish_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Ross (Scottish politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/resources/images/16901459/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

His few media appearances involved unveiling a series of civil service papers on separation, which made little public impact.\n\nNationalists were unhappy at the move to scrap the role, however, and Alex Salmond's Alba Party has accused Mr Swinney of making \"the decision to deprioritise independence in order to try broaden support\" in Holyrood for his minority government.\n\n'Obsession with independence must go'\n\nChris McEleny, the party's general secretary, said: \"Instead of appealing to Unionists, the First Minister should be reaching out to Alba Party's Holyrood leader Ash Regan MSP to turbo charge efforts to drive forward the case for independence.\"\n\nAlyn Smith, the SNP MSP for Stirling, said that having Mr Hepburn as independence minister had been \"really effective to focus Government on getting the independence white papers out of the door\".\n\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland: \"There has been a series of them, which I think need a much wider audience and a greater attention.\" Mr Smith said the role's responsibilities would be taken on by Angus Robertson, the Constitution Secretary.\n\nCraig Hoy, the Scottish Tory chairman, said: \"While it's welcome that this divisive and wasteful post has been axed, the SNP Government's obsession with independence needs to go with it - and we know that will never happen.\n\n\"John Swinney has doubled down on the SNP's separation fixation, as his campaign slogan - uniting for independence - illustrates.\"\n\nWillie Rennie, the former Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, welcomed Mr Hepburn, who is the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth MSP, being given a different job.\n\nHe said: \"For months I have been campaigning to free the Cumbernauld One from the drudgery of producing independence paper after independence paper that no one reads.

And time is of the essence.\n\nLabour fell from power in 2007 because it lost its change credentials.\n\nThe party looked entitled and sluggish - unwilling to tackle stuck problems or problematic structures and not nearly bold enough to create a progressive, modern, and confident Scotland.\n\nPolling suggests some voters feel the same about the SNP - including some independence supporters. How can the SNP avoid Labour's fate?\n\nREAD MORE: Scotland's first ever Cabinet Secretary for Gaelic welcomed\n\nWell, they must avoid the temptation to do glitzy window-dressing and devise an agenda that's bold, progressive ... and surprising.\n\nThere needs to be sense, argument, direction and a well-communicated bold strategy. Of course.\n\nBut there also has to be surprise that a minority government will dare to tackle thorny issues other governments - every other Scottish government in 25 years - has left behind.\n\nThis will be difficult for Swinney.\n\nBut despite the media clamour for \"safe\" economic policies and a \"temporary\" (aye right) pausing of the case for independence - choosing safety would be a colossal mistake.\n\nLet's take indy first. The state of the movement in 2024 reminds me of 2017 when Sturgeon decided to \"take independence off the table\" at the Scottish Parliamentary elections and totally scunnered SNP members.\n\nI remember hearing reports of \"indy-free\" leaflets arriving from HQ and being binned by angry activists.\n\nWe can't go back to a slightly embarrassed mention of indy as an afterthought, especially not after Humza Yousaf's \"first activist\" pledge and his assertion that the first line of the SNP manifesto would state that a \"vote for the SNP is a vote for independence\".\n\nThat's the very minimum needed to keep jaded Yessers on board.\n\nAgreed, it's not too clear where else independence supporters can take their votes, with the Greens bringing down an SNP first minister and Alba's Ash Regan joining forces with Unionist parties in a vote of no confidence against his government. But Swinney can't take Yes support for granted.\n\nThere's still the 2017 danger that disillusioned activists just stay at home. What might encourage everyone is a serious platform of long overdue change.\n\nBold progressive measures that surprise critics, seize the agenda (much as Alex Salmond did back in the day) reassure those who doubt Swinney's energy, call the bluff of opposition parties who've long complained about broken systems without producing workable alternatives, and use the Scottish Government's newly acquired internal stability to do what previous leaders could/would not.\n\nAnd that means listening to folk beyond the Holyrood opposition parties and the all-powerful consultant class.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't KPMG that proposed the Scottish Child Payment (SCP), which has become the SNP's most cited and effective change credential.\n\nA coalition of all the poverty charities in Scotland managed to reach and persuade Sturgeon. Last year Professor Danny Dorling said the SCP has made the biggest single change to child poverty anywhere in Europe over the last 40 years.\n\nAn impressive achievement that did NOT come from the SNP, accountants or the consultancy classes. Ditto minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which has produced a 13% reduction in alcohol-related deaths, according to The Lancet.\n\nThat policy was the brainchild of the late Evelyn Gillan, formerly director of Alcohol Focus and one of the few people able to penetrate the shield of minders around Sturgeon.\n\nJohn Swinney with his appointed Cabinet of Ministers\n\nThe move triggered attacks by the powerful alcohol lobby, prompting five years of legal battles at the Court of Session, the European Court of Justice, and the Supreme Court - all of which the Scottish Government won - against the expectations of most sage professionals.\n\nIt's time to do that again.\n\nRestore the SNP's change credentials and surprise everyone by getting off the back foot with long overdue reforms - like abolishing the Council Tax and replacing it (even partly) with a form of land tax.\n\nLike pausing the current ineffectual Land Reform Act and pushing ahead with a Succession Act so children can join the rest of humanity and equally inherit land or a Compulsory Sales Order that lets councils order the sale of derelict land without taking it onto their own books - long promised and very useful now.\n\nSimilarly, it's one thing to have the strongest inward investment track record in Britain, but it means our key economic assets from airports to hydro dams are mostly owned by foreign private companies.\n\nCommon Weal amongst others have a lot of ideas for growing our own small and medium-scale Scottish companies.\n\nWill Forbes take their thinking on board? Her decision not to stand clearly disappointed many, but though she is not in charge, she is in power.\n\nThere will be no policy debate thanks to Swinney's unopposed victory, so it's vital that the SNP organises a truly open autumn conference about ideas without silencing dissent, bypassing popular resolutions, or pricing volunteer indy groups out of attendance.\n\nSwinney has a lot of people to please and mouths to feed.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney",

At his time of appointment, he was the first Muslim leader of any Western nation.\n\nFollowing the First Minister's election in March last year, he announced his intention to stand down last week, remaining in post until a new First Minister was appointed.\n\nMr Yousaf officially tendered his resignation in writing today to His Majesty King Charles III which has been accepted and the Scottish Parliament notified.\n\nHumza Yousaf said:\n\n\"Being the First Minister of the country I love, the country I am raising my family in, and the only country I will ever call home has been a phenomenal honour.\n\n\"As a young Muslim boy, born and raised in Scotland, I could never have dreamt that one day I would have the privilege of leading my country - people who looked like me, were not in positions of political influence, let alone leading governments when I was younger.\n\n\"I am proud to have delivered a council tax freeze for households in every local authority in Scotland, invested record amounts in our National Health Service, removed peak fares on our railways, and approved plans for Europe's largest floating offshore windfarm. And through our actions, an estimated 100,000 children are expected to be kept out of poverty this year.\n\n\"From the backbenches of the Scottish Parliament, I will continue to champion the rights and the voices of those who are often not heard, be they at home or abroad.\"\n\nFirst Minister Humza Yousaf's letter to His Majesty King Charles III:\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nWith my humble duty, I write as anticipated in my letter to Your Majesty of 29 April to tender to Your Majesty my resignation from the office of First Minister. I propose that my resignation take effect from the start of Scottish parliamentary plenary business on Tuesday 7 May 2024.\n\nThroughout my time as First Minister, I have been most grateful for your counsel and the kindness you have shown to both Nadia and I.\n\nIt has been my pleasure to serve Your Majesty and the people of Scotland since March 2023.\n\nHumza Yousaf\n\nParliament votes for John Swinney.\n\nJohn Swinney has been nominated as the seventh First Minister of Scotland, following a vote in the Scottish Parliament today.\n\nMSPs voted 64 to 57 to select Mr Swinney as First Minister from a total of four nominees. There were seven abstentions.\n\nMr Swinney is anticipated to be formally appointed as First Minister this afternoon with a Royal Warrant from His Majesty King Charles III. He will be officially sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday, where he will take the Official Oath in front of the Lord President of the Court of Session and other senior judges.\n\nFirst Minister-designate John Swinney said:\n\n\"It is an extraordinary privilege and it is my honour to accept the office of First Minister, committing myself to do the best I can for Scotland.\n\n\"I will be unapologetic about bringing to this Parliament the measures we can take to eradicate child poverty and I look forward to seeking the support of others to achieve that aim. I recognise, that is how it is going to have to work. I am leading a minority Government. I will need to reach out to others to make things happen. If we want to fund our schools and our hospitals, if we want to give our businesses a competitive edge, if we want to take climate action, if we want to eradicate child poverty, if we want to change people's lives for the better, we have to work together to do so.\n\n\"I commit my Government to working to create that agreement across the Chamber. I hope there is the space and the willingness for that to happen in the interests of the people who sent us here.\n\n\"To the people of Scotland I would simply say this.

He added: \"We will set out our commitments as we take Budget decisions.\n\nPushed for a Yes/No answer by Mr Ross, the First Minister said: \"I've nothing really to add to Douglas Ross about the financial position we face.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Ross accused Mr Swinney of \"not being straight with the public\".\n\nThe Scottish Government has come under fire over the past year for racking up a \u00a31.5 billion budget hole due to pledges it can't afford. The UK Government has insisted it is delivering increases in day-to-day spending for the Scottish Government, which also has tax raising powers.\n\nThe exchanges came hours after Mr Swinney was warned by the Scottish Greens that they may not support him to pass laws.\n\nIt comes just a fortnight after Mr Yousaf's decision to axe the power-sharing Greens sparked a furious backlash from the hardline left-wing party, which said it would vote for a Tory-led motion to get rid of Mr Yousaf - triggering his downfall and eventual resignation.\n\nBut Mr Swinney faces a similar problem of not having a parly majority - and needing either the Greens or another opposition party's support to pass laws.\n\nToday, Ms Slater said Mr Swinney had not reached out to her party since officially becoming First Minister earlier this week.\n\nAnd she said the Nats would need to \"find another party\" to work with on every Bill and Budget.\n\nThe Greens MSP said: \"As a minority government, this government is going to have to find another party to work with on every Bill, every piece of legislation, every Budget, on a case by case basis.\"\n\nMs Slater also suggested those elected to Holyrood should not be \"shouting insults across the chamber\".\n\nShe said: \"They are going to have to chase unionist votes if they want to get things through that the Scottish Greens don't support.\n\n\"This is how a functional parliament should work, especially one with proportional representation, it should be about grown-up politics where we work together on things that we share a common agenda on.\n\n\"It shouldn't be this awful Westminster politics where everybody is factionalised and shouting insults across the chamber and you'd never work with so and so, I mean I don't think anyone wants to see that

Local representatives are praising his \"vast experience\" and his immediate focus in his party leadership acceptance speech on addressing child poverty, and invited him onto the campaign trail for this year's general election.\n\nScottish Government minister Mairi McAllan, the Clydesdale MSP, offered her \"fullest congratulations\" and said: \"John Swinney takes up the role of leading our country not borne out of long-held ambition, but rather a profound sense of duty to the country and to the party.\n\n\"Our new First Minister is a unifier, and brings a renewed focus on the priorities of the people of Scotland - the economy, jobs, the cost of living, and the climate crisis.\n\n\"Today is the beginning of a new chapter in our party's history, that will be about coming together, uniting and dedicating ourselves again to the service of Scotland, and I look forward to playing my role alongside our new first minister in delivering for the people of Clydesdale and Scotland.\"\n\nClare Adamson, the Motherwell & Wishaw MSP, said: \"John Swinney commands respect across political divides. He is ideally equipped to serve as first minister, his commitment to the national interest is second to none.\n\n\"Voters put their faith in the SNP to stand up for Scotland and its people. John Swinney has spent his life and career doing just that and vast experience instils confidence. He is an invaluable asset to the SNP.\"\n\nShe added of his predecessor: \"Humza Yousaf's dedication to public service is beyond reproach. He served as first minister with integrity and compassion [and his] leadership at the onset of the crisis in Gaza - advocating for peace - is a mark of his character.\"\n\nRutherglen MSP Clare Haughey said the new First Minister \"brings with him great experience, dedication, and an ability to unite people to work together for the benefit of all\" and said: \"His focus is firmly on the economy, jobs, the cost of living crisis, the NHS, the climate crisis, and public service.\n\n\"We have all been sent to parliament to make a real difference to people's lives, and John's pledge to reach out to everyone in good faith and seek common ground and compromises that will serve our nation well is very welcome.\"\n\nEast Kilbride constituency colleague Collette Stevenson agreed: \"He has a wealth of political knowledge and commands respect from across the Scottish Parliament.\n\n\"I believe our new First Minister will re-energise the party, working hard across the chamber to find consensus [and prioritising] economic growth, the NHS, public services and redoubling efforts to lift children out of poverty.\"\n\nChristina McKelvie, the Hamilton, Larkhall & Stonehouse MSP, said she was \"delighted\" by Mr Swinney's election as First Minister, calling him \"an extremely experienced politician who will lead our country with passion and pride\".\n\nShe said: \"He has a proven track record and brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience. He will listen to other people's perspectives, governing for the whole of our country and I have no doubt he will deliver a better future for Scotland.\"\n\nFulton MacGregor, the Coatbridge & Chryston MSP, said: \"I'm delighted that John Swinney has stepped forward and been made leader of the SNP, and I'm excited about this new era under his leadership. John has the experience and ability to unify the party and govern the country in the best interests of everyone.\"\n\nConstituency colleague Steven Bonnar MP agreed: \"John Swinney is the right person at the right time to lead the SNP and become our new First Minister. It's been a difficult time for the party, but John has all the experience we could ask for at this time.\n\n\"Our shared goals are simple as we approach the general election - immediately helping those people who face an unrelenting cost of living crisis caused by Westminster, by delivering policy that can help change lives for all the people of Scotland.\"\n\nAngela Crawley, the Lanark and Hamilton East MP, congratulated the new First Minister and said: \"In his first speech as party leader, John made clear that he will focus on tackling the cost of living - something which I wholeheartedly support.\n\n\"He has a wealth of experience in government so I have no doubt that he will be up to the challenge and will work hard for the people of Scotland. I look forward to working with him over the coming months and wish him the very best for his tenure as First Minister.\"\n\nAnum Qaisar, the Airdrie & Shotts MP, added: \"Articulate, intelligent and always leading from the front, John has dedicated his working life to representing the people of Scotland.\n\n\"He is also a kind, just man who is determined to tackle the stain that is child poverty - an issue which is incredibly important to my Airdrie and Shotts constituents and I.\n\n\"I'll be extending an invite to John to join me on my local re-election campaign as he has a huge support here and thoroughly enjoyed campaigning at my by-election with me over in Shotts.\"\n\nMarion Fellows, the MP for Motherwell & Wishaw, welcomed Mr Swinney's unchallenged election as party leader, saying: \"It means there [was] no divisive contest similar to the one that saw SNP politician pitted against SNP politician just over a year ago.\"\n\nShe said: \"Already John is rallying MSPs, MPs and the wider party membership behind him - he has the added bonus that he has a high public profile and is seen as an honest and principled politician who will strive to work for the whole of Scotland.\n\n\"John also has the respect of politicians from other parties. He has my full support and I look forward to the progress we can all make for the people of Scotland.\"\n\nSpeaking at Holyrood following the new First Minister's election, Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: \"John Swinney must swiftly change course and deliver a bold new policy course for this government instead of treadng water.\n\n\"The First Minister and his party must treat today as a reset moment - with our education system at record lows in international rankings, one in seven Scots on an NHS waiting list, violent crime rising and our economy lagging behind the rest of the UK, Scotland faces significant challenges that demand the government's attention.\"\n\nLabour leader Anas Sarwar called the unopposed change of SNP leadership \"an internal stitch-up\" and said: \"At this time of national crisis, people need a government that's willing to lend a hand and support them not feel abandoned by this and the UK government.\n\n\"I hope we see a new approach that puts the national interest first. We need to get on to delivering for the people of Scotland. We share a common purpose to make Scotland the best place to grow up and grow old in.\"\n\n* Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire.

A change from the 1310s, Patrick", "body": "Is Graeme McCormick still available? The veteran SNP activist stood aside and let John Swinney become leader without a contest, but on the strength of the First Minister's first parliamentary outing, Mr McCormick was robbed.\n\nSwinney choked. It was his debut First Minister's Questions and he was at turns hesitant, rambling, underbriefed and trying too hard.\n\nWas it an unmitigated disaster? No, in the sense that he didn't set himself on fire or accidentally declare war on Norway, but it was bad.\n\nSitting to his right - no jokes, please - was Kate Forbes, reminiscent of the 'here's what you could have won' segment in old game shows.\n\nDouglas Ross raked over the embers of Swinney's time as education secretary, reminding him of his promise to raise teacher numbers by 3,500 by the end of this parliament.\n\nDeputy First Minister Kate Forbes listens as John Swinney attends his inaugural First Minister's Questions\n\nWould he be sticking to his word?\n\nBack came a halting reply about Westminster funding, but no answer.\n\n'The excuses are the same as we've had before,' Ross spat, before repeating the question.\n\n'I've just come back into office,' the First Minister protested.\n\n'I've not been on this front bench in 12 months.'\n\nHis mewling was pitiful. The bloke was effectively co-leader of Scotland for 16 of the past 17 years.\n\nHe didn't just walk in off the street, despite the impression his performance gave.\n\nRoss levelled his query a third time.\n\nBloodlessly, Swinney stated: 'I've nothing really to add to what I've said to Douglas Ross about the financial position we face.'\n\nAfter years spent cultivating the image of a provincial bank manager, he sounded like he was turning the Tory leader down for a fixed-term mortgage.\n\nThe evasiveness drew barracking from the Conservative benches, led by Craig Hoy, an MSP who speaks more often than he has something to say.\n\nRoss entered Jeremy Paxman territory by asking his teacher-numbers question a fourth time in a row, as Swinney grimaced silently.\n\n'I am going to be straight with the public of Scotland,' he announced. No doubt he'll start any day now.\n\nThings did not improve when Anas Sarwar stepped up, scolding the SNP for fixating on themselves and not the hundreds of teachers about to be made redundant by their colleagues at Glasgow City Council.\n\nEvents of the past two weeks had been 'frankly traumatic for my party', Swinney said. Being part of a mass lay-off is frankly pretty traumatic, too.\n\nThe First Minister refused to intervene, but acknowledged 'challenges', prompting Sarwar to remind the former finance and education secretary who created the 'challenges'.\n\nThe Labour chief urged for 'fresh leadership'.\n\n'I have good news for Anas Sarwar,' Swinney piped up. 'Fresh leadership has just arrived and I am here to deliver it.'\n\nA gale of laughter tore across the chamber, interspersed with applause on the Nationalist benches. Labour MSPs pointed out that some of those chuckling were SNP members.\n\n'They are laughing because they are delighted that I am here to do it,' Swinney protested.\n\n'That is why they are laughing. They are over the moon that I am here.'\n\nLord knows Humza Yousaf was hopeless but the SNP appears to have replaced Mr Bean with Alan Partridge.\n\nScottish Green Party Leader Patrick Harvie today at First Minister's Questions\n\nPatrick Harvie, the angriest little cabbage in all the land, seethed over the appointment of Kate Forbes and accused Swinney of 'taking us back to the repressive values of the 1950s'.\n\nIt makes a change from trying to take us back to the 1310s.\n\nSwinney objected that his government would be 'led from the moderate left-of-centre' and rhymed off the lefty policies Forbes had helped deliver.\n\nHarvie was unplacated.\n\nThe strongest turn of the day came from Labour firebrand Pauline McNeill, who demanded the Crown Office be held 'fully accountable' for wrongful Horizon convictions in Scotland 'because it did not provide the checks and balances that it should have'.\n\nShe wants to haul the Lord Advocate before the parliament.\n\nIt's a call Dorothy Bain, KC, can no longer refuse.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type":

Others, however, might have noted that within moments of being confirmed in Scotland's top job, he knowingly made three promises that he is all but guaranteed to break. Presumably he hopes that enough Scots will continue to prefer SNP rhetoric over the harsh reality of its continuing failures, scandals and missteps.\n\nSo when John Swinney says he is going to be First Minister for \"everyone\" it will have as much meaning as when his then boss Nicola Sturgeon said the same thing on taking on the top job. She then led Scotland into one of the most divisive periods in its history as she time and again favoured her supporters' dreams for separation over the general public's yearning for effective public services.\n\nEqually, as Mr Swinney claimed he will make eradicating child poverty his defining mission, some will have heard echoes of Ms Sturgeon's \"judge me on our record in education\" commitment, which proved to be utterly meaningless. Indeed, the many in Scotland on NHS waiting lists, or desperate for a ferry service that works, or troubled about the state of their children's education, might wonder how our new First Minister's focus on what sounds good rather than on the biggest challenges that they face will merely delay further any hope for them seeing real improvements.\n\nThen there is that \"more collaborative and respectful politics\" promise. It's presumably possible that by some quirk in nature a leopard changes its spots, but as the SNP's heckler in chief for so many years in Holyrood, it is no wonder that this promise from Mr Swinney was met with some disbelief by MSPs. At future FMQs can we look forward to our new First Minister honestly owning up to the part he and his party have played in all the problems Scotland now faces, or will he follow his predecessors' tactic of deflection and blaming of anyone and anything but SNP mismanagement?\n\nKeith Howell, West Linton.\n\n* I FULLY applaud John Swinney's speech as our new First Minister in promising to be a First Minister for all the people in Scotland. The cold reality however is that Mr Swinney has been one of the main architects of SNP policy for the last 20 years and has brought us to the terrible state that we are in with education and the worst-ever NHS services.\n\nHe wouldn't last five minutes as SNP leader if he started working for the majority of Scottish people who don't want independence.\n\nDennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen.\n\nREAD MORE: No Ross Greer, your policies aren't progressive: just stupid\n\nREAD MORE: SNP should have had its retread a decade ago. It's too late now\n\nREAD MORE: What would John Smith make of Anas Sarwar's actions?\n\nConsider the alternatives\n\nALISON Rowat rightly has a bit of fun with John Swinney and the SNP (\"'This is the new, and slightly more humble, face of the SNP'\", The Herald, May 8). She has no room, however, in her article for the alternatives.\n\nWe have Anas Sarwar and Douglas Ross, both LINOs (Leader in Name Only and there to be walked over) and both with long undistinguished careers in Westminster and Holyrood. Mr Sarwar was in the room when Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont realised her job title was a joke and quit: Mr Sarwar is aware of his status because he followed on from elected Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard whom Keir Starmer boasted he had sacked. Douglas Ross is no better, as it was reported his leadership was ultimately as a result of murky backroom dealings and he has tied his dinghy to the Ship of Fools, aka the British Conservative Party.\n\nI could mention the LibDems (a party I once voted for), but their politics are entirely based on their British nationalism rather than ideology: happy to be in coalition with Tories or Labour, but not any democratic pro-independence party.\n\nI DO not support independence and have no sympathy for the SNP in its current death by a thousand cuts, but others do, and their views are to be respected.\n\nWhat I find disappointing is that already, disproportionate attention has been focused on John Swinney's age and Kate Forbes' genuine religious beliefs as if this was some burden impeding their ability to do their respective jobs.\n\nWith Scotland in a parlous state distraction from the real issues should be minimised and we need to home in on the policies to be followed and on Mr Swinney's and Ms Forbes' ability to get us out of the mire.\n\nTHERE is a silence in the land. We are nearing May 12, the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish Parliament, but this event has been eclipsed by the chaos in the ruling party's leadership. There are vague plans to mark the occasion later in the year, with, for example, the Presiding Officer, Alison Johnstone (Green Party), touring the country to ask people's views about the parliament. But the occasion itself has scarcely been mentioned in public.\n\nBy contrast, in 2019, there were fanfares and a visit from Her Late Majesty to Holyrood, among other events, to celebrate Holyrood's 20th anniversary. But now there is little sign of celebration. As the journalist Chris Deerin rightly says, we now have \"an institution that is flawed, angry and divided. One that, for too many years, has arguably been focused on the wrong things.\" Legislation since 2019 has brought us the hate crime law and the Gender Reform Recognition Bill, two of the worst pieces of law-making in our history, as well as failed attempts by the SNP's Green allies to make our lives more miserable.\n\nIs there anything to celebrate? Holyrood is a lacklustre institution with mostly third-rate politicians, some of whom on the SNP benches are barely able to string a sentence together. It has all cost us billions of pounds, for everything from the building itself, through the inflated salaries - the first minister paid more than the UK's prime minister, for example - to subsidised canteens and superfluous ministers. Yes, Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Independence, I am looking at you.\n\nScottish nationalists think that Holyrood's failings derive from it not having full powers, but governments haven't used all the powers that they have. Why anyone thinks that a sovereign Scottish government would perform any better than what we have had recently is a mystery. Devolution in Scotland serves as an awful warning for anyone so much as thinking of leaving the UK.\n\nIS it any wonder that some contributors to the Letters Pages survey the UK economy and seek refuge in their fantasy of a newly independent Scotland cast adrift on a journey which makes Conor McCarthy's The Road resemble a day trip to Disneyland?\n\nDoes Alistair Easton (Letters, May 7) not appreciate that his confession that Brexit is a disaster, one of many heaped upon us by our neighbours, is not as he would have it a warning not to leave, but only confirms the sheer poverty of any argument to remain in the UK?\n\nThe present Westminster administration has proved itself incapable and indeed has only bankrupted its case.\n\nWill Keir Starmer, confronted by economic reality, be up to the task?\n\nNATALIE Elphicke, the MP for Dover, has defected from the Tories and has been welcomed into the Labour Party, making her the third such defection under Keir Starmer (\"Tory MP defects to Labour just minutes before PMQs\", heraldscotland, May 8). Like the other defectors, Ms Elphick appears to have had an epiphany and no longer wants to be associated with the party that she served so dutifully as an MP since 2019. Presumably she no longer supports the attacks on workers' rights, or the Rwanda legislation that she voted for, or the desperate poverty caused by the two-child benefit cap (oh, hold on: the Labour Party has refused to abolish it, so no issues on that one).\n\nConversely, whilst Tories who have been responsible for growing impoverishment, intolerance and corruption in the UK are welcome in the new-look parliamentary Labour Party there remains no room for people who have dedicated their lives to that party and to tackling injustice, inequality and racism.

The guy who played second fiddle for most of his career, finally got a shot at the big job, then fluffed it - with his Mr Grumble antics dragging him down.\n\nThere is a time and a place for being furious, of course.\n\nBut for Swinney, now is not that time.\n\nNot least when you've been going on about wanting to put an end to the politics of division and shouting at each other.\n\nThursday will be Swinney's inaugural First Minister's Questions as the FM himself, even if he's done a fair few of these sessions standing in for Sturgeon.\n\nLast week, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross - let's call him Mr Mischief - saw his chance in Holyrood amid the will-they-won't-they drama over Swinney and possible challenger Kate Forbes.\n\nRoss wound up the pair, mercilessly. Forbes reacted with a smile, albeit a sarcastic one.\n\nBut as Ross shoehorned in Swinney's nickname of \"Honest John\" followed by a \"no-so-honest\" barb, you could almost see the blood rushing to Swinney's head.\n\nHe snarled and shouted and jabbed his hand across the chamber. Hook, line and sinker for Mr Mischief.\n\nNext time, John, just fold your arms, sit back and smile.\n\nAnd at the event launching his campaign last week, Swinney seemed full of pent-up rage. It was an odd spectacle, given he was meant to be sounding a note of optimism.\n\nBut, old habits die hard. Swinney was Sturgeon's enforcer. He's notorious for his loud heckles at Holyrood, being ticked off time and again by the Presiding Officer.\n\nSo, on Monday, and indeed yesterday, it looked like the spin doctors had had a not so subtle word in the ear. Easy now, John. Be gracious.\n\nAll eyes are on you. Nobody likes a scowling grump - especially on day one.\n\nBack in 2007, there were attempts at an image makeover for ex Labour leader Brown, as aides tried to reinvent the crotchety penny-pincher as a polished statesman.\n\nThe mask slipped, of course, many times, including the infamous incident when he was picked up on mic calling a Labour-backing pensioner who'd challenged him over the economy and immigration a \"bigoted woman\".\n\nAnother car-crash episode during those times was Brown's alleged musical love, the Arctic Monkeys.\n\nThis spiralled out of control following an interview about acts he liked, and ended with Brown being unable to name a single track from the Sheffield band.\n\nWhich brings me to what's on John Swinney's AirPods or, more realistically, his 1980s hi-fi.\n\nLazy folk may assume Swinney has a handful of songs on repeat - say, I Want to Break Free, and Caledonia.\n\nPerhaps twice-SNP-leader Swinney is a fan of 1994 Stone Roses album Second Coming, albeit this may not bode well given a fair few critics considered it a flop.\n\nGiven his angry antics of the past few years, Swinney may actually prefer Marilyn Manson, or guttural screamers Slipknot to get warmed up for parly debates.\n\nThose aides around him are obviously acutely aware of this image issue.\n\nThe way Swinney began his SNP acceptance speech on Monday saw him speaking softly, deliberately, kindly - no snarling, no pointing.\n\nIt was similar yesterday at Holyrood, when idealistic soundbites about representing all Scots were the order of the day.\n\nAnyone would think he'd been humming along to Simon and Garfunkel to get himself into the zone.\n\nMore likely, aides had told him that some people have pointed out that Mr Angry does not have the best chances for taking on Anas Sarwar and his message of change and hope.\n\nLet's call the Scottish Labour leader Mr Bounce, given the polls - with the obligatory warning that what goes up, must come down.\n\nSwinney, though, should learn the lessons of recent political history.\n\nIf he slips back into furious mode too readily, people will be quick to sniff out that there's something not quite right with all of this.\n\nThey may suspect that Swinney is actually a reluctant participant in a quick-find-a-caretaker plot by SNP bosses.\n\nAnd with the General Election ahead - like Brown all those years ago - he may only be a stopgap leader ahead of a changing of the guard.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Will that progress continue, or will the First Minister give in to the right-wing of his party?\"\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney addresses ending 'minister for independence' role\n\nIn his response, Swinney said it was \"a matter of history and record that the Deputy First Minister was responsible for introducing progressive taxes in Scotland\".\n\nHe went on: \"Kate Forbes took those budget decisions, sought the agreement of the Cabinet, and they were put to Parliament.\n\n\"And I welcome the fact that our colleagues in the Green Party supported the measures that the government brought forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party\u2013Scottish_Greens_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party\u2013Scottish Greens agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18060866/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

She takes a Blairite approach to reform of the public services, believing that \"what matters is what works\". She is a champion of wealth creation and business innovation as a means of expanding the tax base, providing resources to fund public services, and tackling poverty.\n\nAnd Forbes is popular with the public - certainly more popular than she has been with the self-declared \"progressives\" in the SNP, who are understandably infuriated by her prominent new role.\n\nIn one fell swoop, therefore, Swinney has returned the SNP to what it used to be - a broad, umbrella movement for those who believe in Scottish independence but might disagree on other policy areas. Like The Monkees, they all have to live with each other in the same house. It is an amusing rebuke to the Scottish Greens, the SNP's erstwhile coalition partners who have repeatedly attacked Forbes as representing reactionary, right-wing forces. They richly deserve it - all the right people are booing - and the Deputy First Minister is a more complex and interesting thinker than her opponents seek to portray her as.\n\nThe appointment is also an embrace of competence. As finance secretary, Forbes was well-liked by her civil servants, and drove them hard. She was behind many of the government's most innovative economic policies, in areas such as technology and helping women entrepreneurs, and a careful steward of taxpayers' money. She is admired by business leaders. Her intelligence and intellectual curiosity usually leaves a positive mark on those she interacts with. Whitehall found her the most productive of its devolved interlocutors - she was, as one London civil servant put it to me, able to \"get to yes\" when it came to tricky, cross-parliament negotiations.\n\nIn the end, this is also about electoral performance and self-interest. The SNP has been sliding in the polls due to its seeming disconnection from the concerns of mainstream voters. It has pursued projects, from gender reform to the hate crime bill to the named person plan, that have left much of the electorate scratching its collective head. As school performance has declined and NHS waiting lists have grown, the Nat leadership has at times appeared wired to the moon.\n\nAs he appoints the rest of his cabinet, Swinney will no doubt seek a balance between SNP progressives and conservatives. This will be in some contrast to the Sturgeonite-heavy administration run by Humza Yousaf, which only delivered more of the same failing agenda that his predecessor had.\n\nThe handing of such an influential post to Forbes tells voters that the Scottish government intends to use the two years before the Holyrood election to focus on the big, important policy areas that make a difference to most voters' lives. Scottish Labour, which increasingly appeared as if it was on a glide path to Bute House, will be unnerved, and will have to respond.\n\nThere is no guarantee of success, of course. Swinney will still have to set out a practical agenda that delivers on the symbolism of his appointments. As the leader of a minority government, he will have to construct parliamentary majorities for his bills. And almost two decades into power, the SNP is weighted down by long years of policy error as well as electoral success. Many Scots are simply tired of the same old faces and want change.\n\nNevertheless, along with Swinney's measured early speeches about refocusing on a mainstream, centre-left approach, the appointment of Forbes sends a signal that this will not be a continuity administration. It might not be enough to avoid defeat. It certainly won't be enough to deliver independence. But it can unite most of a warring movement, and should give voters pause for thought.\n\nSmart deal-making, Mr Swinney. That's not nothing. In fact, it's quite promising.", "source": {"uri": "newstatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_deerin@newstatesman.com", "name": "Chris Deerin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blairism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blairism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reactionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2024/05/08/CardsTwitter-800x418.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Swinney, while responsible for a number of serious failures over the last seventeen years, is seen by voters as a serious man and a dutiful husband.\n\nForbes' social conservatism is a turn off for many voters, but she is viewed as a principled and capable politician.\n\nThe SNP under Yousaf was headed for general election catastrophe and a likely loss of Holyrood in 2026.\n\nThey have now stabilised and have an opportunity to remain the largest Scottish party at Westminster..\n\nAs pollster John Curtice said: \"Bringing Yousaf down was the worst thing the Unionists could have done. It's now a reset moment.\"\n\nScots Labour leader Anas Sarwar often says he has ensured his party is back on the pitch after years of irrelevance and squabbling.\n\nHe now has a match on his

That's why I will engage constructively with them, and with Cosla, when I meet with them on Friday.\"\n\nSarwar went on to accuse Swinney of having \"no answer for parents, pupils and teachers\".\n\nHe added: \"Let's look at John Swinney's record. as Finance Secretary, he broke local finances and slashed the budget for local services.\n\n\"As Education Secretary, he abandoned teachers, standards declined, the attainment gap widened, Scotland fell in the international league tables, and shamefully he downgraded the results of working class children during the pandemic.\n\n\"Now, as First Minister, he is trapped by the past defending his own record while Scotland's children pay the price.\n\n\"Scotland once had an education system that was the envy of the world - and I believe that we can get there again. But continuity won't cut it.\n\n\"To give our young people the education and opportunities they deserve, and to unlock the huge potential of our nation, Scotland needs fresh leadership, new ideas and change.\n\n\"So after being at the heart of every single SNP failure for the past 17 years, why does John Swinney think Scotland should accept more of the same?\"\n\nSwinney responded: \"I've got good news for Anas Sarwar. The fresh leadership has just arrived.\"\n\nAs opposition MSPs laughed and SNP members applauded, he added: \"I am right here to deliver it.\"\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click here", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mccall@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Chris McCall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_City_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow City Council"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government in Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister's_Questions_(Scottish_Parliament)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Record_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Record (Scotland)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32772684.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_01HXEP390ZE5XKJ5BXRSJ6G3R1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

'racist bigots' as he steps down as First Minister", "body": "He said it was an 'honour' to be the first person of colour to hold the top job\n\nHumza Yousaf has officially resigned as Scotland's First Minister ahead of a vote to elect his successor.\n\nDuring his last speech as FM to the Scottish Parliament, he told how leading his country had given him the opportunity to defy \"racist bigots\".\n\nYousaf became emotional as he said his heart would \"forever belong to Scotland\".\n\nThe Scottish Government said the King had accepted his letter of resignation on Tuesday morning and that the Scottish Parliament has been notified.\n\nYousaf was replaced as SNP leader by John Swinney on Monday with the MSP set to be voted through as FM on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nYousaf was tearful as he delivered his goodbye speech to MSPs, saying: \"I've had the greatest privilege of my life serving my country in government for almost 12 years, as minister for external affairs and international development, minister for transport, cabinet secretary for justice, cabinet secretary for health and social care and of course most recently as first minister.\n\n\"So my thanks must go to the people who gave me that opportunity by electing me to this place, the good people of Glasgow in 2011 and the fine people of Glasgow Pollok since 2016 who have continued to put their trust in me to stand up for them and to serve them.\n\n\"And also to my predecessors as first minister for giving this boy opportunities he could only have imagined in his wildest dreams.\n\n\"I'm grateful for the trust that you put in me over the years, because you see presiding officer a young Humza Yousaf could never have imagined that he would be able to lead this country.\n\n\"I was six years old when I was first told to go home, and I'm afraid since then it has been a regular occurrence, in fact almost daily if you look at my social media feeds and I won't lie presiding officer, it is that racial slur that probably hurts me the most.\"\n\nThe former SNP leader announced his intention to quit last week following a bitter falling out with his Scottish Greens colleagues in government.\n\nHe had ended the Bute House Agreement with the party and sacked its two leaders from the Cabinet ahead of a vote by Green members that could have ended the deal.\n\nCo-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater reacted furiously to the shock news and pledged to move against the now-former first minister in a vote of no-confidence.\n\nDuring his resignation speech last Monday, he said it had been an \"honour\" to serve as Scotand's first person of colour to hold the role of first minister.\n\nYousaf said he \"could never have dreamt that one day I would have the privilege of leading my country\", noting that as a boy, people of minority ethnicities were not seen in senior governmental roles.\n\nHe served in Bute House for 13 months after winning the SNP leadership election that was sparked by the resignation of his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nHis premiership got off to a rocky start after Police Scotland's long-running investigation into the SNP's funding and finances began making its first arrests.\n\nJust weeks after being voted through as FM, the force arrested Peter Murrell - Sturgeon's husband - with that being followed by the arrests of former party treasurer Colin Beattie and Sturgeon.\n\nAll were released pending further investigation at that point but last month officers charged Murrell with embezzlement of SNP funds.\n\nDuring Yousaf's time in office, he announced a nationwide council tax freeze, a trial on scrapping peak rail fares and effectively increased taxes on middle and higher earners.\n\nCritics of Yousaf have pointed to the failed deposit return scheme, slipping education scores in international tests and NHS waiting times during his tenure.\n\nHe also announced the SNP's independence strategy, which would see the Scottish Government try to begin negotiations with the UK Government to leave the union if the SNP won the majority of Westminster seats at the next election.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV

Indeed, one such critic was Mr Swinney.\n\nLast week the North Perthshire MSP told The Herald \"Kate and I are over that,\" when he was reminded of his remarks.\n\nBut while there may be some grumbles among those in the SNP who had forged close allegiances with the Greens during the Bute House Agreement years, among most there is likely to be a sense of relief that ongoing rows inside the party may be coming to an end.\n\nAs well as hoping that Ms Forbes' appointment will mean the drawing of a line under SNP divisions, Mr Swinney's decision to hand make her his number two, also suggests his government will have a new focus on the economy.\n\nSince launching his leadership bid last Thursday the First Minister has stressed that his focus will be on creating jobs, delivering crucial public services and combating child poverty.\n\nMs Forbes said his vision chimed with her own as she ruled out standing in the contest.\n\nTogether the new FM and DFM will be moving the Scottish Government back towards the mainstream of Scottish politics\n\nMs Forbes' appointment is already being enthusiastically welcomed by business organisations.\n\nBut notably the change of direction towards the centre ground is also move away from some of the core issues for the Scottish Greens which have to say the least been challenging for the SNP.\n\nWhile close to the hearts of Greens, a ban on conversion therapy, rent controls and replacing gas boilers with heat pumps (housebuilders and other business groups are campaigning against the latter two), would not be regarded by most as the pressing priorities for a majority of voters and had the habit of attracting unwelcome negative headlines for Mr Yousaf's government.\n\nMs Forbes's appointment was quickly seized on by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie - who was quick to underline the significant difference from the previous Cabinet.\n\nIn a statement released after she was unveiled as DFM, Mr Harvie said: \"There will be many people across our country who will be very concerned and who will want to know that this Scottish Government remains committed to a greener and more equal future for Scotland.\n\n\"When it comes to delivering fairer and more progressive taxation, a just transition from oil and gas and a watertight ban on so-called conversion therapy, it is vital that this government does not dilute the longstanding commitments that it has made.\"\n\nWhile the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems have decried the new Cabinet - which does indeed include all the same members as before along with the addition of Ms Forbes - as the 'same old, same old', in truth the government of Swinney and Forbes will be a very different one to that of Yousaf and Robison - and one likely to be a harder challenge for the Conservatives and Labour to take to task.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As Mr Salmond's finance chief, he was viewed as a calm, able figure who had a firm hand on the country's balance sheet.\n\nBut it's his relationship with Ms Sturgeon that may matter most in his first weeks and months as a resident of Bute House.\n\nSeveral documentaries, more than one book and thousands of column inches have been dedicated to examining Mr Salmond's relationship with Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nBut underexamined is her close bond with John Swinney, who was her most trusted lieutenant during her nine years as first minister.\n\nNicola Sturgeon: No one prouder to see John Swinney become first minister\n\nSources say the duo were inseparable. Of all the ministers and cabinet secretaries Ms Sturgeon appointed, it was the Perthshire North MSP she relied on most.\n\nIn congratulating him, Ms Sturgeon said that apart from his family, there would be no one prouder than her as he became First Minister.\n\nShe wrote: \"I have worked closely with John Swinney for more than 30 years. He was by my side throughout my time as FM - as deputy, friend and confidante.\n\n\"He is one of the kindest and most decent people I know - and without doubt the right person to be FM in this moment, for both party and country.\"\n\nHis role during Ms Sturgeon's time as first minister is not well known, precisely because of the way he approached it publicly.\n\nBut one insider told me: \"They spoke most days, probably even every day when it was very busy.\n\n\"I don't think Nicola has said this but the impression was that during Covid, when John worked at home more often and she was working in Edinburgh, she did miss him being there physically during some of the really tough decisions.\"\n\nMr Swinney's reputation from his time as deputy first minister is as the \"details\" man, he was able to navigate both the complex machinery of government and understood the political reality in parliament.\n\nOne Holyrood insider compared Mr Swinney, perhaps unfavourably, to the late Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n'He never tried to outshine Nicola Sturgeon'\n\nThey said: \"He knew his place and never tried to outshine Nicola. That was surprising to some people it's what politicians do when they are secretly eyeing up the job for themselves.\"\n\nWhile this dutiful approach to government and public service speaks well of Mr Swinney as a man, the qualities he will require as first minister are very different.\n\nHe will quickly have to step out of his predecessor's shadow, particularly as she deals with the personal scandal of her husband being charged as part of a police probe into the SNP's finance.\n\nBut politically, Mr Swinney, who has no personal first ministerial mandate from voters, will have to define his style if his time as leader is not to be curtailed at the ballot box.\n\nHe has already made tackling child poverty a clear priority, and has spoken earnestly about the importance he places on the love and support of his family.\n\nHis challenge is not an easy one. During Humza Yousaf's time at the top, he struggled to put clear blue water between himself and Ms Sturgeon, particularly as anger grew about the her government's secrecy with the Covid-19 Inquiry.\n\nMany assumed he was simply too afraid to criticise his former boss.\n\nMore importantly, Mr Yousaf also struggled to speak to voters. He never convinced them he had a plan to use government to make their lives better, too often writing off very real problems as \"Westminster's fault\", and was in denial about the deep divisions inside his own party.\n\nIf Mr Swinney is to be more than a caretaker overseeing the SNP's decline, he will be studying Mr Yousaf's 12 months in office very closely.\n\nAfter 17 years of SNP dominance, he will have to demonstrate he's a man with new ideas who is unafraid of confronting the failures of the past - even if he played a central role in the government's responsible.\n\nOtherwise, voters may opt for a fresh face.", "source": {"uri": "thecourier.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary for Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Salmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Salmond_government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Salmond government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A9_road_(Scotland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A9 road (Scotland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Carlaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Carlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverness"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inverness"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth, Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth, Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire_North_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perthshire North (Scottish Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/52761896470_050d32d16d_k-1-1guoea2k7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Members clearly wanted to bring some calm to a party riven with splits over independence strategy and policy priorities.\n\nThen, shortly after Mr Swinney was sworn in as Scotland's seventh first minister on Wednesday, it was announced that he has selected Kate Forbes to be his second-in-command. This is a recognition that Scotland is a far more 'small c' conservative nation than the priorities of recent SNP governments might suggest.\n\nWhen Nicola Sturgeon stepped down as her party's leader last year (prompting Swinney's resignation as deputy first minister), Forbes was, along with Ash Regan and Humza Yousaf, one of three candidates to succeed her.\n\nThe victorious Yousaf was the continuity candidate, utterly loyal to his predecessor and determined to follow her priorities, including pushing forward hugely controversial legislation on gender equality.\n\nRegan, something of a lightweight on policy, was the first candidate to fall in that race (shortly after defeat, she defected to the Alba party, established by former SNP leader Alex Salmond). But Forbes gave Yousaf a run for his money.\n\nEarly in the contest, Forbes - a devout member of the deeply socially conservative Free Church of Scotland - revealed that, had she been a member of parliament at the time, she would not have voted in favour of same-sex marriage.\n\nAlthough Forbes insisted she had no desire to roll back any existing equality legislation, senior SNP figures were among those briefing heavily that she must not become leader.\n\nYousaf ended up winning the leadership by just 52 to 48 per cent and, rather than clasping former finance secretary Forbes close, offered her a demotion she was compelled - correctly - to reject.\n\nThe tight result though brought to an end the myth that the SNP is a party of the radical left. In fact, a great many of its members were - and remain - entirely comfortable with Forbes's rather out-of-date views.\n\nWhile Yousaf blundered through a miserable year of leadership, which included major developments in a police investigation into SNP finances, Forbes sat on the backbenches, her reputation for competence growing on the basis that things couldn't get any worse than they were.\n\nForbes's views remain an issue for colleagues. Indeed, a key factor in Swinney's decision to return from the political twilight was the fear among senior figures that she might win a contest to succeed Yousaf and, in the process, create yet more division in a party already in crisis.\n\nAlong with her views on gay marriage, Forbes is no fan of the SNP's obsession with gender ideology.

Leaving aside her more controversial views on social matters like gay marriage - and many in the SNP will hope she does so in government - Forbes' more pragmatic approach to economics could form the basis for cross-party co-operation.\n\nHowever, while SNP politicians were stressing the need to be \"collegiate\", it remains to be seen whether the opposition will be prepared to play ball.

He also pointedly tweeted a \"no right turn\" road sign. Might the Greens try to bring down another SNP politician?\n\nGiven his fragile position, Swinney's decision to make Forbes his deputy was a bold, potentially risky move. But it was also a positive one. He has essentially done what we advised Yousaf to do amid the crisis that led to his downfall.

Fixing the NHS, education and the economy are pressing priorities that the SNP has failed to make sufficient progress on for years.\n\nSwinney and Forbes must now demonstrate that independence, blaming Westminster, and culture wars are now secondary to the task of fixing Scotland's most serious and fundamental problems.

John Swinney took a very hands-on interest in making Scotland's 2009 climate act a world class piece of legislation, says Dr Richard Dixon. ow will an SNP government led by John Swinney rise to the challenge of tackling the climate emergency? Swinney himself has some interesting history on the issue. There is no question that the Scottish Government had a strong incentive to focus on climate change while it contained two Scottish Green party ministers, had two Green special advisors, and was subject to an agreed programme of work on the issue in the Bute House Agreement. Now that Swinney's minority government will have to make deals on a case-by-case basis with whichever party is most amenable, it is hard to see there being so much attention on climate change. However, the urgent need to pass legislation to amend the failing targets and budgets in the 2019 climate act will have to be one of his early priorities. In the run-up to the 2009 climate act, I worked for WWF Scotland, based in Dunkeld. Our constituency MSP was John Swinney. He was also the Finance Secretary.

She entered government in 2020 as minister for Europe, migration and international development.\n\nShe is married to the former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale.\n\nNeil Gray was only elected to Holyrood in 2021, having spent the previous six years at Westminster.\n\nHe took over as health secretary earlier this year, after the resignation of Michael Matheson.\n\nThe native Orcadian was a journalist and producer with the BBC in Kirkwall before working for the former health secretary Alex Neil.\n\nA member of the Scottish Parliament since its inception in 1999, Fiona Hyslop has now served in junior and senior government roles under all four SNP first ministers.\n\nShe has been a member of the party for almost 40 years and stood unsuccessfully in council and Westminster elections before devolution.\n\nShe held the culture portfolio for 11 years between 2009 and 2020.\n\nSeen as one of the SNP's brightest young stars, Mairi McAllan became a minister immediately upon being elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2021 at the age of 28.\n\nThe former corporate lawyer and special adviser to Nicola Sturgeon joined Humza Yousaf's cabinet in the transport, net zero and just transition brief.\n\nThis became net zero and energy in February and she is another cabinet member retaining exactly the same role under Mr Swinney.\n\nOne of the SNP's most experienced campaigners, Angus Robertson spent 16 years as an MP for Moray before losing his seat to the Scottish Conservative leader Dougas Ross in the 2017 election.\n\nA German speaker who worked as a journalist in central Europe, he spoke for the SNP on foreign affairs and defence at Westminster and has been both the party's deputy and Westminster leader.\n\nSince being elected to Holyrood in 2021, he has been cabinet secretary for the constitution, external affairs and culture.\n\nA close friend and political ally of former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Shona Robison is another of the 1999 intake of MSPs.\n\nShe was a junior minister for public health and sport in her party's first government before joining the cabinet in 2014 but resigned as health secretary four years later.\n\nAfter a spell on the backbenches, the Dundee MSP re-joined the cabinet in the social justice brief before serving as Mr Yousaf's finance secretary and deputy first minister.\n\nShe offered to give up her role as deputy first minister in favour of Kate Forbes as a means of bringing the party together.\n\nShirley-Anne Somerville was an MSP from 2007-2011 before losing her seat.\n\nAfter a spell helping run the Yes campaign she returned to Holyrood in 2016 and has been in government ever since.\n\nShe has been education as well as social justice secretary and between these roles has handled controversial

We recognise the right of the SNP as the largest party in this chamber to form a Government, and we are content, in the spirit of stable governance, that they have managed to do so.\n\nThe Scottish Greens have worked constructively with John Swinney over many years, both as partners in government and from the opposition benches, and we look forward to building a similarly constructive relationship as he takes up the role of First Minister.\n\nHowever, our explicit support for an SNP First Minister has always been conditional on a shared vision and policy programme, one which tackles the climate crisis head on, which builds a fairer, more equal future, and which continues to make the case for an independent Scotland.\n\nThe new First Minister has yet to lay out the vision for his new Government, hence our Group's abstention in the vote today.\n\nI am proud of what the Scottish Greens achieved during our time in Government. Lifting 100,000 children out of poverty, delivering free bus travel for young people, banning new incinerators, the most polluting single use plastics, and putting in place emergency rent controls during the cost of living crisis. These are things which are making people's lives better already, thanks to the Scottish Greens.\n\nBut there was so much work still to be completed. We had just introduced a housing bill, which creates new rights for tenants and a permanent system of rent controls.\n\nOur Heat in Buildings programme was transforming the way we heat our homes, to drive down emissions and give everyone a warm home they can afford to heat. This has been billed as a template for the rest of the UK by the Climate Change Committee.\n\nThe process to appoint Scotland's new National Park was well underway, driving investment into Scotland's rural communities. The proposed Natural Environment bill would have created new protections and legislative tools to help restore nature in Scotland.\n\nBringing in a watertight ban on conversion therapy, to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\n\nThese remain our priorities as Scottish Greens, and we will continue to advocate for the fairer, greener, more equal Scotland that they create.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, the First Minister must lay out whether his government will continue with these progressive policies, as well as the recent commitment to ramp up action on the climate emergency, or whether he will retreat to the middle ground, and rely on the Tories and other pro-union parties to complete the work of Government.\n\nIf our parties can continue to work towards a shared vision of a fairer, progressive, independent Scotland which takes its responsibilities to future generations seriously, our door remains open.\n\nThe Scottish Greens will keep working for a better future, with courage and determination.

Centuries of faithful Catholicism followed by a leading role in the Protestant Reformation in the British Isles made Scotland a force in Christianity for a long time. Prominent Christians like pastor John Knox, author George MacDonald, physician John Abercrombie, and singer Sheila Walsh all hailed from Scotland.\n\nKate Forbes, a member of the Scottish Parliament, belongs on any list of influential, faithful Scots. She has served as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP) since 2011, and she has been a member of the Scottish Parliament since 2016.\n\nThe SNP is a largely center-left party whose members are united around the issue of Scottish independence from the UK. Forbes is one of the party's most conservative members, and she holds traditionally Christian pro-life convictions as well as believing in the biblical positions on sexuality and marriage.\n\nForbes told the BBC in 2021 that her faith is \"essential to my being. Politics will pass - I am a person before I was a politician and that person will continue to believe that I am made in the image of God.\" The BBC also reported that Forbes \"said she had a responsibility to represent all of her constituents regardless of any difference in their beliefs.\"\n\nInsiders have long seen Forbes as a rising star who is one of Scotland's best politicians. She's a compelling communicator with a vision for a prosperous, independent Scotland, but her efforts to advance her career recently ran into the secular buzzsaw.\n\nRecommended: The United Methodist Church Chooses the World Over Truth\n\nIn 2023, when Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon resigned in scandal, Forbes put her name forward to replace her. She finished second in the SNP leadership contest to Humza Yousaf, a Muslim.\n\nYousaf resigned earlier this spring after facing a no-confidence vote. By May 1, Forbes hadn't thrown her hat into the ring to run to replace him. That day, Iain McWhirter wrote in The Spectator that leftists in Scotland had declared war on Forbes:\n\nForbes, who is politically astute, highly articulate, and economically literate, would clearly be the most able candidate to lead the SNP. She is already significantly ahead of Swinney in the latest Ipsos opinion poll. But this has horrified the nationalist establishment and leftie journalists who have launched an almost hysterical campaign to have her stopped.\n\nForbes is being portrayed on social media as 'the candidate for the 19th Century' and a reactionary bigot by the SNP's many pro-LGBT activists.\n\nThis characterization, McWhirter says, comes even though Forbes \"comes across as a young, streetwise woman who just happens to be religious. She has never expressed any intention to roll the clock back to the days of backstreet abortions and persecution of homosexuals. Quite the reverse. She insists that, as a democrat, she has long accepted things like gay marriage even though they conflict with the strict tenets of her Christian faith.\"\n\nOn his podcast on Thursday, Albert Mohler highlighted an op-ed in a London newspaper that treated Forbes as if she had plans to bring Scotland back to the Dark Ages after recent radical left leadership in the country:\n\nThe article by Kenny Farquharson holds up some as political exemplars that are to be applauded, are to be appreciated, because they were progressivist statements. He mentions Nicola Sturgeon there in Scotland and also Humza Yousaf, who was \"the first Muslim to lead a national government in the Western world.\" Farquharson goes on to say, \"This in itself is an extraordinary badge of honor for Scotland.\" But when it comes to Kate Forbes, the threat was that she would be everything people like Kenny Farquharson do not want to see as representative of Scotland and its government.\n\nAnd it's because, the argument here is just really, really clear, it is because she's associated with a form of Christianity that poses a direct threat to the liberationist liberalism of the Scottish culture, now in an extremely secularized form. Farquharson says that what a leader believes is important. \"Who our leaders are matters. What they believe matters. What they represent matters.\" And Farquharson then asked the question, \"What message would a Kate Forbes first ministership send? That single mothers are sinners? That sex outside marriage is wrong? That ghouls should be allowed to stand in the streets outside abortion clinics, muttering incantations? That most of us in secular Scotland are going to hell?\"\n\nSecular leftists were up in arms because, as a Christian, Forbes' \"faith does not reflect the country she wants to lead.\" She eventually decided not to run for leader of the party or first minister, choosing instead to endorse centrist John Swinney, who won the election.\n\nFortunately, Swinney saw the value that Forbes brings to Scottish politics -- which secular leftists refuse to acknowledge -- and named her Deputy First Minister.\n\n\"This is a recognition that Scotland is a far more 'small c' conservative nation than the priorities of recent SNP governments might suggest,\" wrote Euan McColm in The Spectator on Wednesday. In other words, the leftists may have a big bully pulpit, but they don't represent the views of all Scots.\n\n\"The appointment of Kate Forbes to the second most powerful position in government will infuriate many on the nationalist left,\" McColm added. \"But the truth is she represents the views of a great many Scots - including half the members of the SNP.\"\n\nThe radical leftists in Scotland -- and elsewhere -- would want nothing more than to deny conservative, Bible-believing Christians a seat at the political table. Good for Swinney for recognizing what Forbes brings to the table. I, for one, am excited to see what her future holds.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_queen@pjmedia.com", "name": "Chris Queen",

They've been jouking about these corridors looking slightly dazed and sporting fixed grins, pretending they care not a jot.\n\nKate Forbes with John Swinney (Image: free)\n\nIn a devastating two-week spell they've lost everything: their places in government; their Harry Potter ministries and the cosy add-ons that came with them.

Doesn't she know that, around here, your Christianity must be checked in at the door and then approved by committee? Hopefully, she too will learn lessons.\n\nThe previous day, she'd worn a vivid green frock as she accepted the post of deputy First Minister. This seems to have been triggering for some Greens. Going forward, Ms Forbes will now perhaps consider submitting her apparel choices - as well as her religious beliefs - to the appropriate committee for approval.\n\nPatrick Harvie, chewing wasps, wasted no time in contrived pleasantries. He lamented the departure of 'progressive' ministers like Emma Roddick and Joe Fitzpatrick. Sadly for Ms Roddick and Mr Fitzpatrick their 'progressiveness' was in inverse proportion to their political acumen.\n\nMr Harvie traduced Ms Forbes for her outdated personal views. The 1950s were mentioned and the trauma of LGBT people across Scotland. Mr Swinney could have pointed out that Mr Harvie has known about Ms Forbes' religious beliefs for many years in government and then asked why it was only a problem now.\n\nInstead, he mollified them in a two-minute soliloquy that featured progressive and progressiveness seven times. Progressive taxes; progressive values; progressive attitudes; progressive progress.\n\nDouglas Ross then chose to ask the same question four times instead of asking the four different questions to which he's entitled.

All the drama over the past couple of weeks - from the almighty strop taken by the Scottish Greens, to Alex Salmond's brief return to relevance, to John Swinney's unlikely recasting as Scotland's latest Father of the Nation - has rather obscured this question.\n\nWhy, two weeks ago, did Humza Yousaf suddenly pull the plug on his Green partners, crashing his political career in the process?\n\nAs the dust settles on an extraordinary few days in Scottish politics, it's a question worth returning to.\n\nThe answer, I believe, tells us something important about where Scotland stands as we begin the long run-in to the 2026 Holyrood election.\n\nIt's also, I'd suggest, a cause for optimism.\n\nThe answer to why Humza pulled the plug on his deal with the Greens tells us something important about where Scotland stands, says Eddie Barnes\n\nMr Yousaf wasn't specific about his reasons when he held his fateful press conference two weeks ago.\n\nThe pact with the Greens had simply 'run its course', he declared. Perhaps he didn't want to spell it out.\n\nThe truth was quite simple: with possibly just weeks to run before a general election, Mr Yousaf junked the Greens because the deal had become politically toxic for the SNP, synonymous across Scotland with broken promises (on, for example, the environment), cock-ups (on, for example, the bottle deposit scheme) and fringe cultural issues (on, for example, trans rights).\n\nThe way the SNP and the Greens were running Scotland was going to cost the SNP seats, and it needed to change.\n\nThat final sentence sounds like the ultimate statement of the bleeding obvious but, in our strange political culture in Scotland, it marks a significant break with the recent past and from the way politics has been conducted here for the ten long years since our era-defining referendum.\n\nLet Professor Sir John \u00adCurtice, the great polling guru, explain.\n\n'The thing I've picked up,' Sir John said at the \u00adweekend, 'is that whereas as recently as 2022, people's \u00adwillingness to vote for the SNP was unrelated to their \u00adattitudes to the state of the health service and so on, now they are.\n\nTherefore the insulation of the constitutional question that has been around them for a long time, and indeed has become thicker and thicker over time, has been punctured.'\n\nIn short, the 2014 referendum changed our political culture.\n\nIt saw people identify as either Yes people or No people. The SNP benefited as the party of Yes, a position that hardened even further after the Brexit referendum.\n\nAs Sir John notes, the SNP discovered it was therefore insulated from the usual wear and tear that afflicts political parties in office, when the trains stop running on time or when the health service stops working.\n\nThis insulation meant that, in 2021, Nicola Sturgeon\n\ncould bring the Greens into government without needing to worry too much about whether they'd be any good at \u00adgoverning. Here was our Yes government in action.\n\nWhat has changed, however, is that the umbilical link that connected pro-independence voters to the SNP and the Greens has weakened.\n\nMany of these people have had enough of the way the SNP (and the Greens) have been running the country.\n\nIn focus groups, what used to be 'our' Scottish Government is now viewed, one UK Government source tells me, in the same negative light as everybody else in power. It no longer gets the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA significant poll last week found that more people now believe a Labour-led Scottish Government would do a \u00adbetter job of running Scotland than an SNP-led one.\n\nMany pro-independence voters will agree with that. The constitutional connection they felt with the SNP no longer blinds many of them to the failings the government has overseen. Hence the \u00adreason Mr Yousaf had to act to change the government.\n\nIt suggests that after a decade-long hangover following the referendum, Scotland may finally be returning to something approaching normality.\n\nAnother pollster, Peter Kellner of YouGov, recently took a deep dive into Scottish political attitudes.\n\nHis verdict was that, for the first time since the referendum, the next general election will be fought in Scotland on 'competence not the constitution'.\n\nI note that the 'salience' of constitutional matters - or how much they mean to voters when they cast their vote - is at its lowest ebb since the 2014 referendum.\n\nWe are, perhaps, finally beginning to move on.\n\nWe can all feel it, I think. The Westminster circus that helped feed Scotland's \u00adconstitutional fervour has begun to wane: not even Tory rebels these days can be \u00adbothered to muster much of a rebellion against Rishi Sunak. The crazy show is over.\n\nMeanwhile, in Scotland, the referendum era is beginning slowly to slip into history. The totemic ruling of the Supreme Court, preventing a Holyrood-run poll, has deflated the SNP's campaign entirely.\n\nAnd Father Time has been cruel for nationalism. These days the entire constitutional debate has grown stale and - frankly - very boring, symbolised best by the unreported papers on independence that the SNP government still insists on producing.\n\nIt's not all over, I should say: many Scots still want the \u00adability to yank the emergency cord if the UK once again acts like a runaway train.\n\nPro-independence voters are not necessarily changing their minds - it's just that these same Scots would really rather not have to break the glass on the UK, not when a scary world of pandemics, war and insecurity threatens our futures, thanks very much.\n\nThe fact the SNP has \u00adhappily swapped 'first activist' Mr Yousaf in favour of the softly-softly leadership of John Swinney suggests the Nationalists know it too.\n\nTwo-and-a-half years ago, in my first column in this space, I wrote that thanks to our unrelenting constitutional cold war, Scotland had got stuck.\n\nToday - in what is my last regular column here - I think we can finally begin to detect a shift in the weather. We're not yet unstuck but peer ahead and it's possible to make some predictions.\n\nThose weakening ties between constitutional allegiance and voter behaviour will put the SNP under greater pressure to deliver better \u00adoutcomes.\n\nIt means it'll get judged more and more on its actions.\n\nFailure to deliver will mean that at the 2026 election, the SNP may well shed seats.\n\nThat in turn could lead to a parliament similar to the one we elected in 2007 when the two largest parties - the SNP and Labour - were practically neck and neck.\n\nAnd that would mark a welcome shift. Such a parliament would require Nationalist and Unionist parties to cross the constitutional no man's land and seek to work together. It would necessitate consensus and seriousness.\n\nIt might just see MSPs tackling the deepening challenges Scotland faces and grabbing the many opportunities that are there for the taking.\n\nIt's not a time for gloom, in other words. Scotland has extraordinary strengths, a \u00adtalented workforce and can reasonably claim to be leading Britain in many of the new industries and sectors that will drive wealth creation over the coming years.\n\nIf our politics at Holyrood can catch up with the \u00adambitious nation around it that wants to get on in the world, then there is plenty of cause for hope.", "source": {"uri":

Every other minister was retained and keeps the same job as they did under Humza Yousaf.\n\nIt's a bit like a new football manager and his assistant taking over a failing football team - but keeping exactly the same players on the park. Swinney insists he is no continuity candidate.\n\nBut that's a hard sell to the voters when he has kept ministers in place who are widely viewed as failing to deliver on public services.\n\nIf you look at almost any area of Scottish life - schools, hospitals, trains, roads - there's a widespread perception that major improvements are required.\n\nChanging those in charge of these services might have signalled Swinney's drive to deliver on bread-and-butter issues like health and education.\n\nSwinney and his team will argue the ministers delivering these services need more time to bring about the improvements we desperately need.\n\nMany of them have had very little time to bring about radical improvements.\n\nHe will also argue that with himself and Kate Forbes at the helm, there will be a greater emphasis on improving public services.\n\nBut in attempting to keep senior members of his own party onside, Swinney has missed a chance to present himself as the real change candidate to the electorate.\n\nThis opens the door to Labour presenting themselves as the transformers who will make the difference that Scotland needs.\n\nIf our public services do not get any better, Anas Sarwar will claim only his party can turn things around.\n\nSwinney has an opportunity to make a difference - and he deserves his chance to shine.\n\nBut sticking with the same team means the real change is Swinney himself, so results rest on his shoulders, and the public will expect to see improvements ... and fast.\n\nIt's just not fare\n\nScrapping peak rail fares has been a huge success.\n\nSo it is unbelievable that SNP ministers are preparing to undo that good work by bringing them back.\n\nAt a time when we face both a cost of living crisis and a climate crisis, it's daft to be reintroducing deeply unpopular peak-time fares.\n\nNot least when regular fares already got hiked by 9 per cent back in April.\n\nIt makes not a jot of sense to hit commuting Scots with a rail costs double whammy when we're trying to get more people out of their cars and into trains.\n\nEspecially when this policy is working and getting us back closer to pre-pandemic passenger levels.\n\nScotRail is nationalised. The power is entirely in Holyrood's hands.\n\nDoubling fares for hard-working Scots who commute by rail would be two fingers up at them and two fingers up to the environment.\n\nSNP ministers must urgently rethink this - and figure out a better plan.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "record_view@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Record View", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Sarwar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anas Sarwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScotRail", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ScotRail"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32719655.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_John-Swinney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The Scotland that we want to build is one where everyone is free to be themselves and where climate action is at the forefront of our politics.\n\n\"The First Minister must lay out his programme and his vision for Scotland, and where these values lie within it.\"\n\nHarvie posted a picture of a \"no right turn\" sign on social media - an apparent warning for the new Government not to shift its policies to the right.\n\nThe Scottish Green co-leader further told The National: \"With the Scottish Tories targeting a fantastic organisation like LGBT Youth Scotland just as others down south have done with Stonewall, the appointment of a Deputy First Minister with deeply conservative views, and a wave of hostility toward our community in much of the media, it's essential that progressive voices are heard now, to prevent Scotland regressing to the toxic values of the past.\"\n\nFormer finance secretary Forbes was the first to arrive at Bute House - Swinney's official residence - in Edinburgh on Wednesday as he put together his top table.\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"I am deeply honoured to accept John's invitation to be his Deputy First Minister.\n\n\"This is a moment of extraordinary privilege for me. Having previously served in Cabinet, I know the duty that all ministers have to reflect the Government's priorities and the missions that drive them.\n\n\"I look forward to working with John and

The bill is giving our languages legal protection for the first time in their extensive history and that's why it is vital to have a First Minister who truly understands their importance.\n\nAs the former education secretary, Swinney has already shown he is willing to use his platform to promote Scots and Gaelic. But perhaps most significantly, he has acknowledged that the languages are not a political tool, but an integral part of Scotland's culture - even if there is no denying the role that pro-indy politicians have played in protecting them.\n\nReferring to Gaelic, Swinney said the \"good structures\" that were being put in place to support the leid during his time as education secretary were \"not a nationalist plot\" but a way to ensure \"fair treatment\" for a minority language that has existed for over 1000 years.\n\nREAD MORE: John Swinney's Scottish Cabinet: What changes have been made?\n\nSwinney has similarly legitimised Scots, describing it as \"an essential element of our nation's culture and heritage\".\n\nWriting as a Scots author, I have seen first-hand how separating Scotland's languages from politics is essential to promoting their legitimacy outside of Scotland and in the union. But this can only be done through comprehensive education, which the new Scottish Languages Bill has the potential to provide.\n\nAll too often, I have seen the Scots leid reduced to \"pretend language made up by the SNP\", when, the reality is that both Scots and Gaelic predate the Union by hundreds of years. It is therefore comforting to know that Swinney has personally viewed some of the many historic Scots texts housed at the National Library of Scotland, some of which go back as far as 1440.\n\nBut in order to change attitudes, a strong politician who can meet and overcome the challenges presented by the current economic climate is essential, even if that means obtaining further devolution to divert much-needed resources back into Scotland's cultural landscape.\n\nA prime example of why this is needed is Aye Write. Despite being one of Scotland's Scotland's premier book festivals, it initially failed to secure the funding it needed from Creative Scotland to showcase new and emerging literary voices in 2024.\n\nREAD MORE: AI deepfake video of John Swinney on Sky News goes viral on Twitter\n\nScotland's indigenous languages are of huge cultural significance and they need to be fostered for the benefit of Scottish people within and outside Scotland. Even more so when you consider their unifying of power in a Scotland that is more divided than ever by class and politics.\n\nA good example of the unifying power of our leids is a new Scottish deli that's proven a hit in London - Auld Hag's The Shoap. Popular with Scots and people from all over alike. It uses almost entirely Scots language signage and specialises in Scottish scran, showcasing not only the many foods that make Scotland great outside of Scotland but our language.\n\nThat's not to mention the renewed interest in the Scots leid prompted by Len Pennie's \"Scots Word of the Day\", which actually has a predominately American audience. Her promotion of the language even prompted someone at her London book launch ask if it is okay for non-Scots to use our leids, to which the answer was a natural yes.\n\nBut while I think it's important to discuss Scotland's languages outside of politics, a natural symptom of their promotion is a move towards independence. Every country should be free to govern itself and an awareness of what makes a country great - or should I say braw - only reinforces that.\n\nTaking Swinney's experience as a politician out of the equation, his age puts him in a fantastic position to promote the leids. Swinney, 60, is from the same generation as my parents, who grew up experiencing violence - verbal and sometimes physical - for daring to speak their native tongues, so he will understand why so much prejudice still exists today.\n\nBut Swinney has also seen first-hand how there is hope for the future through the revival Scottish languages have enjoyed in recent years - from Billy Kay making history by delivering a speech in Scots to all political parties in Scots in 2022 to the Scottish Languages Bill itself, which was only launched at the end of last year.\n\nWith this in mind, I invite the new First Minister to make fostering the new bill a priority. It is a key to the promotion and representation of Scottish culture at home and abroad that should not be overlooked. But given that Swinney has already used the Scots leid in his first parliamentary speech, and made space for Gaelic in the Cabinet, I am confident this is already the case,", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scots language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Gaelic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Library of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union of South Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comprehensive school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Style_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Style Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18058642/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

UK Government financial mismanagement, blah blah blah.\n\nYeah, we get it. But the point stands that SNP ministers would have plenty of cash to increase teacher numbers by 3500 - as they promised in 2021 - if they made different spending decisions.\n\nThey have chosen, instead, to spend cash on things like more generous benefits than Westminster, more generous pay rises for the public sector, free prescriptions for people on \u00a3100,000 a year, and so on.\n\nMoney doesn't grow on trees, and cloth has to be cut accordingly. It is no wonder they are struggling with yet another pledge they couldn't afford.\n\nIn the Holyrood chamber, Mr Swinney refused - four times - to give a clear Yes/No answer on whether the teacher promise he made in 2021 as Education Secretary would stand.\n\nLaughably, the First Minister had the brass neck to claim he was being \"clear\" with parents - while going out of the way not to be.\n\nMr Swinney's performance at his first FMQs on the hot seat was both odd and underwhelming.\n\nHe was clearly trying extremely hard to suppress the urge to bellow at his opponents - as he's spent the last decade doing - after saying he wanted to ditch shouty politics.\n\nBut in trying to force this softer approach, he gave the impression of someone who had glugged too much Night Nurse.\n\nWhen Patrick Harvie's inevitable character assassination of Kate Forbes arrived, Mr Swinney looked like he wanted to be anywhere apart from Holyrood.\n\nHe bowed his head and read robotically from a script about \"centre left\" values of his government.\n\nThere was no explicit defence of Ms Forbes after Mr Harvie's tirade - a bit strange given Mr Swinney has just appointed her as his No2.\n\nRegardless, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that it seems that normal service has resumed.\n\nThe problem for Mr Swinney is that he has claimed it will be different now he's in charge. Pesky journalists and opposition politicians will naturally want to put that to the rest.\n\nEarlier this week, the new First Minister promised a \"new chapter\" for the SNP and Scotland.\n\nIt's obviously still early days. But after yesterday's performance, it's looking very much like the same old story.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_musson@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Chris Musson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister's_Questions_(Scottish_Parliament)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister's Questions (Scottish Parliament)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austerity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Forbes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Harvie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Harvie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/MixCollage-09-May-2024-08-12-PM-1100.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

It is a legal right now and I am a servant of democracy, I am not a dictator.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with BBC Radio Scotland, she said she was a \"servant of democracy\" and stressed that she would defend the \"legal commitment\" the country had made to equal marriage.\n\nIn an interview with ITV, Forbes was asked if she supported the right to have an abortion under current laws.\n\nShe said: \"I couldn't conceive of having an abortion myself. I've seen my baby at 12 weeks and 20 weeks but yes, I defend the right of women to make use of that legal provision to access abortion.\"\n\nShe was further asked if this meant she would defend the current law which allows women to have an abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nREAD MORE: Stephen Flynn gives perfect reaction to Natalie Elphicke's defection\n\n\"My position is that I wouldn't change the law as it stands.\"\n\nAsked about legislation put forward by Green MSP Gillian Mackay (below) aiming to stop anti-abortion protesters from gathering outside clinics, Forbes commented: \"I think with the bill the basis of my position is that nobody seeks a termination lightly.\n\n\"There are emotionally vulnerable women seeking these terminations and they should do so free of fear and harassment.\n\n\"In that sense, the purpose of the bill makes sense. Any bill that is good law needs to make sure its targeted and that's where I've said I'm happy to work with her (Mackay).\"\n\nThe buffer zone legislation recently passed Stage 1 and Forbes voted in favour of the legislation.\n\nThe new Deputy First Minister also previously said it was \"up to\" individuals whether they had children outside of marriage although said it was something she would \"avoid\".\n\nAsked by Sky News for her views on having children out of wedlock, she told the broadcaster: \"It's entirely up to them. It's something that I would seek to avoid for me personally.\n\n\"But it doesn't fuss me, it doesn't put me up nor down. The choices that other people make is (up to them).\n\n\"In terms of my faith, my faith would say that sex is for marriage and that's the approach I would practice.\"\n\nShe added: \"For me, it would be wrong according to my faith, but for you I have no idea what your faith is. So, in a free society you can do what you want.\"\n\nDuring the leadership race, Forbes (below) also said she would not have voted in favour of the Scottish Government's gender reform bill.\n\nShe told the BBC she had \"significant concerns\" about self-identification for transgender people in Scotland and said she was unlikely to launch a legal challenge against the UK Government for its use of a Section 35 order.\n\nThe Court of Session ultimately did rule the UK Government could block Scotland's gender reforms from becoming law.\n\nForbes previously said: \"I have been on record saying I had significant concerns and therefore the bill in its current form I would have struggled to vote for.\n\nREAD MORE: Edinburgh: Three arrests as pro-Palestine protesters blockade Leonardo factory\n\n\"I would not have been able to vote for the principle of self-ID.\"\n\nHowever, she added that she \"understands the principle which is that the UK Government should not overturn Scottish legislation\".\n\nAfter John Swinney (below) was officially sworn in as Scotland's seventh First Minister, the Greens called on him to reaffirm his support for a \"fairer, greener, more equal Scotland\".\n\nThe party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said: \"There will be many people across our country who will be very concerned and who will want to know that this Scottish Government remains committed to a greener and more equal future for Scotland.\n\n\"When it comes to delivering fairer and more progressive taxation, a just transition from oil and gas and a watertight ban on so-called conversion therapy, it is vital that this government does not dilute the longstanding commitments that it has made.\n\n\"These are the values that the Scottish Greens remain committed to and that we will work for every day. The Scotland that we want to build is one where everyone is free to be themselves and where climate action is at the forefront of our politics.\n\n\"The First Minister must lay out his programme and

Both in doing their actual elected jobs as representing the people who elected them - and playing this pantomime act of subservience to a monarchy we now know, from polling this week, that Scots don't even want.\n\n\"It's long past time we put this charade behind us, and I hope we see the Scottish Parliament make a request to Westminster that the Scotland Act be amended so that Scottish Politicians can choose who they declare their loyalty to -

But Humza Yousaf's departure showed grace", "body": "An emotional Mr Yousaf addressed MSPs for the last time from Holyrood's front bench\n\nHumza Yousaf said he had promised his 15-year-old stepdaughter, Maya, that he would not \"embarrass her again\" by crying on national television. He lasted almost six minutes before breaking that pledge.\n\nSpeaking from Holyrood's front bench for the final time, the departing First Minister was overcome with emotion as he spoke of the racism he had battled from a young age, and the direction his life had taken in the years since. He was first told to \"go home\" at the age of six, he said. Back then, he could never have imagined one day leading his country.\n\nIt was a powerful moment. As both the youngest person to take on the job and the first person of colour to be First Minister of Scotland, Mr Yousaf's place in history is secure. His portrait hangs on the wall of Bute House in Edinburgh's Charlotte Square beside that of his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon - the first woman to hold the role.\n\nBut there is little doubt Mr Yousaf will also leave office with a lasting sense of regret. His decision to end the power-sharing deal between the SNP and the Greens was a monumental misjudgement. That, too, will be remembered.\n\nHe was dealt an extraordinarily difficult hand. Within days of Mr Yousaf being elected SNP leader last year, the police investigation into his party exploded into the headlines. The manner of his downfall, however, was entirely self-inflicted.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Yousaf has handled recent days with grace. Addressing MSPs, he said he would remember the \"kindness and generosity of colleagues over the years\". Elsewhere, he issued another passionate plea on behalf of the people of Gaza - an issue close to his heart.\n\nBut it was his comments about defying the racists and bigots that stood out. \"I was six years old when I was first told to go home, and I'm afraid since then it's been a regular occurrence,\" he said. \"In fact, almost daily if you look at my social media feeds.\n\n\"I won't lie, presiding officer, it is that racial slur that probably hurts me the most, very simply because I have no other home than this one. I never will, I never have. My heart will forever belong to Scotland.\n\n\"So to have the opportunity to defy the far-right, to defy the racists, to defy the bigots who told me to go home, but be in a position to serve my home, to contribute to public life in my home, and to have had the opportunity to lead my home - well, that has been the most tremendous honour that I didn't think was reserved for people who look like me.\"\n\nVisibly emotional, Mr Yousaf added: \"And there, I have broken my promise to my 15-year-old daughter. I hope that from my example, other little boys and girls who look or sound different know that it is our differences which make us unique, that should be celebrated as part of a modern and diverse Scotland, and that in no way should those differences ever hold you back from achieving your dreams.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scotsman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alistair_grant@scotsman.com", "name": "Alistair Grant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humza Yousaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bute_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bute House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consociationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Home_Automation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Home Automation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Home_Automation/Vendors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Home Automation/Vendors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjU3YmEwYjExLWUyNzAtNDRkOS1hN2QwLTVhNmIxOTBhZjAzYjo5YmJiYzM0ZC0wMWUxLTQxZjAtOGRjNy00YTI4MWEwZTIxODc=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546218", "eventUri": "eng-9546218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 87, "relevance": 1}

He added: \"We will set out our commitments as we take Budget decisions.\n\nPushed for a Yes/No answer by Mr Ross, the First Minister said: \"I've nothing really to add to Douglas Ross about the financial position we face.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Ross accused Mr Swinney of \"not being straight with the public\".\n\nWe told how parents took to the streets of Glasgow in protest at the SNP-led council's decision to axe 450 classroom posts.\n\nAnd campaigners raised fears over similar losses across Scotland as they urged the First Minister to step in and reverse the slashing of numbers.\n\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who spoke with some of those who gathered in the city's George Square on Wednesday, said: \"Of the teachers I met, one told me they had re-trained two years ago and was now going to lose her job.\n\n\"Another hasn't been able to get a permanent contract since he qualified, and a third said this doesn't feel like the thanks and reward the Government promised them coming out of the pandemic.\n\n\"John Swinney bears responsibility for the broken finances in our councils and the decimation of our education system.\"\n\nAnd speaking after FMQs, Tory chief Mr Ross said: \"John Swinney's repeated failure to stand by the pre-election pledge he made as education secretary to increase teacher numbers will have been heard loud and clear across Scotland.\"\n\nAt a post-FMQs media briefing, a spokesman for the First Minister said Mr Swinney had shown \"complete candour\" about the financial pressures faced by the government.\n\nBut when pressed by The Scottish Sun on why the First Minister refused to give a straight Yes or No answer about whether the pledge will still be delivered, the spokesman said: \"He gave a commitment that he wanted to look very carefully at this and he wanted to engage with local authorities, and indeed, with parents and others.\"\n\nMr Swinney's inaugural FMQs in the top job came just days after he was officially confirmed as the new SNP leader and First Minister following the resignation of Humza Yousaf.\n\nIn a speech accepting the leadership of the SNP this week - having stood unopposed for the job - Mr Swinney vowed to adopt a different approach to politics and suggested nothing would be achieved by \"shouting at people\".\n\nAnd before FMQs, new Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes heaped praise on Mr Swinney, saying he had been \"truly inspiring\" over the past week.\n\nMr Swinney - Nicola Sturgeon's No2 during her entire tenure as First Minister - revealed a \"new\" cabinet with only one change, bringing in Ms Forbes as Deputy First Minister. But all of Humza Yousaf's top team stayed in place.\n\nAs she walked to the Holyrood chamber for FMQs, the Scottish Sun asked Ms Forbes about her waspish comments during the 2023 SNP leadership race in the wake of Ms Sturgeon's resignation that \"continuity won't cut it\", and how that squared with the virtually unchanged regime.\n\nShe said: \"Well, I was very clear in my statement last week about why I wasn't going to run.\n\n\"I had huge confidence in the agenda that John Swinney had set out about uniting the party and the country and ensuring that we work together to deliver on the priorities of the people of Scotland.\n\n\"That remains my position, and I think he has been truly inspiring in the speeches that he's given over the last week, doubling down on his commitments to unify, to deliver and to ultimately make sure that as a government we are delivering for people.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"},

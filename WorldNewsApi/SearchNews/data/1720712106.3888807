But using a high-performing setting spray to lock in your foundation, eyeshadow and more can help prolong your look. I\u2019ve put several setting sprays through their paces over the years, including Urban Decay\u2019s All Nighter, Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish and Milk Hydro Grip. But there\u2019s a \u00a310 budget beauty buy that shoppers are saying gives all three of them a run for their money. I love all three of those higher-end setting mists, but I\u2019d be inclined to say that Milk\u2019s is my favourite. Priced at \u00a335, the alcohol-free mist is lightweight and seals in makeup, with a dual-phase formula that boasts both grippy and glowy properties for the ultimate finish on the skin.

With over 5 thousand sold on Amazon already and a 4.5 star rating, the \u00a310 spritz is set to be a summer must-have. Much like Milk\u2019s Hydro Grip, the e.l.f Power Grip is also a bi-phase formula, meaning you must shake the bottle to activate it. Similarly, it says it provides a dewy, long-lasting makeup look, which is similar to Milk\u2019s claims, too. Both ingredient lists boast hyaluronic acid and aloe, however, Milk\u2019s formula sees the likes of hemp-derived cannabis seed extract and niacinamide, while e.l.f\u2019s features squalane and green tea seed oil. But the real test isn\u2019t in name similarities or ingredient lists - it\u2019s in the performance, and could this affordable makeup bag must-have really compete with products more than three times its price? After applying my makeup as usual, I shook the e.l.f Power Grip setting spray to combine the water and oil layers. Usually, you have to hold setting sprays around 30cm from your face, but e.l.f\u2019s mist has a much shorter reach, so the brand recommends spraying from 6 inches. The first thing I noticed about this mis was how shockingly fine it is. It\u2019s so weightless it feels like absolutely nothing on your face - so much so that I had to question whether it was even hitting me, but it was. The e.l.f Power Grip primer is known for being a sticky formula to glue makeup down all day, so I had worried that the setting spray counterpart would have a tacky consistency, but that\u2019s not the case either. It\u2019s completely invisible and undetectable on the skin and doesn\u2019t leave annoying watermarks in your makeup like other brands. My skin didn\u2019t look matte, but it could have looked dewier if that is one of the main benefits of the bottle, but overall, I was really happy with how the mist had applied, and the results of my makeup overall. As for longevity throughout the day, my makeup certainly lasted longer than it would have without any setting spray at all. Unlike a lot of setting sprays, e.l.f\u2019s doesn't promise \u2018X amount of hours\u2019 of wear, yet it still kept my makeup looking good throughout the day until the evening before I started to feel oily, which is quite typical regardless of what I use. The \u00a310 cosmetics product has racked up a 4.3 star rating on the Amazon website, while at Boots , it boasts 4.6. Some shoppers have ditched their high-end sprays for the e.l.f alternative, saying it \u2018dries very quick;y\u2019 and \u2018helps makeup last all day\u2019. One said: \u201cThis is better than the Charlotte Tilbury setting spray by miles. This with the get a grip is flawless.\u201d Another added: \u201cI used to use Urban Decay, but this is definitely my new go to fixing spray from now on.\u201d A third commented: \u201cThis is amazing the fine spray is so good no need to worry about watermarks in just done make up !!I Use before primer and then 2 times during makeup and then once at the end - a small amount needed\u201d \u201cThis is a great setting spray,\u201d wrote a fourth. \u201cIt comes out in a really fine mist that dries very quickly and leaves your face looking dewy and hydrated. It keeps my makeup in place all day, even in very warm weather.\u201d However, some have said it leaves them feeling a little oily, adding: \u201cHonestly, not my favourite setting spray. But it does get the job done. It made me feel a little oily. But it did help my makeup last all day. Not sure I\u2019d buy it again, but it is being used!\u201d For me, the e.l.f Power Grip Setting Spray isn\u2019t quite as high-performing as some of the other setting sprays. I find that the Charlotte Tilbury one helps to melt makeup together to give that seamless finish, whereas Milk and Urban Decay offer more of a veil-like seal. E.l.f falls into the latter category, and while its non-sticky, ultra-fine formula is a dream to apply, the lasting power wasn\u2019t quite as good as some pricier ones I\u2019ve used. It\u2019s a great affordable alternative that I\u2019d recommend for those on a budget. If you have oilier skin, more of a matte setting spray may work better for you, such as the Mac Prep and Prime Fix+ Matte Mist, for \u00a329, or No7 Stay Perfect Matte Fixing Mist 100ml, which is under \u00a315.", "summary": "The e.l.f Power Grip Dewy Setting Spray has become an Amazon bestseller, with shoppers saying it's the best setting spray they've tried", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/tried-10-amazon-setting-spray-32980320", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32980304.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG_1742.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:09:34", "author": "Beffshuff,Bethan Shufflebotham", "authors": ["Beffshuff", "Bethan Shufflebotham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.164}

The 9th Earl Spencer announced his split from the Countess of Spencer to the Mail on Sunday on June 8. According to the outlet, their relationship became strained by the writing of his memoir, in which he revealed he was physically and sexually abused as a student at an elite boarding school. \u201cIt is immensely sad,\u201d Spencer told the Mail on Sunday. \u201cI just want to devote myself to all my children, and to my grandchildren, and I wish Karen every happiness in the future.\u201d The couple reportedly announced their divorce to staff at Althorp House, the Spencer family estate and Princess Diana\u2019s childhood home in Northamptonshire, England, in March. Spencer married Gordon, a Canadian philanthropist, in June 2011 after meeting on a blind date at a Los Angeles restaurant the previous year. They were married on the grounds of Althorp House, where Princess Diana is buried. Gordon is the founder of Whole Child International, a US-based non-governmental organization that works to improve the quality of care for vulnerable children. She was previously married to Mark Gordon \u2013 a Hollywood producer whose films and TV credits include Saving Private Ryan, Speed, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Criminal Minds \u2013 from 1997 to 2003. Gorden shares two daughters with her first husband, as well as 12-year-old daughter Charlotte Diana with Spencer. Meanwhile, Spencer has four children with his first wife, Victoria Lockwood, and two children with his second wife, Caroline Freud. The Mail on Sunday reported that the 60-year-old royal has \u201crecently become close\u201d to Norwegian archaeologist Cat Jarman. Along with Reverend Richard Coles, Jarman and Spencer co-host the history podcast, The Rabbit Hole Detectives. Friends told the outlet that the pair \u201clook very happy together\u201d but \u201cit is early days.\u201d In his memoir released in March, titled A Very Private School, Spencer opened up about the physical and sexual abuse he was subjected to in the 1970s. As a boy at Maidwell Hall \u2013 one of Britain\u2019s top independent schools for children aged four to 13 \u2013 Spencer was allegedly abused by a female assistant matron, an experience he recalled as \u201cincredibly traumatizing\u201d. Spencer, who joined the school when he was eight, said he was inflicted with beatings to the point of drawing blood and witnessed punishments including \u201ccutting buttocks [of young children] several times with a cane and carrying on\u201d. Other former students he interviewed revealed that they had been raped multiple times at the school, while some had lost their siblings to \u201cself-neglect\u201d. One terminally ill man stipulated a refusal to see his parents in his living will, as he could not forgive them for his experience. \u201cIt killed a part of me; it killed the gentler part of me. For us to survive in that environment, a small but important part of us had to die. I think that is the essence of it,\u201d Spencer told The Times in March. \u201cSensitivity, empathy, those sort of things must suffer, because otherwise it\u2019s too raw. You can choose to make the most of it, which I think is admirable if you can do it, but the damage is still inside.\u201d Maidwell Hall School told The Independent in a statement: \u201cIt is sobering to read about the experiences Charles Spencer, and some of his fellow alumni, had at the school, and we are sorry that was their experience. It is difficult to read about practices which were, sadly, sometimes believed to be normal and acceptable at that time. Within education today, almost every facet of school life has evolved significantly since the 1970s. At the heart of the changes is the safeguarding of children, and promotion of their welfare. \u201cWe have been dismayed to read about the allegations of the abuse Charles Spencer suffered by an assistant matron in the 1970s. Although we have not directly received any claims from ex-pupils, considering what has been reported, the school has followed the statutory process and made a referral to the LADO (Local Authority Designated Officer). We would encourage anyone with similar experiences to come forward and contact either Maidwell Hall, the LADO or the police.\u201d Elsewhere in his memoir, Spencer reflected on his previous divorces and revealed that he sought professional help to understand his relationship patterns. \u201cWhen looking at the wreckage of my first and second marriages, I learned early in therapy that being sent away to boarding school at eight years of age meant that I had next to no understanding of intimacy,\u201d he wrote, per an excerpt obtained by People. In an interview with the outlet, Spencer praised his wife Karen for supporting him during the difficult process of writing his book. \u201cKaren has been supportive,\u201d he told People. \u201cI think it was very challenging for her to have a husband going through what was essentially four and a half years of the most profound therapy with very difficult undertones to it. And she supported the idea of me doing it.\u201d \u201cI think she always hoped I would come out happier and healthier,\u201d Spencer continued. \u201cAnd that seems to be the case very much. So, I\u2019m grateful to have her standing by me while I went through this, what I now realize was an essential process.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The former couple were married in June 2011 and share 12-year-old daughter Charlotte Diana</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/charles-spencer-divorce-wife-diana-b2559477.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GC3McM3j-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:24:33", "author": "Meredith Clark", "authors": ["Meredith Clark"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.215}

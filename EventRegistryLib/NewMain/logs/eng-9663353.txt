He shocked the crowd by performing the chart-topping diss \"Not Like Us\" five times in a row, often letting the crowd take over, inviting an arena of thousands to shout lyrics that accuse Drake of being a \"certified pedophile\" and \"colonizer.\" Lamar had been considered by media outlets and social media users to be the \"winner\" of the Drake beef because of his sharp lyrics, quickly released diss tracks and dominance on the charts compared to Drake's diss tracks, making the \"Pop Out\" performance look like a victory lap.\n\nLamar centered Los Angeles and West Coast unity in his performance, which some perceived as a diss at Drake, who was criticized for using the AI-generated voices of West Coast rappers Snoop Dogg and the late Tupac Shakur in his diss track, \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\" \"\"Y'all ain't gonna let nobody disrespect the West Coast, huh? Y'all ain't gonna let nobody mock or imitate our legends, huh?\" Lamar said onstage while performing \"Not Like Us.\" \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music s***. A lot of homies to some street s***and for all of us to be on this stage together...this s*** is special man,\" Lamar said onstage.\n\nLamar added new lyrics to \"Euphoria\" in his performance, including the line: \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect,\" a reference to Drake purchasing the rapper's crown ring at an auction for more than $1 million.\n\nLamar and Drake traded eight diss tracks in quick succession between April and May in a highly dramatic feud that dominated the charts, social media and grew to involve a long list of other rappers and artists. Lamar took shots at Drake and rapper J. Cole in his feature on Future and Metro Boomin's song \"Like That,\" slamming them for previously suggesting on their song \"First Person Shooter\" that the trio makes up the \"big three\" of rap. J. Cole released (and quickly retracted) his own Lamar diss, \"7 Minute Drill,\" but after he recused himself, the feud became a clear Drake versus Lamar battle. Lamar and Drake traded wild accusations at one another across various diss tracks, with Lamar alleging Drake had pursued minors and had a secret daughter, both of which he denied in rap \"The Heart Part 6.\" On that track, Drake accused Lamar of abusing his wife and claimed he planted false information in hopes that Lamar would use it in diss tracks. Lamar shocked fans by dropping three diss tracks within a span of less than 48 hours: \"Meet the Grahams,\" \"6:16 in LA\" and \"Not Like Us.\" The dust on the feud had largely settled by mid-May, though Drake appeared to address the feud on his featured verse on Sexyy Red's song \"U My Everything,\" in which he rapped over a beat Metro Boomin dropped as a diss at Drake called \"BBL Drizzy.\"\n\nDrake-Kendrick Lamar Feud Timeline: Drake Deletes Diss Track References From Instagram (Forbes)\n\nKendrick Lamar's Drake Diss 'Not Like Us' Tops Billboard Hot 100 As Feud Takes Over Charts (Forbes)\n\nKendrick Lamar Is Winning His Rap Battle With Drake -- At Least On The Charts (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

an audience that sang every word of the hit Drake diss song which set a streaming record on Spotify in the United States.\n\nDuring his performance of 'Euphoria', Kendrick Lamar made it clear that he wasn't done punching at Drake as he tweaked the song's lyrics to convey a message to the Canadian rapper.\n\nDuring the performance, Lamar substituted the line \"Matter of fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him\" for \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect\" which is a direct message to Drake.\n\nAccording to Billboard, Drake bought the ring for $1 million and the Canadian rapper has constantly boasted about his purchase and even flaunted it in the music video for the Kendrick Lamar diss song 'Family Matters'.\n\nKendrick Lamar's demands come after Drake used Artificial Intelligence to deliver 2 Pac and Snoop Dogg verses on the diss record 'Taylormade Freestyle' where he called Lamar a disappointment to Compton rap legends 2 Pac and Snoop Dogg.\n\nKendrick Lamar has described 2 Pac as one of his major influences and he brought the 2 Pac experience to the pop-out show as he joined Dr. Dre to perform the late rapper's hit record

It was livestreamed on Twitch by Amazon Music.\n\nKendrick performed the track five separate times, each more explosive than the last. \"Y'all ain't gonna let nobody disrespect the West Coast, huh?\" Kendrick Lamar asked after holding out the oft-repeated \"A Minor\" lyric (a double entendre meant to mock Drake as Lamar accuses him of being sexually inappropriate with underaged girls) in the first edition. He largely let the crowd lead the second, and for the third, there were firey pyrotechnics, dancers, and a loud chant of the \"O-V-Ho'\" as he performed the song to completion. The audience demanded a fourth, for which many of the nights performers and other stars joined including YG, Steve Lacy, Roddy Ricch, ScHoolboy Q and Clippers point guard Russell Westbrook. There were dozens of people on stage as Kendrick rapped, danced, and dapped through them for a fifth time.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nLamar opened his set with his first solo Drake diss in this spring's beef, \"Euphoria,\" shrouded in red lights, falling fireworks and smoke. He eventually performed his \"Like That\" verse that ignited the beef too. He also played \"DNA,\" \"Alright,\" and \"King Kunta.\" Kendrick spent much of the show accompanied by former Top Dawg Entertainment label mates Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q.\n\nTruly, a case could have been made for Kendrick Lamar keeping \"Not Like Us\" off the setlist. Though the concert seemingly takes its name from the \"Not Like Us\" lyric -- \"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas\" -- Kendrick has clearly already done that over the course of five diss songs in his battle with Drake between late March and early May. The show could have been a celebratory lap that didn't acknowledge Drake's existence at all by keeping those tracks off the roster.\n\nInstead, Kendrick hit the ground running with the song that escalated their tensions. Yet in the end, he celebrated the concert as a moment to unify the many and sometimes fractured facets of Los Angeles' expansive hip-hop scene. \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, a lot of homies to this street shit,\" he said, noting that the show featured artists from several different gang factions. He promised this would be the first of more collaborative moves.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" debuted at Number One on the Hot 100 and hit Number One on Billboard's Rythmic Airplay chart dated June 15, signifying its dominance on radio. In it, Lamar accuses Drake of pedophilia and exploiting other rappers. Drake responded with \"The Heart Part 6\" accusing Lamar of domestic violence, distance from his children, and surviving sexual assault.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He brought out rappers, performers and others who worked on the show who come from different parts of Los Angeles on the stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said during the

Kendrick Lamar and Drake have been involved in a rap feud since the early 2010s, with the feud escalating in March 2024. The feud seemed to have come to a halt after a series of attempted break-ins at Drake's Toronto home. However, at Kendrick's Juneteenth show, he added new lyrics to \"Euphoria,\" which included a reference to a ring previously owned by Tupac Shakur, bought by Drake at an auction. Kendrick rapped, \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect\"\n\nRELATED: Pusha T Reacts To Kendrick Lamar Dropping His Name On Euphoria: 'Incredible Display of Battle Raps'\n\nKendrick Lamar's concert, \"The Pop Out - Ken and Friends\", is named after a lyric from his song \"Not Like Us\", a diss track aimed at Drake. The song, released a month ago, has been a huge success, reaching the top of the charts and becoming one of the most popular tracks in the feud between the two rappers.\n\nWell reacting to the concert on The Breakfast Club, Charlamagne Tha God gave Kendrick his flowers and declared him as the \"King of Hip Hop.\"\n\n\"To me, the show was about Drake as much as it was Kendrick Lamar becoming the undisputed heavy weight champion of hip hop. When it comes to this new generation that we been watching for over the last 15 years, Kendrick is the king of Hip Hop and it's not even close,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: Love To See It!

During his highly-anticipated show, Kendrick started off the show by choosing violence with the Drake diss \"Euphoria\" where he switched up a line to diss Drake again.

Next, Kendrick brought out the legendary Dr. Dre who performed \"Still D.R.E\" and \"California Love.\"\n\nRight after that, Kendrick performed \"Not Like Us\" after the track was introduced by Dre.

I'm not in the middle of it.

The whole thing would go down on Juneteenth, the annual celebration of Black emancipation in America, after a battle in which Lamar questioned Drake's status within the Black community.\n\nLamar, the most celebrated rapper of a generation, had unofficially won the most high-profile hip-hop diss war in 20 years. Fans who came in person (the event was also streamed on Amazon Music) arrived anticipating a victory lap.\n\nLamar's official merch booths offered T-shirts that referenced the Drake beef, but many fans opted to bring their own, far more pointed homemade versions. Using an app, Nicole Flemate from Reedley, Calif., pasted Drake's face onto a box of a drug used for weight loss that Lamar accused him of using. \"I took the little nice lady out and threw Drake on there. I looked for the worst picture of Drake,\" she said, all laughs and smiles.\n\nThe symbolism of the show being held on Juneteenth was not lost on the crowd, many clad in colorful shirts that celebrated the holiday. Ayeshia Garrett and her husband, Jamaal, who made the trip from Chicago, both wore Juneteenth attire. \"Everything Kendrick does has significance,\" she said. \"He wants us to think deeply, beyond the art. He's trying to educate us.\" She added, \"We have to show up and let Kendrick know we know what this is about.\"\n\nIrene Kirkland from Pasadena, Calif., found significance in how a line from the battle connected to the holiday. \"I remember Drake was saying, 'Oh you rap like you trying to free some slaves.' And then Kendrick comes back on Juneteenth -- the day that we were freed -- and then pops out with a Juneteenth concert. How epic is that?\"\n\nThe all-star lineup poured out during DJ Mustard's opening set. The crowd screamed for Tyler, jumped for Roddy Ricch and both screamed and jumped for YG. Before Lamar emerged, the crowd began to chant a vulgar taunt aimed at Drake that plays off the name of his OVO record label.\n\n\"Kendrick stood on business the whole time, for real. He didn't lie in anything that he said,\" the San Diego engineering student Adrian Vargas said. \"And Drake just did a whole lot of denying. Saying that he doesn't want to do this anymore, saying I don't want to beef anymore. Kendrick kind of solidified his spot as the best.\"\n\nWithin a set packed with hits, Lamar performed three of his five Drake diss tracks, opening with \"Euphoria\" and adding additional lines referencing Drake's purchase of a ring that previously belonged to Tupac Shakur. He punctuated the slight by covering Shakur's 1995 No. 1 \"California Love\" later in the set alongside Dr. Dre, who produced it. Members of the crowd rapped along to his incredibly wordy tracks aimed at his foe, sometimes pairing off and shouting the songs in their friends' faces.\n\nLamar closed the show by performing \"Not Like Us,\" over and over again, the crowd erupting like a powder keg for the first four of the five run-throughs. After the fifth and final version, a small, informal cypher of fans emerged. Jonny Williams, who flew in from Dover, Del., was part of the group rapping it a sixth time as the instrumental played and the crowd filed out. \"He could keep playing\" the song, he said. \"Honestly.\"\n\nThe beef, however, was only half the story. Gathering many of his guests onstage for a group photo, Lamar reminded the crowd that the event was also about something larger: \"Unity.\"\n\n\"It ain't got nothing to do with no back-and-forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here,\" he announced, underscoring how different factions of the Los Angeles rap world had showed up. The afternoon's ultimate goal, he said, was \"to bring all of us together.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriella_angotti_jones@nytimes.com", "name": "Gabriella Angotti-Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "christopher_r_weingarten@nytimes.com", "name": "Christopher R.

Starting at 4:00 p.m. local time, DJ Hed & Friends will take the stage, followed by Mustard & Friends at 4:45 p.m. and Kendrick Lamar and his \"friends\" at 5:45 p.m.\n\nIt still remains unclear who makes up these different friend groups, but fans will find out soon. However, with Mustard in tow, it's more then likely Kendrick will perform his \"Not Like Us\" diss track for the first time, which Mustard produced.\n\nAmazon Music previously announced on June 7 that it would be streaming the Pop Out concert. The show is presented by pgLang and Free Lunch and will be live streamed on Amazon Music's Twitch and Prime Video channels.\n\nKendrick Lamar Announces The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends Concert\n\nK-Dot announced The Pop Out - Ken & Friends Concert on June 7.

The show was a massive hit, stirring viewers from around the world to sing praises for Lamar across social media platforms as it was streamed live by Amazon Music.\n\nIt was such a sensation on Twitter that \"nah Kendrick\" was trending before the night was over.\n\nLocal and remote audiences enjoyed performances from a long list of other hip-hop artists as well as multiple renditions of the hit summer track \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nThe phrase \"pop out\" appears to be about Lamar's decade-long beef with fellow rapper Drake and also appears in \"Not Like Us\" to describe an action one must sometimes take to show your competitors that you mean business.\n\nSometimes you gotta pop out and show n -- -s\n\nCertified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em\n\nWalk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him\n\nPole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him\n\nKendrick Lamar and Drake have been feuding on and off since the early 2010s following collaborations between the two on each of their albums of the era. The conflict first erupted into the open in 2013 when Lamar dissed Drake (as well as several other rappers) in the song \"Control\" by Big Sean.\n\nLamar later clarified that the dissing was all in good fun, or \"friendly competition,\" but pop culture outlets latched onto the line about Drake and pushed the idea that the two were in a feud for the next 10 years.\n\nIn March 2024, the beef took a serious turn when Lamar dissed J. Cole and Drake in \"Like That.\" This was in response to J. Cole suggesting that the triad of rappers are the \"Big Three\" of the genre in his song \"First Person Shooter.\"\n\nDrake responded in April with \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\" The pair exchanged more diss tracks in May, including Lamar's \"Meet the Grahams,\" which accused Drake of some rather serious crimes.\n\nLamar was joined on stage by members of the Black Hippy collective including Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q who each performed their own solo work. Later, he brought out Dr. Dre for a joint performance of \"Still Dre\" and 2Pac's \"California Love.\"\n\nDuring other parts of the concert, \"Not Like Us\" producer Mustard took the stage with Tyler, the Creator, YG, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, and others for a set. NBA stars Russell Westbrook and LeBron James also made an appearance, as well as other artists including Jay Worthy, Tommy the Clown, Demar, Russell Westbrook, Ray Vaughn, Westside Boogie, and so on.\n\nDuring the concert on June 19, Lamar brought dozens of members from the notorious rival gangs the Crips and the Bloods on stage to demonstrate that the city of Los Angeles could stand united. Near the end of the show, Lamar himself was moved by the coming together of so many people despite the deadly violence affecting both sides of the long-standing conflict.\n\n\"This s-t making me emotional,\" he said to the crowd. \"We been f -- ed up since Nipsey [Hussle] died. We been f -- ed up since Kobe [Bryant] died. This is unity at its finest.\"\n\n\"We done lost a lot of homies to this music s-t, to this street s-t. For all of us to be together on stage, that s-t is special. Everybody on this stage got fallen soldiers.\"\n\nThe mention of the legendary late rapper Tupac can be added to the historical archives on the beef between Lamar and Drake. In July 2023, Drake purchased a ring designed by Tupac himself for $1.01 million at a historic auction.\n\nHe showed off his purchase to the world in an Instagram Story to promote \"Meltdown\" on July 28. It features a large gold crown studded with 10-carat cabochon rubies and pav\u00e9 diamonds.\n\nLamar took a moment during the pop out concert to bring up this lavish purchase of the coveted piece of jewelry.\n\n\"Give me Tupac's ring back.\"\n\nFive. Lamar performed \"Not Like Us\" five times in a row for audiences after the duets with Dr. Dre, who stayed on stage to help with this hit single marathon to wrap up the pop out concert. By the end, the crowd was rapping along with them word for word, never seeming to get tired of the beloved single.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsey_weedston@dailydot.com", "name": "Lindsey Weedston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Row_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death Row Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The man opened with \"Euphoria,\" and it was clear from Ken's very first note that this was going to be a nasty double-down against his opponent. While Drake hasn't said much to indicate his thoughts on the matter (though there are hints), there are many fans on both sides currently speculating on what his reaction must've been like and what he did or is doing right now that could reflect that.\n\nFurthermore, one of the main factors driving these Drake theories is that Kendrick Lamar had a lot of people in attendance that were not as obviously on Team K.Dot before, but certainly look like they are now. The biggest examples of this are a couple of NBA players. DeMar DeRozan (whom Kendrick rapped about leaving the Toronto Raptors on \"Not Like Us\") and Russell Westbrook took the stage to dance to the diss, and LeBron James and James Harden were in attendance. \"Lebron rapping along to 'the other vaginal option' gonna send Drake into a tailspin lmaooooo,\" one fan wrote.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar Urges Drake To Give Him Back Tupac's Ring In \"Euphoria\" Lyric Remix\n\nMeanwhile, another big factor of many of these reactions, especially from the OVO camp, is how Kendrick Lamar and the West Coast should thank Drake for this. After all, a lot of people see this success as a direct result of using The Boy's name for \"clout,\" as bizarre as it is to say one of the biggest rappers alive someone who needs any more of that. But there's a lot of new things that Mr. Morale did in the beef's aftermath, like speaking at Compton College and reuniting Black Hippy, that he might not have done if he didn't have good reason to. Nevertheless, Kendrick also made it clear that this moment means much more to him than any feud, and that this is just capitalizing on one domino that fell and created momentum for much more.\n\nFrom what these reactions indicate, there's no telling how Drake really feels about the Kendrick Lamar show right now. Maybe he'll respond with some subliminal disses, IG Story shade, or another sort of clap-back or public address. His fans reacted quite comically to all this as well, in amicable and not-so-friendly ways alike. All of them are valid, though. After all, most of us don't know what it's like to have about 17,000 people diss you on repeat about eight or nine times throughout a celebration.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriel_bras_nevares@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Gabriel Bras Nevares", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVO_Sound", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OVO Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Social", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Social", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Hippie", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Hippie", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/06/Kendrick-Lamar-Drake-Response-Pop-Out-Fan-Reactions-Concert-Hip-Hop-News-scaled-e1718889544938-2549x1575.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Long-simmering rivalries, resentments and pettier disputes were, for the moment, set aside in favor of a much greater purpose: hating on Drake.\n\nAs part of his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert in Inglewood, which was attended by thousands and live-streamed to millions via Amazon Music, Lamar brought up musical guests who represented both the old and new guards of rap music.\n\nLegendary rapper and producer Dr. Dre mixed it up with 33-year-old Tyler, the Creator, who's twice now won the Grammy for Best Rap Album. Lamar's fellow west coast rap stars Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock mingled onstage with NBA stars like LeBron James, James Harden and DeMar DeRozan; as well as various other local Los Angeles luminaries.\n\nAll of them came together to essentially dance on Drake's grave, demonstrating their pop culture supremacy. By the time Lamar came to the conclusion of his own set, the crowd was prepped, and Lamar ended up playing the diss track \"Not Like Us\" SIX TIMES in a row back to back.\n\nEver since the Kendrick vs. Drake diss track battle came to an unprecedented crescendo in early May, it's been unclear which party would strike next. Lamar dealt Drake blow after punishing blow -- an assault which culminated in the aforementioned \"Not Like Us,\" the now-proven summer banger that labels Drake a \"certified pedophile.\"\n\n\"Tryna strike a chord, and it's probably A-minor,\" Lamar taunts Drake in the song, played repeatedly on stage last night in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to Drake for comment on the event but has not received a response.\n\nDrake, in turn, accused Lamar of alleged domestic abuse on his May diss track \"Family Matters,\" in which he also insinuated that Lamar is not his son's biological father. But Lamar has cumulatively accused Drake of having a secret daughter, running a sex-trafficking ring and engaging in pedophilia, so it's safe to say Lamar is playing dirtier.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Along with being a celebratory night for Los Angeles rap, the performance at the Kia Forum in Inglewood marked the live debut of the many Drake diss tracks born from his beef with his rap rival.\n\nLamar kicked off the show with his six-minute diss track \"Euphoria,\" which included a new line: \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect.\" The lyric is a reference to the custom ring previously owned by the late Tupac Shakur, which Drake purchased at a 2023 auction for over $1 million.\n\nAlso included in Lamar's setlist were his other Drake diss tracks, \"6:16 in LA\" and \"Like That\" -- but most notable was his choice to close with \"Not Like Us,\" which he then performed five times in a row.\n\nAfter ending the song to the sound of thunderous applause, Lamar hit the replay button and gave the crowd four encores of the record-breaking diss track. Viral clips of the concert see the audience rapping along, with Lamar pausing in between to let the crowd deliver his scathing lyrics.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nLamar's feud with Drake goes back several years, but it escalated to new levels in April, when the two rappers began trading insults across a series of new songs. If social media and Lamar's concert are any indication, he's been crowned the unofficial victor of the feud -- in large part because of \"Not Like Us,\" which took the beef to the next level.\n\nIn the song, Lamar doubles down on his pedophilia allegations against Drake, accuses the rapper of \"colonizing\" Southern rap, and takes shots at his OVO entourage. The track broke Spotify records, becoming the hip-hop song with the most plays in a single day.\n\nWhile Kendrick and Drake's beef has been a sore subject in the hip hop community -- earning the rapper's criticism from several artists -- others have rallied to show their support.\n\nDuring his performance, the Compton-born rapper was joined onstage by nearly 30 California-native celebrities, including artists YG, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, Roddy Ricch, Tyler the Creator, and Schoolboy Q, producer Mustard, NBA players DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook, and dancer Tommy the Clown. Dr. Dre even stepped in to deliver the haunting intro line for \"Not Like Us,\" whispering into his microphone, \"I see dead people.\"\n\nTowards the end of the show, the celebs returned to the stage for a group photo and Lamar called the concert a celebration of their unity. \"This shit gets me emotional, dog,\" he told the crowd. \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, lot of homies to some street shit, and for all of us to be on this stage together? Unity from each side of motherf------ L.A?\" He added, \"This shit is special, man.\"", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Lamar first performed the track during his opening set and then brought it back for an encore.\n\nHe then performed it three more times, each time with more intensity than the last. The crowd was visibly hyped, and many fans were seen chanting along to the lyrics.\n\nUndoubtedly, the lyrics of the diss track hit hard. This includes the double entendre: \"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\" Referencing both musical notes and Drake's alleged preference for underage girls.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the concert was slated on a historical date. Performed on the celebrated Juneteenth, a federal holiday in the United States that marks the freedom of enslaved African Americans. It is also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. Juneteenth marks the anniversary of the announcement of the abolition of slavery in the United States. It took place on June 19, 1865.\n\nREAD ALSO: Kendrick Lamar Drops Third Diss Track \"6:16 in L.A\" Aimed At Drake\n\nThey Not Like Us is a scathing indictment of Drake, in which Lamar accuses him of being a snitch and a culture vulture.

The verse reads as follows:\n\n\"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I guarantee that I will show you some respect,\" he stated to reporters.\n\nClearly, this is a reference to a ring that was originally owned by the late Tupac Shakur and that was purchased at an auction by an anonymous buyer who was later revealed to be Drake from the previous year. The ring was obtained from an unknown buyer.\n\nDespite the fact that this is only one new verse in a violent battle between the two most prominent rappers, which Kendrick Lamar won without a doubt and which was virtually called off after a number of invaders attempted to break into Drake's home in Toronto, it is possible that there is more to come.\n\nIt is expected that Variety will publish an entire review of the concert within the next few hours. The performance featured personal appearances by a number of well-known artists, including Dr. Dre, Tyler, the Creator, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, and Ab-Soul, among others.\n\nThe performance was livestreamed by Amazon Music and its hip-hop/R&B brand Rotation as part of the company's \"Forever the Influence\" celebration of Black musicians and creatives for Black Music Month.\n\nThe celebration was held simultaneously with Black Music Month. For the purpose of celebrating Black Music Month, the concert was held.\n\nThe performance is referred to as \"The Pop Out -- Ken and Friends,\" and its title is derived from a distinct tune that is in the competition.\n\nKendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" is the song in issue. Kendrick Lamar raps in this particular composition, \"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show n -- s / Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em.\"\n\nThe song, which was published a month ago and was a diss track directed at Drake, has continued to ascend to the top of the charts. It is widely regarded as the most successful of the singles that Drake and Kendrick Lamar have produced together. A month has passed since the song was released.\n\nThe two rappers engaged in a battle in which they assaulted one another's physical appearances, made claims of paedophilia, and said that they had children from a prior relationship.\n\nA song by Drake called \"The Heart Part 6,\" which was a parody of Kendrick Lamar's long-running song series of the same name, was the closing track, and it revealed that Drake was becoming bored of the struggle between the two of them.\n\nKendrick Lamar's song series had been going on for a long time.\n\nRapping over the diss track \"BBL Drizzy,\" which was produced by Metro Boomin, Drake recently made a reference to the conflict.

As expected, the \"A-mnor\" line was a crowd favorite, with Kendrick simply letting the venue hold the moment the first time, and mimic Neo's fame bullet-time motion from The Matrix the second time.\n\nHowever, the truly epic moment was Kendrick inviting various rappers who repped different sets of Crips and Bloods, as well as NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, onto the stage, \"This sh*t making me emotional. we been f*cked up since Nipsey died,\" said Kendrick. \"We been f*cked up since Kobe died.\"\n\nIf you know anything about LA gang culture, you know Kendrick pulling that off and keeping everything peace was major.

Dot welcomed his mentor and iconic West Coast rapper Dr. Dre to the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., as he rose from underneath the stage for one of the biggest surprises of the night. \"I see dead people,\" Dre whispered as Mustard's signature Cali bounce on \"Not Like Us\" blared through the speakers.\n\nIn a red hoodie with jeans and a pair of Nike Shox (an outfit some fans compared to 2Pac's at the 1994 Source Awards), Kendrick had the 18,000-plus in attendance and rap world watching via Amazon Music at home in the palm of his hand.\n\nThe raucous crowd sang along to every last word of the \"Not Like Us\" live debut. They held the \"A-minor\" Drake punchline for what seemed like an eternity while Lamar basked in what he curated.\n\nBut that wasn't all. Kendrick ran the Drake kill shot back a second time and spun the block for a third round of \"Not Like Us.\" The fourth edition was the most special, as K. Dot proved West Coast unity about 15 miles northwest of where the Compton native grew up, while bringing various L.A. luminaries such as NBA stars DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook on stage, who essentially danced on Drake's figurative grave.\n\nMustard, G Perico, Hit-Boy, Blxst, Steve Lacy, Big Boy, Westside Boogie and Lamar's Black Hippy running mates joined the party alongside other gang members repping different sets across Los Angeles. Each took a turn dapping up Kenny on stage as he kept his breath control intact amid the distractions.\n\n\"This s-t making me emotional,\" Lamar admitted while gathering the blended crew for a group photo moment that he wished could last forever \"We been f -- ked up since Nipsey died. We been f -- ked up since Kobe [Bryant] died,\" he poignantly declared. \"This is unity at it's finest.\"\n\n\"Not Like Us\" wasn't the only Drake diss performed by Lamar for the first time as part of his explosive set. He kicked things off with the bristling \"Euphoria,\" which found him tweaking a lyric directed at the 6 God. \"Give me 2Pac's ring back and I might give you a little respect,\" he spewed. Lamar also brought out Ab-Soul to perform his verse on \"6:16 in L.A.\" mixed into his run of greatest hits.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" gave Kendrick his fourth Hot 100 leader as it debuted atop the all-genre chart on May 13 with over 70 million streams in the first week. The West Coast anthem sits at No. 6 in its sixth week on the Hot 100 while \"Euphoria\" holds at No. 47.\n\nWhile gang violence and street politics have cut lives way too short, Kendrick Lamar united a city for one night where territory allegiances and banging sets didn't matter in the name of hip-hop. \"It ain't got nothing to do with no back-and-forth records,\" Kendrick said, dismissing his Drake feud. \"It's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this s-t was about. To bring all of us together.\"\n\nFind more highlights from Kendrick's memorable \"Not Like Us\" performance below.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"},

The concert, part of Amazon Music's \"Forever the Influence\" celebration for Black Music Month, featured a star-studded lineup that included appearances from Dr. Dre, Tyler, The Creator, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and others. Dubbed \"The Pop Out -- Ken and Friends,\" the event was not just a musical showcase but also a celebration of Los Angeles' hip-hop heritage.\n\nThroughout the evening, Lamar performed his diss tracks repeatedly, notably performing \"Not Like Us\" five times-and the crowd reportedly went wild each time. Lamar's performance was more than just a confrontation; it was a statement of solidarity with his hometown of Compton, as he invited artists from various L.A. neighborhoods to join him on stage, reinforcing the theme of unity.\n\nThe concert also an A-list of celebrities. Among the attendees were NBA stars Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, and LeBron James, who joined Kendrick on stage.\n\nThe evening also highlighted Lamar's ability to blend personal and cultural commentary effortlessly, as Variety reviewed. While Kendrick Lamar's concert showcased his lyrical depth and his command over the stage.\n\nThe concert, which was streamed live and now seems to no longer be available for rewatch, has been the buzz all across social media.", "source": {"uri": "moguldom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moguldom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_brown@moguldom.com", "name": "Ann Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs_and_Venues", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Clubs and Venues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/moguldom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Untitled-design.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 124}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBut Drake's rival has gone the opposite way. Since the release of Lamar's final diss track \"Not Like Us\" -- on which the Compton rapper (baselessly) accuses Drake of being a \"pedophile\" and refers to him as a \"colonizer,\" among other things -- the song has been everywhere, from the club to children's birthday parties and bar mitzvahs.

The three-hour event, which was live-streamed on Amazon Prime, featured appearances from Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy, Ty Dolla Sign and YG, plus a slew of up-and-coming local rappers. Attended by 17,000 fans, including high-profile stars like The Weeknd, LeBron James and Ayo Edebiri, the concert was a showcase of Los Angeles unity -- \"Let the world see this,\" Larar told the audience. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru -- this ... is special, man..\"\n\nBut it was a victory lap for Lamar, who took the opportunity to dance all over Drake's proverbial grave.\n\nMusic 'Dundas Square don't shine as bright as you': Love it or hate it, Drake's new song is an ode to Toronto youth culture\n\nA new remix - a ridiculous parody of a 2005 emo-pop classic - was met with both laughs and confusion on social media.\n\nAfter performing a quick set with his Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, Lamar launched into his recent Drake diss tracks, including \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA.\"\n\nLamar was then joined onstage by legendary (and problematic) producer and rapper Dr. Dre to perform the West Coast classics \"Still D.R.E. and \"California Love.\"\n\nAfter quieting the crowd for a supposed \"moment of silence,\" Dre whispered \"I see dead people\" -- the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens \"Not Like Us\" -- sending the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLamar proceed to perform the song not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, but five times.\n\n\"Y'all ain't gonna let nobody disrespect the West Coast, huh?\" Lamar said to the audience.\n\n\"Oh y'all ain't gonna let nobody mock or imitate our legends, huh?\" he added, referring to Drake's ill-advised decision to use AI to imitate the vocals of Tupac and Snoop Dogg on his diss track \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\"\n\nAt one point, Lamar brought out former Toronto Raptor DeMar DeRozan and NBA star Russell Westbrook to join the revelry.\n\nAs the set closed, Lamar brought out all the performers for an epic group photo.\n\n\"(This) ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here,\" he said. \"That's what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs the show ended and Lamar exited the stage, the DJ hit play on \"Not Like Us\" one last time, letting the crowd rap the lyrics as they filed out of the venue.\n\nThe good new, for Drake at least, is that his $500,000 stake on the Oilers winning the Stanley Cup is still alive.

Drake dropped \"Family Matters,\" which accused Lamar of domestic violence. Minutes later, Lamar released \"Meet the Grahams,\" a brooding, hateful track claiming Drake had fathered a secret child. While the move gave Lamar the upper hand in the battle, it felt like we'd all lost some joy that we'd gained from the prospect of rap's two biggest stars putting out their most driven music to prove who was the best.\n\nLess than a day after \"Meet the Grahams\" hit the internet, Lamar dropped \"Not Like Us,\" and everything changed. The song was the final knockout blow to Drake. And on Juneteenth when he performed it five times to end Wednesday's \"The Pop Out: Ken and Friends\" show, turning a track -- and a moment -- centered on his disdain for a rival rapper into a moment of unity. And love.\n\nWhen it was announced that Lamar would host a concert in the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, fans immediately began speculating about what Kung Fu Kenny would do at the show. After all, his dissection of Drake had been so strategic, calculated, and relentless that anything was possible. Would he drop a new song? Would he parade out every rapper who's ever dissed Drake? Would there be a release of some new, devastating information about Toronto's very own?\n\nLamar did none of those things. Instead, he performed his Drake disses interspersed between some of his biggest hits to create a show that rivaled any we've seen in rap and the best rap concert I've ever enjoyed through a TV screen.\n\nBut don't get it twisted: He started with the Drake stuff. Namely, opening his set with the full six-minute version of \"Euphoria,\" his first full song in the battle. Artists usually don't perform rap songs this long, especially those that are mostly just bars, at concerts. And they definitely don't have the audience belting out every word. But \"Euphoria\" is different. It's one of the greatest diss tracks ever released and full of lines like \"what is it, the braids?\" that are endlessly quotable. Lamar's breath control during the show allowed him to articulate every line of the song with perfect inflection. And while \"Euphoria\" includes an endless barrage of Drake jabs, if you looked at the fans as they rapped along, they were screaming out lyrics with pure joy on their faces. Because Lamar's concert was about more than a vicious round of attacks on an enemy. It was a celebration.\n\nMost of the show's body was a trip down Lamar's memory lane. He reminded us that he has always had hits and anthemic songs like \"Money Trees\" and \"Humble.\" The former came with a guest appearance from Jay Rock with the rest of Black Hippy, Schoolboy Q and AB-Soul, jumping in and out of songs for a long-awaited group reunion. Finally, we got a shock Dr. Dre appearance, which was the show's only blemish as it's another example of alleged abusers being platformed in moments that are supposed to promote ideas of Black unity, again putting all of us, especially Black women, in a place of having to overlook harm to get to the enjoyment.\n\nAfter Dr. Dre exited the stage, it was time for the main event: \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nWhen Lamar dropped the song a few weeks ago, there was that dark cloud over the battle. If \"Euphoria\" was Lamar as rap's big, bad boogeyman, \"Not Like Us\" was him as a gentle but dangerous giant putting the entire West Coast on his back, crushing anything in his way.\n\nWith one infectious, silly, playful song, Lamar turned the feud into a moment of joy. Yes, the song includes some of the most pointed and ferocious lyrics of the battle -- besides asserting that Drake tried to colonize the Atlanta sound, Lamar also straight-up calls him a pedophile. But it's also become something more than a track about Drake.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" is a rebuke of culture vultures. It's a song about reclaiming Black American culture from people who dive in, glean what they want from it, and try to steal it for themselves. It's a song that evokes pride and joy beyond a simple one-on-one rap squabble. Yes, Drake was the bomb's target, but the shrapnel of \"Not Like Us\" can land on anyone within a five-mile ideological radius. When the song was released, viral clips showed parties full of Black people joyously singing along, dancing and embracing. \"Not Like Us\" became a No. 1 hit and the song of the summer.\n\nLamar understood the cultural impact of the song. So he finished his set with five performances of \"Not Like Us.\" The first three seconds of the first rendition took the roof off the Forum as fans erupted having heard the song they showed up to sing along to -- but Lamar stopped after the first verse. Then he started the song over and was silent as the entire crowd rapped every word. May I remind you, the song is 6 weeks old. The third time, he rapped the song with producer DJ Mustard on stage.\n\nHe did it again as the stage began to fill up with as many luminaries from all walks of West Coast life, from NBA ballers Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan to rappers YG and Schoolboy Q and, yes, even Tommy the Clown. Lamar made it a point to mention that the stage was full of people from different sections of the LA area, representing different gangs, some of them rivals, all coming together peacefully and celebratory for a Juneteenth party. Then we got the song again. And again.\n\nEven though Lamar was rapping about Drake, it didn't feel like Drake was anywhere near the song anymore. Instead, the lyrics \"they not like us\" were a rallying cry for maintaining culture and identity in the face of those who try to take it away. It was a moment of triumph in a city where some of the biggest streaming events of the past few years were funerals for rapper Nipsey Hussle and Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. It felt like a balm for a whole region.\n\nThe Pop Out concert, especially the ending, was a moment for Kendrick and the entire West Coast to remind us that they are bigger than their tragedies. They're resilient in their peace. Unyielding in their happiness. They're unwavering in their love of the culture and unabashed in their willingness to dance when joy is at their feet. These are the things they popped out and showed us.\n\nFive times.\n\nFive performances of a song that is the unofficial Juneteenth '24 anthem. \"Not Like Us\" is a defining West Coast song that will never go away. It'll be remembered for how it closed out Lamar's victory lap over Drake. It'll be remembered for the unforgettable moments and the dancing we saw on stage Wednesday night. But it'll also be remembered as the song that turned a battle of negativity into a chance to remind ourselves that we are dope.\n\nAs Lamar and about 50 of his closest friends exited the stage at the Kia Forum, \"Not Like Us\" played one last time. It reminded us that while the song's initial goal was to put the final nail in Drake's proverbial coffin, Drake's destruction is now a byproduct of a song that united, restored and reminded.\n\nThis is how a battle based on hate turned into an anthem that showed us love.", "source": {"uri": "andscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andscape"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He largely let the crowd lead the second, and for the third, there were explosive pyrotechnics, dancers, and a loud chant of the \"O-V-Ho'\" as he performed the song to completion. The audience demanded a forth, for which many of the nights performers and other stars joined including YG, Steve Lacy, Roddy Ricch, ScHoolboy Q and Clippers point guard Russell Westbrook. There were dozens of people on stage as Kendrick rapped, danced, and dapped through them.\n\nLamar opened with set with his first solo Drake diss in this spring's beef, \"Euphoria,\" shrouded in red lights, falling fireworks and smoke. He eventually performed his \"Like That\" verse that ignited the beef too. He also played \"DNA,\" \"Alright,\" and \"King Kunta.\" Kendrick spent much of the show accompanied former Top Dawg Entertainment label mates Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q\n\nTruly, a case could have been made for Kendrick Lamar keeping \"Not Like Us\" off the setlist. Though the concert seemingly takes its name from the \"Not Like Us\" lyric -- \"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas\" -- Kendrick has clearly already done that over the course of five diss songs in his battle with Drake between late March and early May. The show could have been a celebratory lap that didn't acknowledge Drake's existence at all by keeping those tracks off the roster.\n\nInstead, Kendrick hit the ground running with the track that escalated their tensions. Yet in the end, he celebrated the concert as a moment to unify the many sometimes fractured facets of Los Angeles' expansive hip-hop scene.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" debuted at Number One on the Hot 100 and hit Number One on Billboard's Rythmic Airplay chart dated June 15, signifying its dominance on radio. In it, Lamar accuses Drake of pedophilia and exploiting other rappers.

He also mocked the rapper for making \"microwave\" music in comparison to the Compton icon. \"If you enjoy microwave meals that's on you,\" he tweeted at Drake fans. \"We prefer cooked food on this side.\"\n\nDJHed's claim that everything said on \"Meet the Grahams\" is surprising on a completely different level, though. Kendrick Lamar accuses Drake of having a daughter that isn't part of his life. He also claims the rapper is knowingly perpetrating and allowing crimes to be committed against underage girls. The major reason fans balked at the claims of both Lamar and Drake is that neither rapper presented evidence to back them up. They merely said horrible things about each other and left it at that. The beef has cooled off in June. That being said, other rappers and industry insiders have alluded to the fact that there might be more to come.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danilo_castro@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Danilo Castro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlamagne_tha_God", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlamagne tha God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club_(radio_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Breakfast Club (radio show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_personality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio personality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/06/GettyImages-1686004364.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1426, "textEnd": 1431}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Not content with merely taking a victory lap after winning his battle against fellow rap superstar Drake, Kendrick Lamar turned his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert at the Forum into a cathartic livestreamed celebration of Los Angeles unity.\n\nLamar curated a three-hour concert featuring a mix of up-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. When it was his turn to take the stage, the 37-year-old rapper powered through a set with Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, performed his Drake diss songs \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA,\" then was joined on-stage by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe two West Coast titans performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before Dre quieted the roaring crowd by calling for a moment of silence. It was a misdirect. He then delivered the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens Lamar's chart-topping \"Not Like Us\": \"I see dead people.\"\n\nA crowd of 17,000 that included The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross rapped along to every word of the biting-but-jubilant DJ Mustard production, which Lamar restarted twice after the first verse and performed four times in full.\n\nShuffling, frolicking, dancing and spinning around him as Lamar strode the stage in a red hoodie: NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, Mustard, rapper Roddy Ricch and even a teenage dance troupe led by the krumping innovator Tommy the Clown.\n\nLamar reveled in the moment: \"Y'all ain't gon' let nobody disrespect the West Coast. Y'all ain't gon' let nobody imitate our legends, huh,\" he said, referring to Drake's use of an AI tool to mimic 2Pac's voice on one of his diss records.\n\nBut Lamar had more on his mind, calling out to specific men and women to join him on-stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru -- this ... is special, man. We put this ... together just for ya'll.\n\n\"This ... ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nAfter the final song, Lamar exited, saying \"I promise you this won't be the last of us.\" The stabbing horns of the \"Not Like Us\" instrumental kicked in once again and the crowd rapped the lyrics without Lamar as they filed through hallways out to the parking lot.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news",

Was he watching? I bet Drake was watching, and I bet he got his feelings hurt all over again.\n\nLast night was Kendrick Lamar's massive one-off Juneteenth concert at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. The show was billed as The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, and Kendrick only announced it a couple of weeks ahead of time. The show was obviously Kendrick's grand victory lap after he rinsed Drake in their historic feud and went straight to #1 with the anthemic \"Not Like Us.\" Kendrick performed many of his Drake disses, opening with \"Euphoria\" and ending by doing \"Not Like Us\" no less than five times in a row. But last night's event was bigger than Drake. It was also a truly exhilarating display of West Coast pride and unity.\n\nKendrick was the main event, so let's talk about him first. The LA-area crowd was absolutely electric all night, and Kendrick began his set with the live debut of \"Euphoria.\" The audience included tons of prominent rappers and basketball players, and the camera kept showing LeBron James, mutual friend of Kendrick and Drake, out there. That crowd rapped along word-for-word with this intricate six-minute diss track. It was a goosebump moment when they all bellowed out, \"What is it, the braids?\"\n\nKendrick wore way more jewelry than usual, but he was otherwise fairly nondescript, wearing glasses and keeping his hood up all night. (There's speculation that he intentionally dressed like 2Pac at the '94 Source Awards.) He never got too demonstrative, acting about as low-key as you possibly could while giving a massive hometown victory parade. As the set went on, Kendrick did all his hardest anthems -- \"DNA,\" \"Element,\" \"Alright,\" absolutely nothing from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. For \"Money Trees,\" Kendrick's old friend Jay Rock rose up in an onstage elevator, doing his legendary verse. This led to an onstage reunion of Black Hippy, with Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q visibly delighted to be back out with their original crew. \"Collared Greens\" hit especially hard. They all stayed out onstage and danced victoriously while Kendrick rapped \"King Kunta.\"\n\nFrom the Black Hippy reunion, Kendrick Lamar went into \"m.A.A.d. City,\" \"Damn,\" and his first performance of his feud-opening verse from Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That.\" It would've made sense for Future and Metro to be there, but the night was all about California, and the only rappers who appeared onstage all evening were the ones from the region. Case in point: After \"Like That,\" Dr. Dre materialized onstage, joining Kendrick for \"Stil D.R.E.\" and \"California Love.\"\n\nDr. Dre also kicked off the night's biggest moment, whispering the \"I see dead people\" intro to \"Not Like Us.\" From there, pandemonium ensued.\n\nKendrick stopped \"Not Like Us\" at the \"A minor\" line and then ran it back a few times. At one point, he basically let the crowd rap the entire track for him. He kept performing it as the stage filled up with well-wishers, including NBA greats Russell Westbrook and former Toronto Raptor DeMar DeRozan. At this point, the stage looked less like a performance and more like a celebration. Kendrick ended it by gathering up everyone to pose for a group photo.\n\nIt was a command performance. Kendrick rapped by himself -- no backing vocals, no hypeman other than the 17,000-ish fans in the building. He got his lyrics twisted up a couple of times, but not badly enough that anyone could complain. And he showed just how hard these songs can go off in concert.\n\nKendrick's performance was the culmination of a night that was already a powerful display of West Coast strength. Carson's DJ Hed opened the night, bringing out a succession of recent-vintage underground stars for a song apiece itself, including Remble, Rucci, Jay Worthy, AzChike, Westside Boogie, G Perico, BlueBucksClan, RJMrLA, Shoreline Mafia, and Jason Martin, the rapper formerly known as Problem. I knew some of those songs and didn't know others, but the crowd was on board for all of it. It ended with Tommy The Clown and a whole team of dancers showing off LA's extremely unique street-dance style.\n\nOnline, I saw some commentators grumbling that certain LA greats -- 03 Greedo, the associates of the late Drakeo The Ruler -- were excluded. Still, it had to take serious work to bring together all these artists from across the landscape of underground rap, many of whom have different gang affiliations.\n\nNext up was \"Not Like Us\" producer DJ Mustard, a West Coast star in his own right. Mustard brought out a bunch of more-famous Southern California stars for a song or two apiece: Blxst, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Roddy Ricch, and an extremely energized Tyler, The Creator. He ended by doing a mini-set with his old collaborator YG. (Drake namechecked YG on the opening of his Kendrick diss \"Family Matters,\" and it seems like that blew up in his face.)\n\nThe whole display was absolutely exhilarating, even if you only witnessed it through your computer screen. It's the kind of thing that every regional rap star should be doing, since it locked into so much of what's unique and great about LA-area music and culture. Kendrick said that this wouldn't be the last of these shows, but it's hard to imagine one that'll be better than this.", "source": {"uri": "stereogum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stereogum"},

The chants of victory were furiously bellowed wop wop wops and Compton's own Maximus stood center stage, hat cocked under a red hoodie, more chains dangling than he's ever worn in his career, the cocky conqueror daring anyone else to fuck with him. One of the biggest beefs the genre has ever seen had firmly concluded in his favor, and this was the celebration.\n\nThere are decisive wins, and then there's the hometown victory lap that Lamar took in the arena not far from where he grew up, where he invited nearly every Angeleno of note -- famous and infamous, legend and new jack, Blood and Crip, Steve Lacy and Russell Westbrook -- to do their best West Coast jig on the metaphorical grave that he put Drake in almost two months ago. But more importantly, with a lineup that included LA staples DJ Hed and superproducer Mustard before him, the Pop Out became an event that placed Kendrick Lamar within the wider tapestry of Los Angeles rap mythology.\n\n\"Y'all ain't gon let anyone disrespect the West Coast, huh? Y'all ain't gon' let anyone mock and imitate our legends?\" Lamar asked the crowd after his first run of \"Not Like Us.\" It was the only time he addressed the beef directly outside of the actual bars, but it served as a mission statement for the entire event: a moment of unity, not quite against Drake, but in support of the rich LA culture that Kendrick is inextricably a part of. A win for Kendrick is a win for the west.\n\nOn \"Euphoria,\" early in what would become a five-song beef pack, Lamar cast their confrontation as being bigger than him -- that his weariness and disdain for Drake was \"what the culture feelin.\" By the time he reached his grand conclusion with \"Not Like Us,\" he'd sharpened that angle, accusing Drake of having no cultural northstar -- the kind of outsider who would wantonly mimic Tupac and comment on which rappers bang which sets while squabbling with the city's prodigal son. It was a grave misread on Drake's part, and last night we saw the result: YG, one of the very same rappers Drake tried to shout out, proudly twisting his fingers on an Amazon-sponsored stream to the tune of a song calling Drake a sex pest. Drake mocked Lamar's music for \"trying to get the slaves freed;\" Kendrick responded by calling him a colonzier and performing that song five times in a row on Juneteenth.", "source": {"uri": "gq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Me_(Ben_E._King_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stand by Me (Ben E.

The buyer was later revealed to be Drake.\n\nLamar went on to play hits including DNA, Alright, Swimming Pools (Drank) and King Kunta.\n\nHe was joined during the set by Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, with whom he formed the hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy, to perform M.A.A.D. City and That Part.\n\nLamar also performed his verse from the Future and Metro Boomin' song Like That, which ignited this year's war of words.\n\nTowards the end of the show, which was streamed live on Amazon, Lamar brought out West Coast rap legend Dr Dre, acting as his hype-man on raucous versions of Still D.R.E. and California Love.\n\nDre then teed up the first performance of Not Like Us by whispering the opening line, \"I see dead people\".\n\nExcitement for the song had been building throughout the night, with the crowd chanting its lyrics at various points in Lamar's set.\n\nWith each repeat, Lamar was joined by more and more guests.\n\nBy the end of the night, there were almost 30 people on stage, including YG, Steve Lacy, Schoolboy Q, Big Boy, G Perico, DJ Mustard, and basketball stars Russell Westbrook and Demar Derozan.\n\nThe gathering marked a rare moment of solidarity from Los Angeles' often fractured hip-hop scene.\n\nPausing to take a group photo, Lamar told the crowd: \"This is unity, y'all just don't know man\".\n\nHe dedicated the show to the musicians and friends they had lost to violence, saying: \"Everybody on this stage got fallen soldiers.\n\n\"For all of us to be together, that [expletive] is special,\" he continued.\n\n\"We put this together with peace... I promise this won't be the last of us.\"]\n\nThe show ended with a sixth, instrumental, version of Not Like Us, played as fans left the arena.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Oh y'all ain't gonna let nobody mock or imitate our legends huh?\" Lamar said during the performance, according to the outlet.\n\nThe rapper, who also performed his Drake diss track \"Euphoria,\" then highlighted the lyric, \"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" which alleges Drake likes underage girls.\n\nThe crowd were also incited to chant \"OV-h--,\" which is a lyric from \"Not Like Us\" that references Drake's 2014 album, October's Very Own.\n\nAlong with Dre, 59, Lamar, 37, also brought out West Coast stars including Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch and Ty Dolla $ign, while DJ Mustard kicked off the concert and paid tribute to the late Nipsey Hussle and played their collaboration \"Perfect 10\" as everyone lifted their phone lights into the air.\n\nThe one night only performance -- which was held on June 19, a day commemorating the freedom of slaves in America -- also saw Lamar bring dozens of musicians from historically feuding sections of South Los Angeles together onstage for a group picture.\n\n\"But you ain't never seen this many sections on one stage. Let the world see this. We need to show everything\" Lamar said of the moment. \"This is unity. Unity from all of sides of LA, East LA to West, Crips, Bloods, this makes me emotional.\"\n\n\"It was amazing, just a cultural moment,\" Tamara Gulley, a concertgoer tells PEOPLE.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

The 37-year-old rapper performed his viral hit \"Not Like Us\" five times in a row to close out the set, and once again took over social media. Fans thought that this beef was over, but now they're wondering if Drake will make some kind of response.\n\nLamar marked Juneteenth with a massive show at The Forum in Los Angeles, California, inviting other artists from the city to perform and commanding the stage for about 90 minutes himself. The whole event streamed live via Amazon, and is still circulating online at the time of this writing. Lamar reunited with some old collaborators, graciously platformed younger artists while showing deference to those who came before him, and of course, he played some of the biggest hits from his career. However, he opened and closed the set with his recent Drake diss tracks, and they arguably were the strongest through-line of the setlist.\n\nDrake opened with \"Euphoria,\" with some changes to the lyrics to emphasize the celebration of west coast hip hop culture. He played seven more conventional songs before playing the diss track \"6:16 in LA,\" this time featuring rapper Ab-Soul, then five songs layer he played \"Like That\" - the last song in this exchange that wasn't an outright diss track. Of course, the main event was the closer. Drake played two songs with Dr. Dre, who hung around on stage to introduce the first round of \"Not Like Us.\" Dre himself whispered the introductory line: \"I see dead people.\"\n\nLamar cut the song short only to start it over, end it early again, and start it a third time run it all the way through. After that, Lamar ended his set, but returned to cheers for an encore to play \"Not Like Us\" once again - this time with producer Mustard on stage as well. Finally, Lamar finished the night with a fifth round of \"Not Like Us,\" joined on stage by some of the biggest acts that had come out to perform with him, including Mustard and his old group Black Hippy.\n\nJust as many famous names were in the audience, according to The Associated Press. The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross were all in attendance. Lamar left no doubt that this was a show of solidarity, in some ways, calling for a group photo on stage by saying: \"Let the world see. For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side... L.A., Crips, Bloods, Piru - this... is special, man. We put this... together just for y'all. This ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nFans are in awe of this coordinated performance, and many heads are spinning as they try to predict what could come next. Some suspect a response from Drake is imminent - be it another diss track, a similar event or simply a shady social media post. So far, the rapper has not made any public reaction.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Hippy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/05/20/bea9e14d-3dcc-42b1-b06c-553a17a72141/kendrick-lamar-getty.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 139}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Not content with merely taking a victory lap after winning his battle against fellow rap superstar Drake, Kendrick Lamar turned his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert at the Forum into a cathartic livestreamed celebration of Los Angeles unity.\n\nLamar curated a three-hour concert featuring a mix of up-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. When it was his turn to take the stage, the 37-year-old rapper powered through a set with Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, performed his Drake diss songs \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA,\" then was joined on-stage by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe two West Coast titans performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before Dre quieted the roaring crowd by calling for a moment of silence. It was a misdirect. He then delivered the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens Lamar's chart-topping \"Not Like Us\": \"I see dead people.\"\n\nA crowd of 17,000 that included The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross rapped along to every word of the biting-but-jubilant DJ Mustard production, which Lamar restarted twice after the first verse and performed four times in full.\n\nShuffling, frolicking, dancing and spinning around him as Lamar strode the stage in a red hoodie: NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, Mustard, rapper Roddy Ricch and even a teenage dance troupe led by the krumping innovator Tommy the Clown.\n\nLamar reveled in the moment: \"Y'all ain't gon' let nobody disrespect the West Coast. Y'all ain't gon' let nobody imitate our legends, huh,\" he said, referring to Drake's use of an AI tool to mimic 2Pac's voice on one of his diss records.\n\nBut Lamar had more on his mind, calling out to specific men and women to join him on-stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru -- this ... is special, man.

That's what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nAfter the final song, Lamar exited, saying \"I promise you this won't be the last of us.\" The stabbing horns of the \"Not Like Us\" instrumental kicked in once again and the crowd rapped the lyrics without Lamar as they filed through hallways out to the parking lot.\n\nMore from this section\n\nBlack Chamber of Arizona to Host 2024 Juneteenth Vision Forward Celebration presented by Cox Communications\n\nOne Man's Tragedy Becomes a Treasure: Announcing the Release of 'Concrete Dreams'\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

It was a show so good I wouldn't have believed the hype this morning had I not stayed up to watch it myself on the surprisingly crispy Amazon Prime Video stream.\n\nThe four-hour concert was more than a victory lap, though. Sure, Lamar used his set to hammer home the point he won, performing Not Like Us five (FIVE!) straight times to close the show, in addition to doing Euphoria and Like That. But it was also a night of nostalgia, unity and just all around good vibes.\n\nIt opened with performances from other California artists before transitioning into a set by DJ Mustard, with performances from Tyler the Creator, YG and Dom Kennedy, among so many more. Then K. Dot finally did his thing and a good night got even better.\n\nThese were the best moments from Kendrick Lamar's finale.\n\nOpened with Euphoria (with new lyrics)\n\nIt didn't take long for us to learn what type of time Lamar was on, because he opened his set with what is still in my opinion the best song to come from his beef with Drake. To my knowledge this was the first time Lamar ever performed Euphoria, or any of the disses for that matter.\n\nThe energy in the arena was palpable through the screen. And not only did Lamar do the whole six-plus minute hookless song in its entirety, he added new lyrics: \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nBlack Hippy reunion and a Money Trees performance\n\nAfter taking us on a journey backwards through his catalog, from DAMN. to To Pimp a Butterfly to good kid, m.A.A.d city, Lamar landed on his 2012 hit Money Trees, which set the stage for Jay Rock to perform his popular verse before diving into some of his other hits.\n\nBut that was just the start of what turned into a nostalgic reunion of TDE's Black Hippy, with Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q eventually joining Lamar and Rock. And of course Q had to do some of his hits too.\n\nThis meant something to some of us!\n\nThe Like That verse\n\nThis was the song that kicked off the \"big three\" beef, so it was a big moment to see Lamar perform his verse. And it hit just as hard in concert as it did the first time we all pressed play on the Future and Metro Boomin smash.\n\nUnfortunately, Future was one of the few artists not in attendance to do his part of a collab. That's the only thing that could have made this better.\n\nA Dr. Dre set with a twist at the end\n\nIt wouldn't have been a legendary show without having one of the West's living legends come out, and Lamar checked that box by having Dr. Dre do a couple songs in the middle of his own set: Still D.R.E. and California Love.\n\nBut Dre wasn't done after that. Before he left the stage, Lamar asked him if he had anything else to say. That's when Dre broke into a whisper that's become synonymous with the metaphorical death of Drake's career:\n\n\"Psst. I see dead people.\"\n\nAnd right on cue, Lamar jumped into Not Like Us.\n\nNot Like Us (x5!)\n\nThis is when the grave dancing really begun, because Lamar didn't do Not Like Us once, twice or even three times to bring his show to a close. He did it FIVE times.\n\nAnd the first two times, he dropped the beat right as packed arena was singing \"A minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\" And if you know the reference, you know the message he was trying to send to you know who. This was a victory lap unlike any seen before it.\n\nHe had the entire crowd singing it and everybody at home. There ain't no coming back from this for Drake.\n\nInvited folks on stage, including Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan\n\nThere were some celebrities in attendance besides the artists performing, including Lakers star LeBron James. But when Lamar invited his California family on stage at the end, Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan were among the locals to come up and vibe out to Not Like Us with Lamar.\n\nAnd yes, that's DeMar DeRozan who spent nine years as a Toronto Raptor, which had to be another zinger to Drake's ego. Look at how much fun Westbrook is having.\n\nIn the end, though, it turned into a beautiful moment, as Lamar had all these people from different backgrounds, hoods and cliques come together for a good time and a beautiful photo to cap it all off.\n\nThis was really a special moment in hip hop.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [],

There are straight-ahead pop songs that stimulate the imagination, deeply rooted metaphors that take multiple close readings to untangle, and political songs diving into the history of Black oppression. Sure, there are more popular rappers, but it's easy to argue that few are better, more well-rounded, or more talented on a bar-for-bar level.\n\nWith only a few solo albums under his belt, Kendrick has managed to turn the rap ecosystem into a food chain from which he eats. He is an indisputable king of rap, a future bust recipient on Mt. Rushmore. With that being said, it is nearly impossible to pick only 33 K.Dot songs to highlight his stunning discography. The Compton-born MC is more than an album artist; everything he touches turns to gold. Without further ado, here's our best crack: The best 33 Kendrick Lamar songs (for now).\n\nClick here to listen to Kendrick Lamar's best songs on Spotify.\n\n33. For Sale? (Interlude)\n\nK.Dot is always willing to expound on the politics of the music industry, examining the good and evil that propels the game forward. On \"For Sale? (Interlude),\" he takes a look at the way rappers are forced to show off gold, cars, and women to prove their wealth, while refusing to succumb to these traditional standards.\n\n32. Jay Rock - Vice City feat. Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul\n\nOn \"Vice City,\" Jay Rock recruits a few TDE mainstays to flesh out his sharp commentary on the role Black women play in society. Kendrick Lamar nails the chorus, showing the struggle between stacking paper and knowing the struggles spending money will cause. He spits, \"I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope/I can't stand myself/I just bought a new coat, I might go broke/I can't stand myself.\"\n\n31. The Blacker the Berry\n\nWith a message as powerful as the one within \"The Blacker The Berry,\" Kendrick Lamar knew he needed to assemble a crack staff. K.Dot recruited Terrace Martin, Robert Glasper, Lalah Hathaway, Thundercat, and Anna Wise to round out the instrumental, giving Kendrick plenty of space to spit profound ideas on the racial inequalities at the heart of America.\n\n30. LUST.\n\nThe concepts are straightforward on Kendrick Lamar's DAMN.. \"LUST.,\" in particular is about routine, how quick and easy it is to disrupt these moments of habit in favor of things like lust and desire. Kendrick muses on the concept, eventually realizing that giving in to these cravings is simply a part of life, whether we like it or not.\n\n29. LOVE.\n\nOn Kendrick's \"LOVE.,\" he sings about the women in his life who have helped make him the man he is today. Kendrick and Zacari duet during the refrain, asking for devotion and trust in his character: \"If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?/If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?/Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me.\"\n\n28. Big Shot feat. Travis Scott\n\nAs if the Black Panther film wasn't a big enough blockbuster, the soundtrack features Kendrick Lamar and Travis Scott flexing their skills on \"Big Shot.\" In an interview with *Billboard*, Scott explained their relationship, saying, \"I met him at the [MTV Video Music Awards] one year and he came up to me and was just like, \"Yo, man, I fuck with your music. It's super dope and inspirational.\" I was like, whoa, this is the best rapper in the globe - he fucks with my music!\" The rest is history.\n\n27. HUMBLE\n\nKendrick Lamar wasn't always sure \"HUMBLE.\" would be a hit, but his team convinced him otherwise. The song eventually became the lead single for DAMN., but the beat was made by Mike Will Made It for Gucci Mane. K.Dot got his ears on the beat, and after spitting over it, the duo decided to put it on Mike Will Made It's debut album Ransom 2, but his team convinced Lamar to keep it for his upcoming album.\n\n26. Hood Politics\n\nOn the song \"Hood Politics,\" from To Pimp A Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar's shifts his voice into an upper register, giving himself the POV of a younger man, trying to get out of the hood and struggling with the lessons he would learn as an adult.\n\n25. Sherane aka Master Splinter's Daughter\n\nHow do you start off one of the best hip-hop albums of all time? For Kendrick Lamar and his breakthrough g.o.o.d. k.i.d. m.A.A.d. city, he choose \"Sherane aka Master Splinter's Daughter,\" a mesmerizing ode turned dire in only the way Kendrick knows how. What begins as a thrilling romance turns dangerous as the song ends with Kendrick driving to Sherane's house, only to see her surrounded by two dudes in black hoodies.\n\n24. Big Sean - Control feat. Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica\n\nListening to Big Sean, Jay Electronica, and Kendrick Lamar going bar for bar on \"Control\" is a masterclass in rap songwriting. The seven-and-a-half-minute song is featured on Sean's 2013 album, Hall of Fame. All three rappers bring their A-game, but Kendrick steals the show and causes controversy all at once, calling out a dozen or so rappers by name and telling them he wants to shred them all in the booth.\n\n23. Rigamortus\n\nKendrick Lamar has so many hits, it can sometimes be overlooked that the Compton-born MC can quite simply rap his ass off. On \"Rigamortus,\" from his early West Coast classic, Section.80, Kendrick shows off that skill, comparing the rap game to a body in rigor mortis, with toxins escaping a body that's left to rot and decompose.\n\n22. Poetic Justice feat. Drake\n\nOn \"Poetic Justice,\" Kendrick Lamar and Scoop Deville sample Janet Jackson's \"Any Time, Any Place\" and flip it into a brand new experience. Deville shopped the beat around for a while, with a number of artists (such as 50 Cent) wanting to spit over it, but he eventually gave it to Lamar, who turned it into a monumental rap song.\n\n21. ADHD\n\nKendrick Lamar often reflects on his hometown of Compton, California. On \"ADHD\" from Section.80, he relates the current over-medicating of young Americans with the high drug and medication tolerance of people born during the 1980s. It's an early example of Kendrick as sociologist, examining the links in American history and how much of it comes from root causes of white supremacy.\n\n20. XXX feat. U2\n\nI certainly didn't have Kendrick Lamar teaming up with U2 on my Bingo card, but the two teams made it work on DAMN. standout \"XXX.\" The song takes a close look at moral ambiguity, with Kendrick eventually coming to the thesis that anyone's moral compass can be broken under the right circumstance. Bleak, but not wrong.\n\n19. Die Hard feat. Blxst and Amanda Reifer\n\n\"Die Hard\" is the fourth track on Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, and on the track K.Dot recruits LA-based rapper Blxst and Barbados-born crooner Amanda Reifer to support his musings on insecurities and growth, reflecting on his role as a man and father.\n\n18. Keisha's Song (Her Pain)\n\n\"Keisha's Song,\" taken from Kendrick Lamar's 2011 album, Section.80, gave early fans a glimpse into just how talented he is. Kendrick recorded the song for his little sister, showing the weight and trauma prostitution can cause for women, though very explicitly refusing to demonize them, instead highlighting the societal inequalities that force so many women into this work.\n\n17. All The Stars feat. SZA\n\nKendrick Lamar and SZA teamed up for an all-star collaboration from The Black Panther soundtrack, so it only makes sense they'd name the song \"All The Stars.\" The song, to put it mildly, was a hit. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and the 91st Academy Awards, as well as receiving four nominations at the 61st Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\n16. Compton\n\nHearing Kendrick Lamar and Dr. Dre go bar for bar over a Just Blaze is a rap fan's dream. Luckily, on \"Compton,\" the album closer from good kid m.A.A.d. city, the duo let loose. As always, Kendrick impresses with a fancy couplet, spitting, \"Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it/ Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us/ And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor.\"\n\n15. Complexion (A Zulu Love) feat. Rapsody\n\nKendrick Lamar's \"Complexion (A Zulu Love)\" sheds light on the issues of colorism in popular culture, especially how they negatively affect standards of Black beauty. In an oral history of the album, Kendrick explained the inspiration behind the song, saying, \"The idea was to make a record that reflected all complexions of Black women. There's a separation between the light and the dark skin because it's just in our nature to do so, but we're all Black. This concept came from South Africa and I saw all these different colors speaking a beautiful language.\"\n\n14. Institutionalized feat. Bilal, Anna Wise & Snoop Dogg\n\nOn To Pimp A Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar follows up the triumphant \"King Kunta\" with \"Institutionalized.\" The former track finds Kendrick on a high, celebrating his ascent to rap's upper echelon. On \"Institutionalized,\" he recruits Bilal, Anna Wise, and Snoop Dogg to paint a different picture, one in which he realizes the cold realities of g.o.o.d. k.i.d. m.A.A.d. city remain, no matter how fast he runs.\n\n13. DUCKWORTH\n\nKendrick Lamar's \"DUCKWORTH,\" taken from 2017's DAMN., finds Lamar in his storytelling bag. This time around, he spits about former gangbanger, Anthony Tiffith, who would go on to start Top Dawg Entertainment, and his father, who went by the name Ducky. Kendrick looks at their relationship before K.Dot signed to the label, creating a warm, full-circle moment for the MC.\n\n12. How Much a Dollar Cost feat. James Fauntleroy & Ronald Isley\n\nYou can listen to \"How Much a Dollar Cost\" from To Pimp A Butterfly, and be amazed by Kendrick Lamar's storytelling, his ability to weave metaphors about poverty, selfishness, and the role of God, but perhaps the only convincing you need of its brilliance is that President Barack Obama named the track his favorite of 2015.\n\n11. Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)\n\nIt's poetic that Kendrick Lamar situates \"Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)\" in Compton, the same neighborhood crippled by Reagan's draconian war on crime. But on the catchy Section.80 cut, Kendrick sounds defiant, singing, \"We're far from good, not good from far/ 90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard/ With the top down, screamin', \"We don't give a f -- k\"/ Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt.\"\n\n10. Untitled 02 | 06.23.2014.\n\nShortly after releasing To Pimp A Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar quickly returned with a thrilling and mysterious project titled untitled unmastered. \"Untitled 02 | 06.23.2014.\" is a standout, sounding like many of the tracks from Butterfly. The song examines Kendrick's duality as both a Compton resident and a global superstar.\n\n9. N95\n\nOn \"N95,\" one of many standout cuts from Lamar's 2022 album, Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers, the MC namechecks the masks used by many during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lamar turns in one of his most impressive vocal performances to date, reflecting on modernity as he spits, \"The world in a panic/The women is stranded/The men on a run/The prophets abandoned.\"\n\n8. LOYALTY. feat. Rihanna\n\n\"LOYALTY.\" is Kendrick Lamar's attempt at a radio hit, but his inability to dumb it down gives it satisfaction on critical, intellectual levels, too. Of course, Rihanna turns in an absolute gem of a hook, but Kendrick uses that starting point to explore his psyche over a beat that's a funk-pop-hop gem.\n\n7. Money Trees\n\nKendrick Lamar's \"Money Trees\" has tons of memorable lines, but are any better than, \"It go Halle Berry or hallelujah/Pick your poison tell me what you do/ Everybody gon' respect the shooter/ But the one in front of the gun lives forever.\" It's just four bars, but it does a perfect job of conveying the themes of the song, in which Kendrick has returned from his encounter with Sherane and her two friends, deciding the best course of action.\n\n6. Backseat Freestyle\n\nWe all know Kendrick Lamar can rap, but holy shit does he prove his outsized talent on \"Backseat Freestyle\" from good kid m.A.A.d city. Though graphic, Kendrick blends his sheer brilliance and hilarious one-liners, rapping, \"All my life I want money and power/ Respect my mind or die from lead shower/ I pray my d-k get big as the Eiffel Tower/ So I can f-k the world for 72 hours.\"\n\n5. Wesley's Theory feat. George Clinton and Thundercat\n\nKendrick Lamar begins To Pimp A Butterfly with the utterly intoxicating \"Wesley's Theory,\" which features George Clinton and Thundercat. On the track, Kendrick establishes the themes of the record, particularly white supremacy in America controlling Black artists for profit.\n\n4. Swimming Pools (Drank)\n\nFor Kendrick Lamar, \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" is sort of where it all began. It was the first single from good kid, and introduced him to a much wider audience. It's an intoxicating hit, which finds Kendrick struggling to deal with the social pressures affiliated with drinking.\n\n3. Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\n\n\"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\" is obviously an instant classic, but it didn't always begin that way. Originally, the chorus was supposed to feature Lady Gaga's vocals, but scheduling conflicts prevented the collaboration from happening. The song is a staple in Kendrick Lamar's discography, but it's hard not to wonder what could have been had the two linked up after all.\n\n2. Alright\n\nFew things are better than Kendrick Lamar letting his fans know that despite everything else, things may end up working out. The song eventually became associated with Black Lives Matter after several youth-led protests were heard chanting the chorus, showing the unflinching power of Kendrick's vision.\n\n1. Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\n\n\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying Of Thirst,\" is to put it mildly, an epic. Planted towards the end of good kid m.A.A.d. city, the two-part track clocks in at 12 minutes and is widely cited among Kendrick devotees as his best pure lyrical performance. While that ranking is up for debate, it is certainly one of his most outstanding performances, which is saying a lot.", "source": {"uri": "udiscovermusic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uDiscover

From top to bottom, the entire event was a love letter to West Coast hip-hop culture, including a special appearance from Dr. Dre himself.\n\nBefore the doors even opened for the highly anticipated show, the crowd was stimulated and curious about what was to come for the rest of the evening. Lines started forming around the venue on Wednesday morning, with people dressed in their own personally designed merch.\n\nThe Pop Out, a nod to a lyric from Lamar's hit single and diss track \"Not Like Us,\" sold out almost immediately when tickets went on sale, an indicator that fans were more than hyped to witness Lamar on stage following his heightened sparring match with Drake. For those who weren't lucky enough to snag tickets to the actual event, the concert also live-streamed on Prime Video and the Amazon Music channel on Twitch.\n\nAfter spending over $1,500 on a pair of tickets, a father and son duo Damien and Dominic Camarena who are both born and raised in Los Angeles stood in a line outside of The Forum starting at 10:30 in the morning to see Lamar perform. Standing in the mid-afternoon heat before the doors opened, Dominic gushed, \"I was really young when I got put on to Kendrick. I was about 9 years old, so just being here with my dad is really special because I got put on by him.\"\n\nIt was already a party outside of The Forum prior to the concert; while people were waiting around, they were able to hip up several merch stands, photo ops, and food and beverage stations. There was even a voter registration station, courtesy of HeadCount, encouraging concertgoers to make sure they're all set to vote in November.\n\nOnce the lights went down close to 4:30 pm PT, DJ Hed kicked off the evening by introducing the crowd to a slew of West Coast artists who each graced the stage for about one or two songs each. From Remble, Ray Vaughn, and Cuzzos, to Westside Boogie, Zoe Osama, Bino Rideaux, Ohgeesy, and Jason Martin, The Pop Out commenced with nearly a dozen artists who all stem from California roots, setting the vibe for the rest of the night.\n\nHitmaker and L.A. native DJ Mustard, who produced the beat behind Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" delivered a set of his popular songs and also brought out iconic artists like Dom Kennedy, Tyler the Creator, YG, Ty Dolla $ign, Blxst, and Roddy Rich. Not to mention, Mustard played a trio of Nipsey Hussle tracks in honor of the late L.A. rapper and inspired everyone to raise their phones and turn their camera lights on.\n\nIn anticipation of Lamar's appearance, fans chanted \"Kendrick\" and \"OV-ho\" throughout the sold-out arena without being prompted. As the rapper rose from the bottom of the stage, the audience was exhilarated that his first song of choice was \"Euphoria,\" setting off an energy that reverberated throughout the entire Forum. Lamar delivered a selection of his classic hits -- including \"Loyalty,\" \"ELEMENT,\" \"Alright,\" and \"Swimming Pools\" -- and was also joined on stage by collaborators Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and none other than Dr. Dre.\n\n\"This shit we have going on tonight is bigger than me,\" Lamar told the crowd.\n\nTo cap off the night, Lamar performed his viral hit \"Not Like Us,\" a total of five times. The crowd exploded with enthusiasm when the beat dropped and Dr. Dre whispered, \"I see dead people,\" introducing Lamar's first live performance of what's arguably the song of the summer (if you talk to anyone who listens to hip hop). \"Y'all ain't gonna let nobody disrespect the West Coast, huh?\" Lamar asked his loyal listeners, with each performance of the song growing in fervor. Five times wasn't enough for the crowd who was entranced with Lamar's every word, having already memorized the lyrics to the number one charting diss track.\n\nInterrupting fans reciting the lyrics to \"Not Like Us,\" Lamar brought out the dozens of artists who showed up to The Pop Out so they could all share the stage and celebrate together. Gathering for a final photo of the night, Lamar said, \"Let them see this. We put this together with peace.\"\n\nAs if Lamar hadn't already solidified his place as winner of the rap beef, Wednesday night's show served as a victory lap.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com",

The show featured an opening set from DJ Hed, followed by DJ Mustard and a host of performances including Tyler, The Creator, YG, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, a surprise reunion from Black Hippy and Dr. Dre. The highly anticipated show continues to be the talk of the town nearly 24 hours later for several reasons: K-Dot unleashed another diss toward Drake on \"Euphoria,\" Kendrick performed \"Not Like Us\" five times and what was commonly mentioned was the unification of gangs on the stage and at the show. It's worth noting that gang culture is very prevalent in L.A., and the unity displayed last night was no small feat.\n\nOne person tweeted, \"Amazon executives watching all these pirus on stage wondering what in the F**K they just greenlit.\"\n\nAnother person said, \"Kendrick got Gangchella going crazy right now.\"\n\nOther people shared their thoughts on Kendrick Lamar's concert being the nail in Drake's proverbial coffin. An X user typed, \"I lived long enough to see Aubrey get Ja Ruled. Namaste. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd.\"\n\nA different tweet said, \"THIS HOW YOU SUPPOSED TO TREAT YA ENEMIES KICK THEM WHILE THERE DOWN AND KEEP KICKING THEM AND DON'T STOP KICKING.\"\n\nThe Success of Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\"\n\nKendrick Lamar's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends concert has given the West Coast plenty of reason to boast, especially following the overall success of K-Dot's \"Not Like Us.\" In addition to the diss track toward Drake becoming an anthem, it also topped the Billboard Hot 100 back in May and currently sits at No. 6 on the chart. The DJ Mustard-produced joint was the presumed ending of Kendrick and Drake's rap standoff.\n\nCheck out more amusing reactions to Kendrick Lamar's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends show below.\n\nSee Hilarious Tweets About Kendrick Lamar's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends Concert", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aleia_woods@xxlmag.com", "name": "Aleia Woods", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Hippy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Dolla_Sign", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Dolla Sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/06/attachment-kendrick-lamar-show1.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 319}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Some of the people on stage included DJ Mustard (who produced the record), Black Hippy (Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q), Compton rapper YG, L.A. Clipper Russell Westbrook, singer Steve Lacy, radio host Big Boy, Tommy the Clown (along with his talented crew of child krumpers), choreographer Charm La'Donna and allegedly members of every gang in L.A.\n\n\"This s -- gets me emotional,\" Lamar said. \"We done lost a lot, a lot of homies to this music s -- . A lot of homies to some street s -- and for all of us to be on this stage together; unity from each side of motherf -- L.A., Crips, Bloods, Pirus -- this s -- is special, man.\"\n\nHe added, \"We put this s -- together just for y'all.\"\n\nLamar announced his \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" show, which was produced with his label/creative agency pgLang and Free Lunch on June 5, just days after organizers of the annual Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival in South L.A. -- where thousands of Black Angelenos have been congregating on the special holiday for several years -- announced that it was canceled due to costs and safety concerns. The historic performance also came roughly a month after Lamar's vicious rap beef with Drake, in which he was deemed the winner by internet scorekeepers.\n\nReal 92.3's DJ Hed was first to take the stage around 4:20 p.m., bringing out a number of guest performers including Kalan.FrFr, Westside Boogie and Cuzzos (a girl rap group) and Tommy the Clown along with his group of krumping child dancers.\n\nNext up was Grammy winning producer DJ Mustard, who also welcomed several of his collaborators and friends to the stage including Blxst, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Roddy Ricch, recent high school graduate 310Babii, and Tyler, the Creator. He also made a dedication to late rapper Nipsey Hussle during his DJ set.\n\nThroughout the intermissions between sets, the crowd chanted the lyric \"OVHOE,\" one of the catchiest in a long line of memorable lines at the end of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nFollowing a recorded introduction from rapper E-40, Lamar emerged onto the stage and opened his set with his Drake diss track, \"Euphoria,\" as a bright red light shined on him. His hawk-eyed fans wasted no time to post on social media that he'd added a new bar to the song: \"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nLamar went on to perform some of his older tracks including \"DNA,\" \"Element\" and \"Alright,\" all of which carried a different weight following the Drake beef. But one of the best moments during the show was undoubtedly when Lamar reunited with Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul on stage.\"\n\nAfter Lamar performed his verse from Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" he brought out Dr. Dre -- his longtime mentor and collaborator -- to perform his classic hits \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love.\" Before he left the stage, Dre helped introduced Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" by saying the intro \"I see dead people,\" and the crowd exploded.\n\nLamar ran through \"Not Like Us\" a total of five times -- not including a sixth time which was just the instrumental -- and paused at the unforgettable lyric \"A minorrrrrrrrrrr,\" which he and the audience held for an extended period of time. (This moment felt like Lamar's version of Kanye and Jay-Z's \"N -- in Paris\" or Beyonc\u00e9's mute challenge.)\n\nOf the more than a dozen performers, it was most surprising that Lamar's cousin and label mate, Baby Keem, didn't make a guest appearance at the show.\n\nAlthough \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" was undoubtedly a final victory lap for Lamar, he made it clear throughout that this event was much bigger than him or any rap beef. It's always been about elevating the culture, unifying people and putting on for his city -- and that will never change.\n\nIn the parking lot many audience members said they saw the show as a historic moment, not only for music but also for the celebration of hip-hop and Black L.A.\n\n\"It's a cultural moment,\" Stacy Aneke, 25, of Ontario, adding that he wanted to celebrate with the \"winning team,\" referring to Kendrick of course.\n\n\"There's nobody honestly better than Lamar to bring out the community who actually know the history and purpose of Juneteenth and to get people more aware of Juneteenth and its importance,\" fan Omarri Veck, 24 said.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The show, which aired on Amazon Prime and, was referred to by many fans as \"Hatechella.\"\n\nKendrick opened up the set by playing his Drake diss track, \"Euphoria.\" For his first time performing the song, fans immediately got the sense that the Ken & Friends celebration would feature more heat toward Drake. Kendrick even added some new lines to the track with \"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I might give you new respect.\"\n\nThe sold-out concert had the crowd rapping word-for-word with Kendrick, especially the line where he asks, \"What is it, the braids?!\" Reacting to his opening track, fans went wild on social media. One person wrote on X (formerly Twitter), \"KENDRICK OPENING UP WITH PERFORMING EUPHORIA FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH EVERY ONE SINGING ALONG. THIS IS LEGENDARY S -- [sobbing emoji].\" Added another, \"Kendrick Lamar opening up with Euphoria going down in history.\" A third said, \"He ain't ever coming up off Drake's neck.\" Wrote a fourth user, \"Opening with Euphoria is dastardly.\"\n\n\"It's only right that we start from day one, you know? So where would we be without our legacies,\" Kendrick asked the crowd. Dr. Dre came up on the stage to \"Still Dre\" with Kendrick rapping Snoop Dogg's part and then performed \"California Love.\" Before he leaves, Kendrick asks Dre if he's going to \"sing\" something. A little shy at first, Dre crouches and whispers, \"I see dead people.\"\n\nThis is when things get wild, as Kendrick performs \"Not Like Us\" another time after telling the crowd at the end of the first time, \"So you're not gonna let nobody disrespect the west coast\" or \"imitate our legends, huh?\" Playing \"Not Like Us\" for the third time, the crowd chants \"OV-Hoe.\" This time, the rapper is joined by two backup dancers. For his fourth consecutive play of \"Not Like Us,\" he brought out DJ Mustard. Hilariously, K-Dot started to forget his lyrics and even laughed, asking, \"What comes after that?\"\n\nFans loved the commitment online, with one person saying, \"Ken & Friends is a Hall of Fame hate sesh & it'll never be dethroned.\" Another hilariously wrote, \"My a- just started crip walkin' to 'Not Like Us' on Ken & Friends, and I don't even know how!

With E-40 providing the intro (and later interlude) monologue, DJ Hed's opening set featured young rap talent like Wallie The Sensei, Zoe Osama, Kalan.FrFr, Remble and others. Mustard's more mainstream set had rousing performances from Tyler, The Creator, YG, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy and many more.\n\nThen it was Kendrick's time to shine. He began his set with \"Euphoria\" before rolling into more hits. The rapper's time on stage featured a Black Hippy reunion with Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q reuniting onstage. Legendary producer Dr. Dre even popped out toward the end and performed before introducing Kendrick's chart-topping Drake diss track \"Not Like Us,\" which Kendrick went on to perform five times. The show concluded with a large group photo of everyone who participated in the show, followed by one last performance of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\n\"This sh*t make me proud then a muthaf**ka, y'all don't know. This sh*t get me emotional, dawg,\" Kendrick stated while posing the mass picture. \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music sh*t, a lot of homies to the street sh*t. For all of us to be on stage together, unity, from each side of muthaf*kin' L.A. Crips, Bloods, Pirus, that sh*t is special, man.\"\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nSee the best moments from Kendrick Lamar's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends concert below.\n\nAs fans poured into the Kia Forum in Los Angeles for The Pop Out - Ken & Friends Concert, photos began to emerge online of K-Dot fans wearing a lot of their own merch. One of the most memorable photos shows a group of four kids, each with a different line from Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" on their T-shirt.\n\nThe front of their shirts together read: \"They Not Like Us.\" The back of their shirts read: \"Dot F*ck Em Up.\"\n\nThe Pop Out - Ken & Friends Concert was narrated by E-40, another lovely West Coast touch that was celebrated by the crowd when his voice came over the loudspeakers.\n\n\"Tonight is a celebration of what makes the left coast the best coast... and the unification of the west,\" he said before Kendrick's set as the crowd cheered.\n\nE-40 spoke about the moment a little bit more on his Instagram. He said he went right to the hotel after landing in Washington, D.C. to record his narrations, and that he always knew Kendrick Lamar was \"gonna be special.\"\n\nBefore Kendrick took the stage, The Pop Out event made sure to highlight a ton of the new talent coming out of the West Coast. Remble, Ray Vaughn, Cuzzos, OhGeesy and Fenix Flexin, BlueBucksClan and Westside Boogie were just a few of the young rappers who popped out to get the crowd ready for K-Dot.\n\nThe legendary krump dancer Tommy the Clown and a large crew of dancers also broke it down with a lengthy dance battle before closing out DJ Hed's set.\n\nMustard spent a good portion of his set reminding the audience just how prominent of a hitmaker he is. Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" serves as Mustard's first hit in a few years, and Mustard capitalized on his moment by performing almost like Verzuz set to show the audience how much his sound defined the 2010s. He ran through Tyga's \"Rack City,\" 2 Chainz' \"I'm Different,\" Kid Ink's \"Show Me\" with Chris Brown, Big Sean's \"I Dont F**k With You\" and other smashes. He then got the crowd even more excited by bringing out Tyler, The Creator, his close friends YG and Roddy Ricch to remind fans even more of his dominance.\n\n\"Aye Mustard,\" Roddy said at one point. \"They tryna say we fell off!\"\n\nTyler, The Creator popped out during Mustard's set and did a killer run-through of \"Wusyaname\" and \"Earfquake,\" and the latter had the crowd going absolutely bonkers. Clips from the Amazon stream show the crowd carrying the song, as they screamed out the chorus while Ty did laps around the Kia Forum stage.\n\nTyler ended things on a polite note, giving the crowd a simple \"thank you\" before bowing and departing.\n\nKendrick Lamar began his Pop Out Concert by performing his Drake diss track \"Euphoria.\" During the energized run-through of the lyrical diss, Kendrick threw in a new bar just to throw salt in Drake's wound.\n\nKendrick rapped, \"I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man?/'Cause I ain't see him yet/Give me Tupac ring back and I might give you a lil' respect.\"\n\nThe lyrics on the recorded version of the song are: \"I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man?/'Cause I ain't see him yet/Matter of fact I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him?\"\n\nKendrick Lamar also reunited with the Black Hippy crew at The Pop Out - Ken & Friends concert. For the first time in years, Kendrick was seen partying it up with Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q in that order to perform.\n\nJay Rock performed \"WIN,\" while Ab-Soul hopped on stage to hype K-Dot up as he ran through his Drake diss track \"6:16 in LA.\" ScHoolboy Q then came running on stage to perform \"Collard Greens\" and \"THat Part.\" At the end of the show, Black Hippy then came together on stage so Kendrick could run through his hit single \"Not Like Us\" one last time before closing out the show.\n\nKendrick Lamar's outfit became the talk of the internet during his performance. Fans quickly pieced together that K-Dot was likely paying homage to Tupac Shakur and his all-red outfit from his infamous appearance at the Source Awards.\n\nThe 1995 Source Awards came as growing tensions between the East and West Coast were at an all-time high, with Pac infamously ambushing A Tribe Called Quest's acceptance speech for Best Group to perform \"Out on Bail.\"\n\nKendrick's red ensemble also included a $600,000 cross-chain, similar to the one 'Pac wore at said awards, but much more brolic. The cross was designed by jeweler Ben Baller, who celebrated the moment on X by reminding people there's \"nobody better,\" and that K-Dot \"knew who to call\" for some ice.\n\nDr. Dre shocked the Kia Forum when he came out as a surprise guest during Kendrick's set. Together he and K-Dot performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before the super producer introduced the song everyone was dying to hear.\n\n\"You ain't gonna say nothing else before we continue to party?\" K-Dot asked as Dre appeared to be wandering off the stage.\n\n\"Yeah, OK,\" Dre said. He then walked a few steps and leaned into the microphone. \"I'm gonna take a moment of silence for this one. Psst I see dead people.\"\n\nDuring one of the most memorable moments of the night, Kendrick Lamar closed out his epic Pop Out show by performing \"Not Like Us\" a whopping five times, marking the first time he's ever performed the song live. After doing the first four run-throughs completely on his own, he invited all of the show's performers, as well as dozens of celebrities on stage to vibe out to the Drake diss track one last time.\n\nThe L.A. vs. Everybody vibes were thick enough to cut with a knife. The entire lineup was filled up with artists from the L.A. area. Artists from different eras, sets, and neighborhoods graced the stage, going back to Dr. Dre all the way up to 301Babii.\n\nSeveral non-rap celebs were reportedly in attendance including actors Don Cheadle, John Boyega, singer Chl\u00f6e Bailey and others. NBA players DeMar Derozen and Russell Westbrook, both Cali natives, even danced on stage during one of the final performances of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nK-Dot's fianc\u00e9e Whitney Alford was present and accounted for at the show along with their two kids. After Drake claimed on his \"Family Matters\" diss song that K-Dot had abused Alford, there was speculation that her relationship with Kendrick was over. However, her presence at the show along with their kids appears to speak volumes.\n\nSocial media had a field day with posts about the concert, with much of the comic relief being gang-related since K-Dot was able to peacefully gather different sets under one roof.\n\n\"Can't believe Drake tried to say this man was not affiliated. They having a Blood Bonvention on the stage right now,\" one hilarious post reads.\n\nKendrick Lamar closed out the show with a show of unity in the form of a group photo on stage with everyone who participated in the event.\n\n\"This sh*t make me proud then a muthaf**ka, y'all don't know. This sh*t get me emotional, dawg,\" Kendrick stated while posing the mass picture. \"We done lost a lot of homes to this music sh*t, a lot of homies to the street sh*t.

Some of the people on stage included DJ Mustard (who produced the record), Black Hippy (Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q), Compton rapper YG, L.A. Clipper Russell Westbrook, singer Steve Lacy, radio host Big Boy, Tommy the Clown (along his talented crew of child krumpers), choreographer Charm La'Donna and allegedly members of every gang in L.A.\n\n\"This s -- t gets me emotional,\" Lamar said. \"We done lost a lot a lot of homies to this music s -- t. A lot of homies to some street s -- t and for all of us to be on this stage together; unity from each side of motherf -- king L.A., crips, bloods, pirus -- this s -- t is special man.\"\n\nHe added, \"We put this s -- t together just for y'all.\"\n\nLamar announced his \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" show, which was produced with his label/creative agency pgLang and Free Lunch on June 5, just days after organizers of the annual Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival in South L.A. -- where thousands of Black Angelenos have been congregating on the special holiday for several years -- announced that it was canceled due to costs and safety concerns. The historic performance also came roughly a month after Lamar's vicious rap beef with Drake in which he was deemed the winner by Internet scorekeepers.\n\nReal 92.3's DJ Hed was first to take the stage around 4:20 p.m., bringing out a number of guest performers including Kalan.FrFr, Westside Boogie and Cuzzos (a girl rap group) and Tommy the Clown along with his group of krumping, child dancers.\n\nNext up was Grammy-winning producer, DJ Mustard, who also welcomed several of his collaborators and friends to the stage including Blxst, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Roddy Ricch, recent high school graduate 310Babii, and Tyler, the Creator. He also made a dedication to late rapper, Nipsey Hussle, during his DJ set.\n\nThroughout the intermissions between sets, the crowd chanted the lyric \"OVHOE,\" one of the catchiest in a long line of memorable lines at the end of \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nFollowing a recorded introduction from rapper E-40, Lamar emerged from the stage and opened his set with his Drake diss track, \"Euphoria,\" as a bright red light shined on him. His hawk-eyed fans wasted no time to post on social media that he'd added a new bar to the song: \"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nLamar went onto performing some of his older tracks including \"DNA,\" \"Element\" and \"Alright,\" all of which carried a different weight following the Drake beef. But one of the best moments during the show was undoubtedly when Lamar reunited with Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul on stage to perform \"King's Dead.\"\n\nAfter Lamar performed his verse from Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" he brought out Dr. Dre -- his longtime mentor and collaborator -- to perform his classic hits \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love.\" Before he left the stage, Dre helped introduced Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" by saying the intro \"I see dead people,\" and the crowd exploded.\n\nLamar ran through \"Not Like Us\" a total of five times -- not including a sixth time which was just the instrumental -- and paused at the unforgettable lyric \"A minorrrrrrrrrrr,\" which he and the audience held for an extended period of time. (This moment felt like Lamar's version of Kanye and Jay-Z's \"N -- as in Paris\" or Beyonc\u00e9's mute challenge.)\n\nOf the more than dozen performers, it was most surprising that Lamar's cousin and label mate, Baby Keem, didn't make a guest appearance at the show.\n\nAlthough \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" show was undoubtedly a final victory lap for Lamar, he made it clear throughout that this event was much bigger than him or any rap beef. It's always been about elevating the culture, unifying people and putting on for his city -- and that will never change.\n\nIn the parking lot many audience members saw the show as a historic moment not only for music but for the celebration of hip hop and Black LA.\n\n\"It's a cultural moment,\" Stacy Aneke, 25, of Ontario, adding that he wanted to celebrate with the \"winning team,\" referring to Kendrick of course.\n\n\"There's nobody honestly better than Lamar to bring out the community who actually know the history and purpose of Juneteenth and to get people more aware of Juneteenth and its importance,\" fan Omarri Veck, 24 said.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That is, except for one thing: Last night, Kendrick Lamar hosted The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends, a special concert event that wasn't about the Drake feud, but was also totally about the Drake feud. A number of Lamar's Drake diss tracks made the setlist, most notably \"Not Like Us,\" which was performed five times in a row to end the show.\n\nFolks online took notice: Drake became the No. 1 trending topic on X (formerly Twitter) and still is as of this post on Thursday morning.\n\nA lot of the reactions were people imagining Drake's reaction to the show, particularly to the repetition of \"Not Like Us,\" with tweets comedically imagining Drake feeling anger, frustration, or sadness.\n\nOthers just admired the whole situation. As one user put it, \"17,000+ people gathered together in one place to call Drake a pedophile with Kendrick Lamar. This level of hate will never be duplicated.\" Another noted, \"Not Like Us to Drake is how Back To Back was for Meek [crying laughing emoji] Kendrick preformed the song 4 times and the entire arena rapped it word for word all 4 times", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Wordplay", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Drake-Getty-Images-2024-710x400-1.jpeg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 22, "textEnd": 29}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Not content with merely taking a victory lap after winning his battle against fellow rap superstar Drake, Kendrick Lamar turned his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert at the Forum into a cathartic livestreamed celebration of Los Angeles unity.\n\nLamar curated a three-hour concert featuring a mix of up-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. When it was his turn to take the stage, the 37-year-old rapper powered through a set with Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, performed his Drake diss songs \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA,\" then was joined on-stage by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe two West Coast titans performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before Dre quieted the roaring crowd by calling for a moment of silence. It was a misdirect. He then delivered the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens Lamar's chart-topping \"Not Like Us\": \"I see dead people.\"\n\nA crowd of 17,000 that included The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross rapped along to every word of the biting-but-jubilant DJ Mustard production, which Lamar restarted twice after the first verse and performed four times in full.\n\nShuffling, frolicking, dancing and spinning around him as Lamar strode the stage in a red hoodie: NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, Mustard, rapper Roddy Ricch and even a teenage dance troupe led by the krumping innovator Tommy the Clown.\n\nLamar reveled in the moment: \"Y'all ain't gon' let nobody disrespect the West Coast. Y'all ain't gon' let nobody imitate our legends, huh,\" he said, referring to Drake's use of an AI tool to mimic 2Pac's voice on one of his diss records.\n\nBut Lamar had more on his mind, calling out to specific men and women to join him on-stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru -- this ... is special, man. We put this ... together just for ya'll.\n\n\"This ... ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nAfter the final song, Lamar exited, saying \"I promise you this won't be the last of us.\" The stabbing horns of the \"Not Like Us\" instrumental kicked in once again and the crowd rapped the lyrics without Lamar as they filed through hallways out to the parking lot.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

During the performance of \"euphoria,\" Kendrick, 37, revealed some new lyrics, referencing a ring that Tupac Shakur owned that Drake, 37, bought in an auction. The \"DNA\" rapper once again took a shot at Drizzy to show that he doesn't really have any respect for him.\n\nDuring Kendrick's explosive intro, he kicked off the show with the first-ever performance of \"euphoria.\" The track already had a reference to Drake buying a ring that had once belonged to Tupac, but Kendrick added a new line in the middle. \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect,\" he rapped at one point.\n\nEarly on in the beef, Drake had referenced Kendrick's admiration for 2pac, even using an AI-generated voice filter to make himself sound like the late rapper on \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" which was eventually taken down after Tupac's estate threatened legal action. Kendrick referenced the ring on the original version of \"euphoria.\" He rapped, \"Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage/I'd rather do that than let a Canadian n***a make Pac turn in his grave.\"\n\nBesides \"euphoria,\" Kendrick also performed the diss track \"6:16 in LA\" for the first time with Ab-Soul, as well as \"Like That.\" He also welcomed other collaborators like Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q, and perhaps most notably, Dr. Dre to the stage. After performing some of Dre's biggest hits, the N.W.A. alum stayed on stage to perform \"Not Like Us\" with Kendrick for the first time. The rapper closed out the show by performing the Drake diss, which has hit no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, five times in a row, with a few guests joining him along the way.\n\nDrake and Kendrick's beef has mostly cooled in the month since \"Not Like Us\" dropped. Even though many fans had declared K.Dot the winner of the rap battle, Drake had last dropped a diss track, called \"The Heart Part 6\" back in May.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "N.W.A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kendrick-lamar-new-lyrics-euphoria-ftr.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 156, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

While Drake tried his best in his feud with Kenny he fell short, it is what it is.\n\nAccording to Billboard Kendrick's victory lap will be his Juneteenth concert 'The Pop Out: Ken & Friends'. The show will be live-streamed from The Forum in Los Angeles and will begin at 4 PT.\n\nThe show will start on time and will feature three separate sets including DJ Hed & Friends, DJ Mustard & Friends, and lastly Ken & Friends.

However, even without any new music \"Not Like Us\" and \"Euphoria\" for the first time will be a moment.\n\nThe undeniable song of the summer live in the city it was hand-crafted to be played in might cause pandemonium down the entire West Coast.

It felt like it was one of the biggest \"live streaming events\" in a long time, perhaps the biggest ever, if we're talking about cultural impact. People are going to be talking about all of this for a long time, not just The Pop Out, but Kendrick's whole energy over the past eight weeks or so. The Pop Out is already being colloquially referred to as Gangchella - because there were so many gang-affiliated performers there - but I will remember it as both the Super Bowl for Haters AND a wonderful, important moment for LA culture and California rap.\n\nThe first hour of the show was Kendrick highlighting lesser-known LA artists, who all got to perform for a few minutes all in a row. Then DJ Mustard got an hour-long set, with guest appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy and YG. One of the biggest surprises of the night was Tyler the Creator popping out for about two minutes to do a medley of \"WUSYANAME\" and \"Earfquake\" to a rapturous reception. Mustard also paid homage to Nipsey Hussle. It was all really cool and people loved all of it.\n\nThen Kendrick gave himself the \"third hour.\" He OPENED with \"Euphoria,\" which was his big Drake-response song after Drake had spent weeks whining and crying about how Kendrick wouldn't battle-rap with him. Kendrick's setlist was so good - I would have loved to hear him perform \"Meet the Grahams,\" but I understand that it is probably much too dark for a celebration of LA's music scene. Some songs in his setlist: DNA, Money Trees, Humble, Maad City, Alright, King Kunta, Swimming Pools and more. Then... he brought out Dr. Dre. Just in case you thought that the OGs of the LA scene didn't 100% approve of all things Kendrick Lamar. Dre and Kendrick performed \"Still Dre\" and \"California Love.\"\n\nJust as Dre was about to leave the stage, Kendrick called him back and Dre did the \"pssss... I see dead people\" line, and Kendrick started \"Not Like Us.\" \"Not Like Us\" is the last song Kendrick released in the \"battle rap\" and it's the one which completely ended Drake. Kendrick is not only the certified boogeyman, he's the certified hater. Kendrick performed \"Not Like Us\" SIX TIMES. In a row. With pyrotechnics. I hope Drake gets it now. I hope he understands that Kendrick has always hated him and that everyone is on Kendrick's side.

At the concert, he performed his Billboard-charting Drake diss \"Not Like Us\" five times in a row.\n\nThousands rapped along as Lamar spit his fiery verses onstage at the star-studded affair, which was live-streamed on Amazon. The concert event also included guests Tyler, the Creator and YG. NBA stars Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, as well as singer The Weeknd, were in the crowd as Lamar brought dozens of rival gang members onstage.\n\n\"This shit gets me emotional, dog,\" he told the crowd. \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, lot of homies to some street shit, and for all of us to be on this stage together; unity from each side of motherfucking L.A., crips, bloods, pirus -- this shit is special, man.\n\nThe beef between the two hip-hip titans kicked off in March when the rappers directly engaged each other on wax after years of subtle shots. Lamar fans would note that his \"Not Like Us\" is already hip-hop's unofficial summer anthem.\n\nThe concert attracted about 17,000 attendees. One social media user wrote on X, formerly Twitter, \"This Kendrick show is the blueprint for a hometown event.\"\n\nLamar apparently named the show after his espoused ethos on \"Not Like Us\" that \"you gotta pop out\" to squash the competition sometimes. He gave 15 relatively unknown local acts the stage to open for him.\n\nLamar held the concert on Juneteenth in commemoration of the last enslaved people in the U.S. being liberated in 1865 -- after Drake accused him in a diss of \"always rapping like you bout to get the slaves freed.\" Lamar took a moment onstage to address Drake, saying, \"Give me Tupac's ring back.\"\n\nThe Canadian rapper

Was it when 17,000 people rapped the lyrics to a six and half minute diss track? Was it the third, fourth or fifth time Kendrick Lamar dropped \"Not Like Us\" to close the show? Either way, what we all witnessed was one man bringing out all his friends to enthusiastically dance on another man's grave.\n\nThroughout the Compton native's set, viewers had a good time getting their jokes off about how he put on a whole concert just to kick more dirt in Drake's face. And Black Twitter made sure the Certified Lover Boy knew exactly what was going on at the KIA Forum in Inglewood.\n\nAcknowledging the unique circumstances that led us here, one user wrote on X, \"17,000+ people gathered together in one place to call Drake a pedophile with Kendrick Lamar. This level of hate will never be duplicated.\"\n\nOne person noted how Ken came out the gate on fire, writing on X, \"Kendrick Lamar kicked off his 'Ken & Friends' Juneteenth concert with 'Euphoria' He ain't ever coming up off Drake's neck.\"\n\nSeveral fans showed their appreciation for the Grammy winner's commitment to his grudge, with one user posting, \"Kendrick definitely extremely petty.\"\n\nIf this were just about putting one over on Drake, people wouldn't have been as enthusiastic. Ken's artistry is what makes this moment so special, prompting one person to post, \"NAHH THIS IS ONE THE GREATEST HIPHOP PERFORMANCES OF ALL TIME!!!!\"\n\n\"Kendrick Lamar Presents: I Hate Drake The Musical Sponsored by Amazon Music,\" wrote another user about the production.\n\nAt one point, when \"Not Like Us\" dropped for the fourth or fifth time, with the crowd not missing a single lyric, one person noted, \"THEY JUMPIN DRAKE DAMN!\"\n\nWith his rival going full \"Mortal Kombat\" to \"Finish Him,\" someone offered the Canadian superstar travel advice, writing on X, \"Drake can't even fly over California at this rate.\"\n\n\"Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers\" led to a lot of questions about the \"DNA\" rapper's artistic choices, but he put all that to rest with this performance. \"I don't wanna hear anyone say shit about Kendrick AGAIN! An absolute LEGEND,\" wrote one user on X.\n\nIt was painfully clear what we were all watching, with one person writing, on X, \"I ain't never been to a funeral this lit in my life! Wild! Streaming your ops demise is crazy work.\"\n\nOne of the most important moments of the night came when Kendrick got members of all the local gangs on stage together for a photo of unity. This is how you use art to positively impact your city. Of course, it was back to regularly scheduled programming when he was done with that. \"Bruh organized a group photo op and then continued to dance on his grave,\" wrote \"Grapsody\" podcast host Phil Lindsey.\n\nOne person wondered if the Toronto native has tried to fix things with K.Dot, asking on X, \"have you tried apologizing @Drake?\"\n\nAnother user pointed out how the concert displayed the fundamental differences between the two artists, writing on X, \"that's what made tonight special. i know we love the drake hate but kendrick made sure it was a tribute to his home and her people. he said it was bigger than back and forth records. drake would've made it about drake.\"\n\nAll joking aside, Kendrick didn't just take a victory lap for himself, he did it for LA, turning the concert into a moment of peace and love for everyone.", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The creator of the \"Not Like Us\" beat brought out a star-studded lineup featuring 310babii, Blxst, Ty Dolla $, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler The Creator, YG, and Roddy Rich.\n\nHe also took a moment to pay tribute to the late great Nipsey Hussle which the West Coast crowd truly appreciated.\n\nThe best part of Mustard raising the energy was Kendrick coming out immediately afterward to blow the roof off The Forum. Kendrick didn't waste any time and opened his set with his Drake diss \"Euphoria.\"\n\nThe entire setlist seemingly was every song the Compton rapper subbed Drake on dating back almost a decade. When King Kenny spoke to the crowd and people streaming at home, he reminded them Los Angeles lost Nipsey Hussle and then lost Kobe Bryant. The city has been hurting and needed a reason to unite and he delivered it wonderfully.\n\nAfter reuniting with his TDE brothers Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, and Jay Rock onstage, Kendrick performed his \"6:16 In LA\" Drake diss before brining out Westcoast legend Dr. Dre to join the celebration.\n\nDr. Dre performed \"Still D.R.E\" and \"California Love\" before ushering in the moment the crowd was waiting for.\n\nDr. Dre kicked off Kendirck's first-ever performance of \"Not Like Us\" by calling for a moment of silence before reciting the iconic opening line, \"I see dead people.\"\n\nNot only did Kendrick perform the diss for the first time, he did it at least six times which is a fitting amount of times to diss Drake a.k.a. the \"6 God.\"\n\nDuring the show's finale, Kendrick celebrated the unity that Los Angeles showed on Juneteenth. Gang members from every set with a deep history of decades-long beef came together and Kendrick made sure to celebrate the moment.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Meanwhile, Kendrick Lamar's fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Alford, was in attendance after Drake's diss records cast aspersions on her relationship with his rival. If anyone was wondering whether Kendrick and Whitney are still together after all the hoopla generated by Drake's diss tracks, this may not be the definitive answer they were looking for, but it seems to prove they're still on good terms, if nothing else. (They'd have to be, they have two kids together.)\n\nMeanwhile, the list of those celebrities who \"popped out\" at last night's concert is extensive and appears to include many of those who Drake would have considered homies before.

Known for his lyrical prowess and occasional jabs at fellow artists, Lamar took the opportunity to escalate his ongoing feud with Drake.\n\nKendrick Lamar's Latest Diss at The Pop Out Concert\n\nDuring the concert, Lamar altered the lyrics of \"Euphoria,\" inserting a pointed reference aimed directly at Drake. He rapped, \"I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man?/'Cause I ain't see him yet/Give me Tupac ring back and I might give you a lil' respect.\" This modification not only reiterated his disdain but also hinted at a desire for Drake to return a ring once owned by Tupac Shakur, which Drake had purchased at auction.\n\nThe contentious lyric change stems from a longstanding rivalry between the two rappers, marked by public exchanges and occasional diss tracks. In previous instances, Lamar has criticized Drake for various reasons, including using AI-generated Tupac vocals on a track and engaging in perceived cultural appropriation.\n\nThe Ongoing Kendrick Lamar-Drake Feud\n\nThe Kendrick Lamar-Drake feud has been a subject of fascination among fans and media alike. It dates back to various incidents, including subtle lyrical jabs and public statements from both artists. Lamar's decision to tweak \"Euphoria\" during his recent concert underscores the persistence of their rivalry despite occasional periods of relative calm.\n\nDrake, who is known for his chart-topping hits and widespread popularity, has not shied away from the conflict either. While the feud has not reached the heights of some past rap rivalries, it continues to capture attention whenever new developments arise. Drake's response to Lamar's latest jab remains to be seen, but given the history between the two, it's likely that the saga will continue to unfold in the public eye.\n\nThe Pop-Out Concert itself was a showcase of Lamar's musical talent, featuring guest appearances from industry heavyweights like Dr. Dre, Tyler, the Creator, and Schoolboy Q. The event, streamed live on Prime Video and Amazon Music's Twitch channel, drew significant viewership and highlighted Kendrick Lamar's enduring influence in the hip-hop community.\n\nAs fans dissect Lamar's latest lyrics and await potential responses, the feud serves as a reminder of the competitive nature of the music industry and the power of artistic expression in shaping cultural dialogue. Whether this latest chapter in the Lamar-Drake saga leads to reconciliation or further escalation remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: their ongoing rivalry continues to fascinate and captivate audiences worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural appropriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guest appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kendrick-Lamar-offers-Drake-remorse-in-new-lyric-at-Pop-Out-show.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Log in.\n\nAfter the pair released a series of back-to-back diss tracks in April and May, Lamar was viewed as the winner after \"Not Like Us\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 charts for one week in May and has been in the top 10 ever since. Drake's response, \"The Heart Part 6\" wasn't enough to beat Lamar.\n\nWhen both artists went quiet, fans were left wondering what would happen next.\n\nLamar didn't disappoint with \"The Pop Out,\" where he performed four of his five Drake diss tracks, opening with \"Euphoria.\" Later came his diss verses on \"6:16\" and \"Like That,\" and he ended the night with \"Not Like Us,\" featuring an intro from West Coast hip-hop legend Dr Dre, who joined him on stage.\n\nLamar then performed \"Not Like Us\" four more times alongside numerous West Coast rappers, athletes, dancers, and members from multiple Los Angeles gangs. At the end, they took a group photo together.\n\nFans said the concert was the equivalent of Lamar getting the West Coast to dance on Drake's grave, and proof that the hip-hop community supports him.\n\nBut they also appreciated the cultural significance of the show, with one X user describing it as \"one of the most historic nights in hip-hop history.\"\n\nWhile fans have focused a lot on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual assault, pedophilia, and domestic abuse in the pair's diss tracks, the battle was truly about authenticity.\n\nIn \"Not Like Us,\" Lamar calls Drake, who is Canadian, a \"colonizer\" of rap culture, claiming he stole his persona from artists like Future, Lil Baby, 21 Savage, Young Thug, Quavo, and 2Chainz.\n\nIn \"Family Matters\" and \"Push Ups,\" Drake calls Lamar, who raps about race and societal issues, a fake activist and says his hometown, Compton, California, doesn't support him.\n\nLamar challenged that idea by showcasing up-and-coming West Coast rappers and performing with major Californian hip-hop stars including Tyler The Creator, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, and Dr. Dre, while the crowd was filled with stars including LeBron James.\n\nLamar didn't just bring all of these artists together to mock Drake, though, but to unite the West Coast.\n\n\"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side mother-fucking LA, Crips, Bloods, Pirus, this shit is special, man. We put this shit together just for ya'll,\" Lamar said in between the \"Not Like Us\" encores, referring to rival gang members onstage.\n\n\"This shit ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this shit was about, to bring all of us to-mother-fucking-gether,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayomikun_adekaiyero@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ayomikun Adekaiyero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Baby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lil Baby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "21 Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Chainz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2 Chainz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Thug", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Young Thug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quavo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quavo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66743e6a087acd2be9b5095c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Lamar invited every artist who performed at the show onstage and instructed them to say, \"One West!\" The DNA rapper said, \"This is unity, y'all just don't know man.\" \"Everybody got fallen sons but we're right here, right now celebrating all of them, this s**t is special,\" he added.\n\nThe event opened with sets by DJ Hed and DJ Mustard, who held a moment in memory of slain LA rapper Nipsey Hussle. Other performers at the glitzy event included Tyler, the Creator, YG, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, and Dr. Dre. Meanwhile, Lamar himself took the stage with the performance of Euphoria -- another diss track aimed at Drake.\n\nLast month, Lamar put an end to the years-long feud with the God's Plan rapper with the release of Not Like Us. In the explosive track, the Pray For Me crooner accused Drake of \"colonising\" Southern rap culture for personal gain among other claims, which the Canadian artist has denied. Given the popular demand, Lamar performed the track five times at The Pop Out.\n\nAs the set drew to a close, he asked the audience, \"Y'all ain't gonna let nobody disrespect the West Coast, huh?\" Lamar went on to criticise Drake's use of AI versions of Tupac and Snoop Dogg's vocals on his song, Taylor Made Freestyle, saying, \"Oh y'all ain't gonna let nobody mock or imitate our legends, huh?\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Lacy_(saxophonist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Lacy (saxophonist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dom Kennedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipsey_Hussle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nipsey Hussle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Dolla_Sign", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Dolla Sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God's_Plan_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God's Plan (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Collectives", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Collectives", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Installations_and_Performances", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Digital/Installations and Performances", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/20/1600x900/files-us-entertainment-music-award-grammy_223a0326-fad6-11e8-9d17-a8cab32bfcb1_1718886762503.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Not content with merely taking a victory lap after winning his battle against fellow rap superstar Drake, Kendrick Lamar turned his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert at the Forum into a cathartic livestreamed celebration of Los Angeles unity.\n\nLamar curated a three-hour concert featuring a mix of up-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. When it was his turn to take the stage, the 37-year-old rapper powered through a set with Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, performed his Drake diss songs \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA,\" then was joined on-stage by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe two West Coast titans performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before Dre quieted the roaring crowd by calling for a moment of silence. It was a misdirect. He then delivered the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens Lamar's chart-topping \"Not Like Us\": \"I see dead people.\"\n\nA crowd of 17,000 that included The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross rapped along to every word of the biting-but-jubilant DJ Mustard production, which Lamar restarted twice after the first verse and performed four times in full.\n\nShuffling, frolicking, dancing and spinning around him as Lamar strode the stage in a red hoodie: NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, Mustard, rapper Roddy Ricch and even a teenage dance troupe led by the krumping innovator Tommy the Clown.\n\nLamar reveled in the moment: \"Y'all ain't gon' let nobody disrespect the West Coast. Y'all ain't gon' let nobody imitate our legends, huh,\" he said, referring to Drake's use of an AI tool to mimic 2Pac's voice on one of his diss records.\n\nBut Lamar had more on his mind, calling out to specific men and women to join him on-stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru -- this ... is special, man. We put this ... together just for ya'll.\n\n\"This ... ain't got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nAfter the final song, Lamar exited, saying \"I promise you this won't be the last of us.\" The stabbing horns of the \"Not Like Us\" instrumental kicked in once again and the crowd rapped the lyrics without Lamar as they filed through hallways out to the parking lot.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Dot was referring to is a pricey piece of jewelry that Drake purchased for north of $1 million at an auction in 2023. The trinket is said to have been worn on Pac's left ring finger when he made his last public appearance on Sept 4, 1996, at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe rap legend would be shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting just three days later, ultimately succumbig to his injuries.\n\nLamar's inclusion of \"Euphoria\" into his show was just one instance during The Pop Out that saw the wordsmith add insult to injury in his attack of Drake.\n\nGathering an extensive list of West Coast luminaries to share the stage with him throughout the evening, Kendrick entertained the crowd with his chart-topping Drake diss \"Not Like Us\" not once, but 6 times over, an indication that he's yet to fully disengage despite Drizzy seemingly waving the white flag last month.\n\nIn addition to calling for Shakur's ring to be returned, Kendrick channeled his spirit while teaming up with Dr. Dre for a performance of Pac's 1996 single, \"California Love.\" With Lamar filling in for Pac and reciting the late icon's verse on the track, the moment was one of many that spoke to his influence and enduring legacy.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preezy_brown@vibe.com", "name": "Preezy Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MTV Video Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_(Crazy_Town_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly (Crazy Town song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drive-by shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Body", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Body", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2Pac-Lamar.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1996-09-04", "textStart": 958, "textEnd": 970}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Some of them showed up to express their support for one of the hottest stars right now, Kendrick Lamar. Who exactly was there at 'The Pop Out'? It was LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and many more.\n\nIt has been a while since Kendrick Lamar had a public performance. After his Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers tour, everything became relatively quiet for the icon out of Compton. This held true until he lashed back at Drake by being featured on Like That by Future and Metro Boomin. Since then, he went track-for-track against the renowned Toronto Raptors fan. He released hits like Euphoria, Meet the Grahams, and Not Like Us.\n\nEach of these songs was played by Kendrick Lamar. It had everyone bopping and singing, including LeBron James. The Los Angeles Lakers legend and four-time NBA champion was very near the stage. Notably, he and Stephen Curry were namedropped in 'Meet the Grahams'. Lamar told the two to keep their families away from Drake due to the allegations surrounding the rapper from Toronto.\n\nAnother NBA legend who was at 'The Pop Out' was James Harden. The Los Angeles Clippers guard and 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player hung out with Rick Ross. They were also relatively close to the stage and towered over everyone during the show. More importantly, these two were very hyped to hear Lamar perform his diss tracks and even got to see Dr. Dre say the iconic lines to start off 'Not Like Us'.\n\nKendrick Lamar brings out NBA legends from Los Angeles\n\nPerhaps the pair who had the most fun during KDot's concert were DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook. These two Los Angeles natives got invited to go on stage with Lamar. The former college stars out of USC and UCLA got to dance around to the tune of 'Not Like Us'.\n\nWhen these two West Coast legends got up there with KDot, fans went absolutely feral.\n\nKendrick Lamar bringing out Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan and the whole west coast on stage while performing Not Like Us at The Pop Out Concert. A Moment In History #ThePopOut\n\nRussell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan being on this stage got me HOWLING\n\nDEROZAN & WESTBROOK ON STAGE BROOOO!!!! WHOLE GANG ON STAGE!!!! KEN & FRIENDS!!!\n\nSome were even recalling the beef. They marveled at how star-studded Lamar's fans were and how they supported him.\n\nDrake gonna f*** around and diss Russell Westbrook, Demar Derozan, Amazon, YG, Schoolboy Q, collard greens, sweet peas, green beans, Jay Rock, The Rock, Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago Bulls, Universoul Circus, and everybody else\n\nKDot surely brought out the Avengers of current West Coast basketball. This just proves how great the ties are between rap and the current state of the game. Hopefully, it will continue to grow and leave a positive influence on everyone around the culture.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

Of course, it served as a final nail in the coffin in his Drake beef, but folks will likely remember the show throughout history for much more heartening reasons. One of these is the massive heap of West Coast artists that came out to perform, and the other was how moving it was to see members of various Los Angeles gangs, namely Bloods and Crips, sharing the stage in peace and calling for an end to violence between them. In addition to this display, K.Dot also spoke on the loss of Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant, and how this moment is also for them and all the other unnamed lives lost in these struggles.\n\n\"This s**t making me emotional,\" Kendrick Lamar remarked after a performance that followed, among many other parts of Mustard's set, a tribute to Nip. \"We been f***ed up since Nipsey died. We been f***ed up since Kobe died. This is unity at its finest. We done lost a lot of homies to this music s**t, to this street s**t. For all of us to be together on stage, that s**t is special. Everybody on this stage got fallen soldiers.\" This falls alongside Mr. Morale's previous statements on gang unity and how he advocated for that within his art.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar Appears To Pay Tribute To Tupac's Source Awards Outfit\n\nWhether or not Los Angeles gang culture responds in kind remains to be seen, but let's bask in the moment and appreciate the message. After all, Kendrick Lamar is not our savior, and there were some notable exclusions from this \"Pop Out\" that indicate that, at least on a music industry level, there's still some unity to achieve. The Game pledged his support for Drake in many's eyes through his social media and his Rick Ross diss. As such, this prompted a lot of speculation online about what could be going on behind the scenes.\n\nMeanwhile, other special appearances in \"The Pop Out\" crowd included a SZA, who donned a disguise to party with the people. Even if this was born out of a feud, it's still great to see Kendrick Lamar take advantage of the opportunity to speak to something greater.

Dr. Dre ignited the uproar with the words, \"I see dead people.\"\n\nIn an electrifying finale, Lamar performed his viral diss track \"Not Like Us\" live for the first time... and continued to do so four more times. The hip-hop visionary unveiled this massive summer hit when he was in a back-and-forth rap battle with Drake, which debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in May.\n\nThe noteworthy moment got even more special when the Compton rapper brought out every performer for a group photo onstage, uniting artists across various Los Angeles neighborhoods and affiliations. Before DJ Mustard's set, DJ Hed kicked off the evening with a roster of West Coast artists including Bino Rideaux, Ohgeesy, Westside Boogie, Jason Martin and Remble.\n\n\"Let them see this. We put this together with peace. I promise this won't be the last of us,\" Lamar proudly stated while closing out his moving L.A. show.\n\nFor some, Kendrick Lamar's concert goes down in history as another respectable feat in his music track record, but this showcase was personal for West Coast music and culture aficionados who take pride in their traditions and ways of life.\n\nThe West Coast has long been mourning L.A. figures Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant -- both who had transformative messages of hope, work ethic and victory -- since they were taken too soon by tragic passings.\n\n\"This sh*t making me emotional. We been f*cked up since Nipsey died. We been f*cked up since Kobe died,\" Lamar even admitted at the Pop Out. DJ Mustard also gave a heartwarming tribute to Nipsey Hussle during his set, displaying a license plate that said the following: \"RIP NIP. The Marathon Continues.\"\n\nLamar's Juneteenth celebration served as a communal healing event that reminded the community why West Coast takes so much pride in its culture despite some of its darkest moments. Regardless of the (sometimes) haunting past, West Coast culture respectively thrived at the Pop Out with its undeniable union to stand together and remind the world its great impact on a global scale.

Dot's rap nemesis. There were tees being sold on the street by bootleggers that depicted Lamar as a slave leading an uprising and whipping Drake, who was depicted as a \"colonizer.\" A few fans rocked bootlegged tees where Kendrick held a baby in his arms like on the cover of his \"Mr. Moral & the Big Steppers\" album -- but instead of an infant, the fan's tee had Drake's face imposed on the youngster's body, inferring that the Canadian superstar had gotten \"sonned\" in their contentious musical beef earlier this year.\n\nThe rivalry between Lamar and Drake took a turn weeks ago, with Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" serving as a definitive, distancing salvo in an exchange that had been entertaining and arguably more or less even in the first few rounds. However, \"Not Like Us\" dropped and instantly became the biggest record in hip-hop, pronouncing a clear-cut win for Lamar.\n\nYet he'd rarely appeared publicly throughout the battle -- until Wednesday night, when the audience at the Forum and on Amazon Prime gathered to hear and see these new songs and more come to life.\n\nThe show was divided into three sections, the first a set of West Coast artists under DJ Hed, the second under \"Not Like Us\" producer Mustard, and the third headlined by Lamar. Hed's set featured new Top Dawg Entertainment artist Ray Vaughn, all-female rappers Cuzzos, along with Blue Bucks Clan and Westside Boogie.\n\nMustard played a string of his own hits from over the years, including Tyga's \"Rack City,\" and 2 Chainz's \"I'm Different,\" before Dom Kennedy, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, and YG joined him on stage to separately perform some of their biggest hits, with Tyler leading the crowd in a singalong on \"Earfquake.\" His set also included a section dedicated to late L.A. rapper Nipsey Hussle.\n\nWith Lakers past (Russell Westbrook), present (LeBron James) and possibly future (L.A. natives James\n\nHarden and Demar Derozen) in the house, along with a slew of music luminaries including the Weeknd, Rick Ross, Hit Boi, Lamar didn't make anyone wait to hear his now-classic battle raps. After fans chanted the \"O-V-hoe\" call-and-response on \"Not Like Us,\" Lamar launched his set with a missile straight out the gate, starting off with \"Euphoria,\" unveiling a new verse that stated: \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect\" (head here for more on that). As he rose onto the stage on a riser and began rapping calmly on one knee, it was pure electricity.\n\n\"L.A., we unified with this thing of ours tonight?,\" he asked the crowd after he'd finished.\n\nAfter a roar in response, he replied \"Say less,\" although he had much more to say over the next two hours.\n\nThe energy stayed elevated with staples from his catalog, like \"Element,\" \"DNA\" and \"Humble.\" Day-one fans were electrified to see special guests Schoolboy Q, AB-Soul, and Jay Rock join Lamar onstage for a \"Black Hippy\" reunion medley of \"Money Trees,\" \"Win,\" \"King's Dead,\" \"6:16 In LA,\" \"Collard Greens,\" \"That Part\" and \"King Kunta.\" Dr. Dre even popped in to perform \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love.\"\n\nBut the event everyone was anticipating was \"Not Like Us.\" The song has connected like no other dis record before: As Lamar said on Wednesday night, the song is about much more than a back-and-forth between rival MCs, it's more than a euphoric beat to dance to and a magnetic chorus. It's about bringing real change to the hip-hop community and the neighborhoods of Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's bigger than me\" he said, noting that he was getting emotional.\n\nNot only did Lamar bring a slew of West Coast artists onstage with him as he performed \"Not Like Us\" six different times, he also had people from different gangs and neighborhoods -- inferring that some were from a rival side -- rocking with him in solidarity.\n\n\"We been fucked since Nipsey died,\" he shouted. \"We been fucked up since Kobe died. This makes me proud as a muthafucka. This shit is special, man.\"\n\nWhether Wednesday's show was the final salvo in Lamar's battle with Drake remains to be seen -- but more importantly, it could also be the opening of a major resurgence in the West Coast hip-hop that Lamar was raised on, and which he now leads. As DJ Hed said at the top of the evening, \"The West has something to say.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She Doesn't Know Why People Say Otherwise\n\nKendrick Lamar's hometown Juneteenth show at Los Angeles' Kia Forum was a star-studded ode to West Coast rap that culminated with dozen of artists and entertainers joining Lamar for an unprecedented moment of unity on stage. The concert had been announced less than two weeks before, on the back of Lamar's victorious nine-song-long rap battle with Drake.\n\nThe Pop Out: Ken & Friends was curated into three sections, the first collection of West Coast artists under DJ Hed, the second under storied \"Not Like Us\" producer Mustard, and the third headlined by Lamar. Before Kendrick even took the stage, DJ Hed had many rising and established Los Angeles stars perform, like new Top Dawg Entertainment signee Ray Vaughn, all-girl rap group Cuzzos, male group Blue Bucks Clan and Westside Boogie. The legendary krump dancer Tommy the Clown and a large crew also broke it down and battled on stage.\n\nMustard played a string of his own hits from over the years, including Tyga's \"Rack City,\" and 2 Chainz's \"I'm Different,\" before Dom Kennedy, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, Tyler the Creator, Roddy Ricch and YG joined him on stage to separately perform some of their biggest hits. Tyler's \"Earthquake,\" Lacy's \"Bad Habit,\" and YG's \"Toot It and Boot It,\" and Roddy Ricch's \"The Box\" especially made waves. There was a section dedicated to Nipsey Hussle in which Mustard played their collaboration \"Perfect 10\" as well.\n\nAfter Kendrick hit the stage to perform \"Euphoria,\" \"DNA,\" and \"Alright,\" he was joined by his former TDE label mates and Black Hippie comrades Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q. Jay Rock and Kendrick performed their Good Kid, M.A.A.D City collaboration \"Money Trees,\" as well as Jay Rock's \"Win\" and \"King's Dead.\" Ab-Soul and Kendrick performed his verse on Kendrick's Drake diss \"6:16 in LA,\" and all four remained on stage for ScHoolboy Q's \"Collard Greens\" and \"THat Part.\"\n\nPromising to put on for the legacy of Los Angeles, Dr. Dre emerged to perform \"Still D.R.E.\" with Kendrick filling in at Snoop Dogg's parts and introduced Lamar's performances of the explosive Drake diss \"Not Like Us\" - of which there were five.\n\nAt the show's end, Lamar made sure emphasize the concert's purpose was not just a victory lap, but unification effort. \"We done lost a lot of homies to this music shit, a lot of homies to this street shit,\" he said, noting that the show featured artists from several different gang factions. He promised this was the first of more cross-city collaborations.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Despite being from Compton, the hometown show featured a star-studded lineup, including Dr. Dre, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, Tyler The Creator, and Steve Lacy. Video clips from the event quickly went viral, showcasing the top talent from Southern California.\n\nAnticipation was high for Drake's response, especially after Lamar repeatedly performed his provocative track \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nDrake's response, however, left his nearly 150 million Instagram followers puzzled. The rapper posted a mirror selfie in a Cleveland jersey with the caption, \"Summer League.\"\n\nSome fans speculated that Drake's post was a direct jab at his close friend LeBron James, a well-known hip-hop enthusiast and past collaborator in various parties and business ventures. James, a player for the Los Angeles Lakers, was seen at Lamar's concert, conveniently located just a short drive away at the Kia Forum in Inglewood.\n\n\"He's wearing a Cleveland jersey. Is he trolling LeBron?!!\" another person wondered.\n\nAnother theory suggests that Drake's post could be a dig at NBA star Russell Westbrook. The Los Angeles Clippers point guard joined Lamar onstage during the concert Wednesday night.\n\n\"I think Drake was trying to say Westbrook a- might have to compete in the summer league for a roster spot this year,\" the respondent said.\n\nOn June 19, Kendrick Lamar solidified his status as the undisputed king of hip-hop. However, some Drake fans interpret his cryptic Instagram story as a sign that the \"You the Best\" rapper is gearing up for a major comeback this summer, potentially releasing an album or song targeting Lamar.", "source": {"uri": "rollingout.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Out"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type":

Those streams have ended and cannot be replayed.\n\nDuring the show - Kendrick's first since he's heated rap beef with Drake earlier this year - the rapper kicked off his incendiary set with the live debut of his Drake diss 'Euphoria', which featured a deafening singalong from the audience.\n\nThe performance also featured a new verse, in which Kendrick called for Drake to return Tupac's ring: \"Give me Tupac ring back and I might give you a little respect\". The dig comes after Drake seemingly confirmed on Travis Scott's 'Meltdown' that he had purchased one of Tupac's rings at an auction.\n\nIt is also worth noting that for the concert, Kendrick Lamar donned jeans, a white tee and a red hoodie - an outfit similar to what Tupac had worn for a concert in 1994.\n\nAfer 'Euphoria', Kendrick Lamar performed hits like 'DNA.', 'ELEMENT.', 'Alright', 'Swimming Pools', and more before bringing out Jay Rock to perform the latter's 'Money Trees' and 'King's Dead'.\n\nKendrick then returned to dissing Drake, performing '6:16 in LA' for the first time ever. He followed that up by inviting ScHoolboy Q onstage to perform 'Collard Greens' and 'THat Part'.\n\nAfter playing a collection of his other career-spanning hits including 'King Kunta' and 'HUMBLE.', Lamar performed 'Like That', the song that reignited the long-dormant rap beef back in March this year.\n\nAfterwards, Kendrick surprised those in attendance by bringing out Dr. Dre to perform 'Still D.R.E' and 'California Love', before getting Dre to whisper in \"Pssst, I see dead people\" line in 'Not Like Us'.\n\nKendrick Lamar then went on to perform 'Not Like Us' a whopping five more times, for a total of six performances. He performed the track once with Dr. Dre, on his own twice, once with DJ Mustard and two more times with various guests onstage include Steve Lacy, Black Hippy, YG, Big Boi and more.\n\nKendrick Lamar's 'The Pop Out: Ken & Friends' setlist was:\n\n'Euphoria' (live debut)\n\n'DNA.'\n\n'ELEMENT.'\n\n'Alright'\n\n'Swimming Pools (Drank)'\n\n'Money Trees' ft. Jay Rock\n\n'WIN' ft. Jay Rock\n\n'King's Dead' ft. Jay Rock\n\n'6:16 In L.A.' (live debut)\n\n'Collard Greens' ft. ScHoolboy Q\n\n'THat Part' ft.

Mustard, Black Hippy, Steve Lacy, YG, Big Boi and more (x2)\n\nEarlier in the night, DJ Mustard - who produced Kendrick's 'Not Like Us' kicked off the show with a DJ set that featured guest performances by Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, Tyler, The Creator, Roddy Rich and YG.\n\nAccording to a Complex report, attendees at the 'Pop Out: Ken & Friends' concert included Lebron James, Rick Ross

The line is, \"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nTo make matters worse for Drake, the Kia Forum crowd chanted \"OV-Hoe\" before Lamar took the stage for his set.\n\nLamar released \"Euphoria\" on April 30. The six-plus-minute diss track is a total evisceration. \"Don't tell no lies about me, and I won't tell no truths 'bout you\" is a self-explanatory bar, but Lamar's attacks throughout the song are nuanced -- the embodiment of \"it's levels to this,\" as explained by Uproxx's Wongo Okon.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westside_Boogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westside Boogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blxst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blxst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dom Kennedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Dolla_Sign", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Dolla Sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uproxx", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uproxx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXL_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "XXL (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/DJs", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kendrick-lamar-GRID-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 967}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The event, dubbed \"Ken & Friends - The Pop Out,\" wasn't just a concert; it was a powerful display of unity that brought together over 25 L.A.-based artists for a night filled with electrifying performances, nostalgic throwbacks, and a clear message of West Coast pride.\n\nWhile the concert undoubtedly generated buzz due to Kendrick Lamar's ongoing rap beef with Drake, the true focus was on highlighting the vibrant tapestry of West Coast talent. The evening kicked off with a showcase of 15 up-and-coming L.A. artists, including Ray Vaughn, Cuzzos, Westside Boogie, and Zoe Osama. This opening act served as a powerful testament to the depth and diversity of the Los Angeles hip-hop scene.\n\nAs the night progressed, established stars took center stage. Tyler, the Creator, YG, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, and Steve Lacy all delivered electrifying sets, each showcasing their unique styles and captivating the Inglewood crowd. A particularly poignant moment came during L.A. producer DJ Mustard's set, where a tribute was paid to the late Nipsey Hussle, a beloved figure in the Los Angeles rap community.\n\nOne of the most anticipated moments of the night arrived when Kendrick Lamar reunited with his Black Hippy comrades, Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, and Jay Rock. The TDE (Top Dawg Entertainment) supergroup formed in 2008 and quickly rose to prominence, dropping a string of critically acclaimed albums. Their energetic performance rekindled the chemistry they possess as a collective and brought back memories for fans who have followed their careers since the early days.\n\nThe night took another unexpected turn when the legendary Dr. Dre joined Lamar on stage. The West Coast pioneer delivered iconic hits like \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love,\" further amping up the energy and igniting a wave of nostalgia through the audience.\n\nBut the element that truly sent the crowd into a frenzy was Lamar's performance of his recently released diss track aimed at Drake, \"Not Like Us.\" The track has become a viral sensation, fueled by its scathing lyrics and audacious claims. The anticipation for its live debut had been building throughout the night, with the crowd occasionally chanting \"OV-hoe,\" a line from the diss track, throughout the evening.\n\nLamar didn't disappoint. He not only performed \"Not Like Us\" once but went on to rap the track an additional four times, each rendition generating a more explosive reaction from the audience. With each performance, Lamar emphasized specific lyrics, notably the line \"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" a reference to Drake's alleged attraction to underage girls.\n\nThe energy surrounding \"Not Like Us\" was undeniable. It seemed to serve as a rallying cry for the West Coast pride that permeated the entire show. Lamar's decision to repeatedly perform the diss track became a powerful statement, solidifying his position as a lyrical titan and a defender of West Coast hip-hop.\n\n\"Ken & Friends - The Pop Out\" wasn't just a concert; it was a cultural moment. It showcased the depth and diversity of the Los Angeles hip-hop scene, fostered a sense of unity amongst West Coast artists, and provided a platform for rising stars. But beyond that, it was a celebration of Juneteenth, a day commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States. Kendrick Lamar's closing words resonated deeply: \"We put this together with peace... I promise this won't be the last of us.\"\n\nThis message of unity and continued collaboration holds immense promise for the future of West Coast hip-hop. The concert served as a powerful reminder of the immense talent, creativity, and resilience that define this vibrant musical scene. As Lamar and his fellow artists move forward, one thing is certain: the West Coast remains a force to be reckoned with in the world of hip-hop.", "source": {"uri": "phonemantra.com", "dataType":

The song's cover art appeared to mock Lamar's shoe size with a picture of a size 7 sneaker.\n\nOn the track, the \"God's Plan\" rapper poked fun at his foe's record deal with Top Dawg Entertainment.\n\nAfter Lamar did not respond, Drake then followed up with \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" in which he used AI voices of West Coast rappers Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur, expressing their disappointment in Lamar's silence.\n\nHowever, Lamar didn't remain silent for too long, as he then released the six-minute song \"Euphoria\" on April 30, in which he called out Drake for using the N-word and acting tough.\n\nAfter both rappers released several more disses, their beef seemingly came to a head when the \"Poetic Justice\" performer dropped \"Not Like Us.\"\n\n\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any bitch that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him,\" he rapped on the track.\n\nThe Toronto native then denied liking underage girls in \"The Heart Pt 6,\" rapping, \"Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected / If I was f-king young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested / I'm way too famous for this s-t you just suggested.\"\n\nDrake was seemingly unbothered by the success of Lamar's Juneteenth show, as he shared a mirror selfie on Instagram after the concert wrapped.\n\n\"Summer League,\" he captioned the pic of him wearing a throwback Cleveland Indians jersey, baggy parachute pants and white platform boots.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humble (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Bling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotline Bling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God's_Plan_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God's Plan (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Care_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Take Care (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Then step this way to learn how to watch the one-time concert online.\n\nThe \"Not Like Us\" rapper, born and raised in Compton, will treat Los Angeles fans at the Kia Forum to a one-night performance of his hits and new music on Wednesday. The Juneteenth show, announced earlier this month, will mark K.Dot's first live set in SoCal since trading scathing diss tracks with Drake in recent months.\n\nResale tickets to Lamar's \"The Pop Out -- Ken & Friends\" are still available on Ticketmaster, but currently range anywhere from $496 to $2,500. Luckily, fans have another, cheaper option to catch the concert: They can stream it online.\n\nAmazon's Prime Video will stream the event, produced by Lamar's pgLang label and agency Free Lunch, starting at 4 p.m. According to Prime Video, Kendrick will be joined by \"special guests.\" Twitch, owned by Amazon, will also livestream the show via Amazon Music's channel.\n\n\"We're locked in,\" Twitch tweeted Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"The Pop Out\" takes its name from a line in Lamar's upbeat \"Not Like Us,\" one of several diss tracks he released responding to Drake's allegations of domestic violence. The hip-hop icons' public feud can be traced back to March, when Lamar said in a verse of Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" that he rejects the idea that Drake and J. Cole matched his talents -- a concept J. Cole touted last year in Drake's \"First Person Shooter.\"\n\nThe beef took a dark turn as Lamar and Drake released multiple diss tracks, each responding to the other with fierce allegations of concerning behavior in tracks including Drake's \"Family Matters\" and Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" and \"Meet the Grahams.\" Amid the feud, Drake's home in Toronto became the site of a shooting that left a security guard hospitalized for a gunshot wound.\n\nIn recent weeks it seems tensions between the two rappers, and some of their collaborators, have eased. In late May, Drake seemingly poked fun at Metro Boomin's viral \"BBL Drizzy\" beat,\" rapping over the instrumentals in a verse for Sexxy Red's \"U My Everything.\"\n\nLamar, on the other hand, takes over the Kia Forum amid online speculation that he will allegedly film a music video for \"Not Like Us\" in Compton this week.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGLang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGLang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Celebrating Los Angeles. Coming together in a display of peace and unity. And also hating Drake. The show, produced by Amazon and streamed live on Twitch, built to a fascinating crescendo. As members of LA's various gangs took the stage, Kendrick performed \"Not Like Us\" six times in a row. Well, once was instrumental and came after a group photo. Here's everything that went down.\n\nKendrick offered a Whitman's Sampler of his Drake diss tracks. He opened the show with \"Euphoria.\" He added the line \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect,\" he said. Besides \"Euphoria\" and \"Not Like Us,\" Lamar performed \"6:16 in LA\" and \"Like That\" during The Pop Out.\n\nAudiences went wild when Jay Rock joined Lamar on stage for \"Money Trees.\" Then Ab-Soul came out. Then Schoolboy Q came out. It was a full Black Hippy reunion, and the supergroup performed \"King's Dead\" all together for the first time since 2018.\n\nDr. Dre came out to Inglewood to do his songs \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love.\" He also helped out on the first playthru of \"Not Like Us.\" That's gotta hurt, Drake. Dre kicked the song off with the \"I see dead people line,\" and the crowd went wild.\n\nKendrick did \"Not Like Us\" again and again and again (and then two more again's). After the show concluded, \"SIX TIMES\" was trending on Twitter. The stage got more and more crowded as the song repeated. Lamar was reportedly joined by YG, Steve Lacy, all of Black Hippy, Big Boy, G Perico, Mustard (who you may recognize from being on the beat), LA Clipper Russell Westbrook, Chicago Bull Demar Derozan, krumper Tommy the Clown, and members of every major gang in Los Angeles. While taking the concert-ending group photo, Kendrick insisted this moment was about way more than just rap beef. He shouted out Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant, and said everyone on stage has lost someone to violence, and that they were here today to represent a unified LA.

In the photos, a few loyal fans are seen already lined up for the event. Obviously, they have quite a long wait ahead of them. Needless to say, however, they'll likely secure the best seats in the house.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar To Host \"The Pop Out - Ken & Friends\" Tonight: How To Watch For Free\n\nWhile this certainly shows an impressive amount of commitment on fans' part, it doesn't necessarily come as a shock. Tickets for the event went on sale to the general public earlier this month and sold out in a matter of seconds. Supporters grabbed screenshots from the queue while waiting to purchase tickets, revealing that there were more than 100K others in front of them. The performance should be quite the spectacle and could go down as one of the biggest events in hip-hop this year.\n\nFortunately for those unable to make the LA show tonight, it'll also be available to stream on both Prime Video and Twitch. DJ Hed and his crew will kick things off with a set starting at 7 p.m. EST, followed by Mustard at 7:45 p.m. Kendrick himself is expected to go on at 8:45 p.m., along with his mystery special guests.

It ended with Drake's \"The Heart Part 6,\" a play on Lamar's long-running song series of the same name, and showed that Drake was tiring of the beef between them.\n\nDrake recently made a reference to the battle with a verse on Sexyy Red's \"U My Everything,\" where he rapped over producer Metro Boomin's diss beat \"BBL Drizzy.\" Metro helped facilitate the start of the beef with Lamar's appearance on his song \"Like That,\" a collaboration with Future that came out in March.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tupac Shakur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chance_and_the_Contortions", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Chance and the Contortions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Chance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxophone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saxophone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guest appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kendrick-Lamar-by-Greg-Noire-for-The-Big-Steppers-Tour-2022_GN_00286s-copy-e1666563492676.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

During the show, he brought out a plethora of collaborators, friends, Top Dawg Entertainment affiliates, and fellow California artists. The grand finale was arguably the most memorable moment of it all, as K. Dot performed \"Not Like Us\" not once, not twice, but six times.\n\nThe Mustard-produced record was the final offering from Kendrick during his rap beef with Drake earlier this year. Within its scathing lyrics, K. Dot accuses the Toronto star of being a \"pedophile,\" calls him a \"colonizer\" for capitalizing off of Atlanta Hip-Hop culture, pokes fun at the OVO owl by referring to them as \"bird n**gas and bird b**ches,\" and much more.\n\nThe performance was heightened by the co-signs present at the Kia Forum event, with people like Tyler, The Creator, Russell Westbrook, Dr. Dre, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q, Steve Lacy, and plenty more hitting the stage to support Kendrick. Check out a recap of the finale performance below.\n\nOne of the most reposted moments on social media highlighted the elite camera work from the legendary performance, which was streamed on Amazon Prime Video. While Kendrick rapped, \"Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles/ Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, f**k 'em up/ Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff/ Why you trollin' like a b**ch? Ain't you tired?/ Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" the camera angles switched rapidly to show different perspectives of the live rendition.\n\nMany people are declaring The Pop Out as the official nail in the coffin of the rap beef. Drake and Kendrick were going at each other all throughout April and May after Kendrick fired the first shot in \"Like That\" by Future and Metro Boomin. Drake swung back with \"Push Ups\" and the since-deleted \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\"\n\nThen, the \"Money Trees\" rapper went deep with \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in L.A.,\" which caused the 6 God to fight back with \"Family Matters.\" However, Lamar stepped on that release by dropping \"Meet the Grahams\" just 30 minutes afterward. The final round came with Kendrick's aforementioned \"Not Like Us\" and the \"Hotline Bling\" rapper's last rebuttal, \"The Heart Part 6.\" The latter song claimed that Drake was feeding Kendrick false information the entire time. Drake eventually waved the white flag via his Instagram Story, which read, \"Good times, summer vibes up next.\" Revisit both final offerings below.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news",

Over the last day or so, there has been some speculation surrounding the use of bots, particularly on the latter's side. Of course, one of those Drizzy supporters who has been leading the charge has been DJ Akademiks. To try and make his case for how the Canadian artist technically won the battle, he brought on an alleged stream botter who was supposedly paid off by Lamar's manager, Anthony Saleh. He had a screenshot of the Zelle transfer, equating to a $2500 payout. However, not a lot of people online are buying this, as it could very well be a hoax. But Joe Budden is one of those who actually believes that Kendrick Lamar did utilize bots.\n\nA clip from today's podcast, which is 734 deep, was shared on X moments ago debating this very topic. In the 40-second breakdown, Joe Budden goes as far as to claim that he knew Lamar was boosting his numbers to outpace Drake. While this is still all up in the air right now, it could leave a bit of a stain on how dominant Kung Fu Kenny was during the beef. However, if this true, Joe could not care less even if he really tried.\n\nRead More: LL Cool J & Eminem Collaboration Leaks Online, Fans React\n\nIn a completely flat and passionless delivery, the podcast host says, \"Y'all didn't know that Kendrick used bots? You thought that this was just the first time miraculously that a Drake record ever had more dislikes than likes or you didn't know that was bots? Bots to me was a part of how you win the war versus Drake\". Budden also went onto to claim that Drake was also a culprit of bot usage during this, which is another interesting development. As expected, there were several Drake fans who were not happy with his take. \"Bitter Budden strikes again. How u gunna sit there and act like botting streams is normal and accepted\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Drake never had a chance with these fools\".\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Joe Budden's reaction to Kendrick Lamar allegedly using bots during the Drake beef? Are you surprised that he had such a passionless reaction, why or why not? Do you think Kendrick actually used the help of bots to boost streaming numbers?

(AP) - Not content with merely taking a victory lap after winning his battle against fellow rap superstar Drake, Kendrick Lamar turned his Juneteenth \"Pop Out\" concert at the Forum into a cathartic livestreamed celebration of Los Angeles unity.\n\nLamar curated a three-hour concert featuring a mix of up-and-coming LA rappers and stars including Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy and YG. When it was his turn to take the stage, the 37-year-old rapper powered through a set with Black Hippy collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, performed his Drake diss songs \"Euphoria\" and \"6:16 in LA,\" then was joined on-stage by Dr. Dre.\n\nThe two West Coast titans performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before Dre quieted the roaring crowd by calling for a moment of silence. It was a misdirect. He then delivered the \"Sixth Sense\" quote that opens Lamar\u00b4s chart-topping \"Not Like Us\": \"I see dead people.\"\n\nA crowd of 17,000 that included The Weeknd, LeBron James, Ayo Edebiri and Rick Ross rapped along to every word of the biting-but-jubilant DJ Mustard production, which Lamar restarted twice after the first verse and performed four times in full.\n\nShuffling, frolicking, dancing and spinning around him as Lamar strode the stage in a red hoodie: NBA stars Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan, Mustard, rapper Roddy Ricch and even a teenage dance troupe led by the krumping innovator Tommy the Clown.\n\nLamar reveled in the moment: \"Y'all ain\u00b4t gon' let nobody disrespect the West Coast. Y'all ain\u00b4t gon\u00b4 let nobody imitate our legends, huh,\" he said, referring to Drake\u00b4s use of an AI tool to mimic 2Pac\u00b4s voice on one of his diss records.\n\nBut Lamar had more on his mind, calling out to specific men and women to join him on-stage for a group photo.\n\n\"Let the world see this,\" he said. \"For all of us to be on this stage together, unity, from East side ... LA, Crips, Bloods, Piru - this ... is special, man. We put this ... together just for ya\u00b4ll.\n\n\"This ... ain\u00b4t got nothing to do with no song at this point, ain\u00b4t got nothing to do with no back and forth records, it\u00b4s got everything to do with this moment right here. That\u00b4s what this ... was about, to bring all of us together.\"\n\nAfter the final song, Lamar exited, saying \"I promise you this won't be the last of us.\" The stabbing horns of the \"Not Like Us\" instrumental kicked in once again and the crowd rapped the lyrics without Lamar as they filed through hallways out to the parking lot.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Although he entered his feud with Kendrick feeling confident, he ultimately got blown out thanks to \"Meet The Grahams\" and \"Not Like Us.\" Overall, most fans believe Kendrick won the battle. This was subsequently strengthened by some weak verses on \"U MY EVERYTHING\" and the parody track \"Wah Gwan Delilah.\" However, Drake is now setting his sights on his new ranch in Texas, which cost him a cool $15 million.\n\nOver the weekend, Drake was seen posted up at the ranch, where he was taking photos with horses. Moreover, his trip to Texas led to some speculation and reports that he is filming a music video. Some believe he is looking to dabble in country music. Meanwhile, others just think Drake is changing locations to get some inspiration. Whatever the case may be, he is clearly looking to make a new home for himself down South.\n\nRead More: LL Cool J Thinks Drake Vs. Kendrick Lamar Battle Was Great For Music\n\nIn the Facebook post above, Drake could be seen at the Brenham Saddle Shop. As the owners of the shop revealed, the superstar's team called ahead of time. That's when they let the shop know he would be swinging by. The owners then went on to note that they opened up the shot ahead of time for Drake, and that his entire team was courteous. They had nothing but good things to say about the artist. Furthermore, he even stopped to take a photo with all of them. It was a cool moment and one that will likely continue to happen in other shops as Drake looks to make connections in the state.\n\nLet us know what you think of Drake's latest moves, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that Drake is going to pivot into country music like a lot of other artists have been doing? Do you even want to hear anything else from Drizzy this year?

Some of the best-loved performers in the world have now worked or will soon work alongside major streaming services, with Amazon Prime, in particular, a go-to place for the championing of the best in music. From Ed Sheeran to Lil Durk and even Green Day, Amazon Music Live offers fans a chance to see their favorite artists from their homes.\n\ncollider video of the day\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nOne such artist who has already found Prime to be the perfect home for their music is Kendrick Lamar, with the rapper and songwriter previously having his 2022 live concert, Kendrick Lamar Live: The Big Steppers Tour, streamed across the world. Now, the two are combining again for Kendrick's next project, The Pop Out - Ken & Friends. Since 2009, he's had the world jumping to his incredible music. So, with that in mind, here is a breakdown of exactly how you can watch and stream Kendrick's concert.\n\nWhen is Kendrick Lamar's Concert Coming Out?\n\nThe Pop Out - Ken & Friends live concert officially begins at 4 p.m. PT/ 7 p.m. ET. For K-Dot lovers in the UK, of which there are many, this means the concert will begin at midnight. On the night before the concert, it was revealed via social media that DJ Hed and Mustard would be the show's opening act.\n\nWhere Can You Stream 'The Pop Out - Ken & Friends'?\n\nOfficially, The Pop Out - Ken & Friends will be available to stream on Prime Video, adding it to the mouth-watering list of other content available on the platform. If you're someone without a Prime subscription who needs one in time for the concert, a Prime Video subscription is $8.99 per month or can come as part of the greater Prime package, which costs $14.99 per month. Alternatively, an annual subscription is available for $139.\n\nWatch on Prime\n\nCan You Stream 'The Pop Out - Ken & Friends' Without Prime?\n\nThe short answer is, yes! If you don't have access to Prime and still want to watch The Pop Out - Ken & Friends, streaming will also be available via Amazon Music's Twitch Channel.\n\nWatch on Twitch\n\nWill There Be More Than One Performance of 'The Pop Out - Ken & Friends'?\n\nUnfortunately, this special concert was promoted as a one-off event, meaning that no other performances have been scheduled. This is in line with the Juneteenth celebrations and is part of Amazon's Black Music Month celebration, championing the very best of the artists who have pioneered Black music, from producers to songwriters and performers.\n\nThe chance to see one of the greatest rappers and performers of all time was met with high demand, with tickets for the concert selling out instantly. Some even took to social media to claim that they were in an online queue of over 100,000 people, such as Kendrick's worldwide appeal. However, the allure of this show is also thanks in some small part to the battle Kendrick has recently had with Canadian rapper Drake, with this Kendrick's first major live performance since the debacle reignited. With their decade-long public clash taking somewhat of a hiatus in recent times, March saw Kendrick revisit the dispute in an appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's single \"Like That\", in which he took the opportunity to call out both Drake and J. Cole for their 2023 single \"First Person Shooter.\"\n\nThe response to the recent beef has been mixed, with many taking to various online platforms to express their frustrations that an old fire has been relit, all whilst Drake and Kendrick exchange diss tracks. Their claims against each other continued to grow in severity, with the two eventually pulling no punches and proving their disdain for each other is visceral. Some claim that this is part of the reason Kendrick is holding this concert, with the official announcement made just two weeks before its release on June 5.\n\nOther Content to Watch if You Like 'The Pop Out - Ken & Friends'\n\nIf you're one of the many who will be tuning in for the live Kendrick concert, you're likely a fan of music in general, with plenty of eye-opening music-based movies waiting to stream online. Here are two such suggestions.\n\n'Quincy' (2018)\n\nIntricate personal documentaries are at their best when conducted with a clear passion for the subject, with Quincy being one of the best examples of this on Netflix. For over 70 years, Quincy Jones was one of the most influential men in music. Not just incredibly popular and even more talented, Quincy was also a pioneer for breaking down the barriers that created racial inequality within the music industry, proving once and for all that music was meant to be appreciated no matter its origin. Even earning a Primetime Emmy, this doc makes for fascinating viewing, as well as a pivotal watch for anyone who considers themselves a fan of modern music, seeing as much of it was influenced by Quincy himself.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell' (2021)\n\nBiggie: I Got a Story to Tell\n\nDocumentary\n\nMusical\n\nRelease Date March 1, 2021\n\nDirector Emmett Malloy\n\nCast The Notorious B.I.G.\n\nRuntime 97\n\nMain Genre Documentary\n\nStudio Netflix\n\nTagline Every legend has an origin story.\n\nExpand\n\nThere have been countless documentaries made about the short life of Christopher Wallace (Biggie Smalls), but some might say this is the best. Directed by Emmett Malloy and written by Sam Sweet, this movie depicts the private and public life of one of hip-hop's greatest performers, showcasing never-before-seen footage of the man himself. Despite many claiming to have truly captured the essence of the man before, Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell feels like the most unadulterated and honest portrayal of the rapper, with this view into his mind-blowing world unlike any other. The movie even won the Grierson British Documentaries Award for Best Music Documentary.\n\nWatch on Netflix", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_hodges@collider.com", "name": "Jake Hodges", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notorious_B.I.G.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Notorious B.I.G."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Steppers_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Big Steppers Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Albums_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UK Albums Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Durk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lil Durk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BET+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Boomin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro Boomin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Cole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The rapper removed a few lines from the song's second verse, and inserted a new one as well. He referenced Drake's purchase of a piece of west coast hip-hop memorabilia, apparently demanding its return.\n\nLamar played to a crowd of 17,000 people at The Forum in Los Angeles on Wednesday, live-streaming the show via Amazon Music at the same time. His most recent songs are diss tracks aimed at Drake, and he sprinkled them throughout the setlist. When he played \"Euphoria,\" he altered the lyrics starting in the second verse, starting at the refrain: \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk / I hate the way that you dress.\" Lamar replaced the lines that followed with some of the lyrics from the third verse, where he uses the same refrain.\n\n\"I even hate it when you say the word 'n-,' but that's just me I guess,\" he rapped. \"Some s- just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep I guess / Still love when you see sucess / Everything with me is blessed / Keep making me dance, waving my hands, and it won't be no threat / I'm knowing they call you the Boy, but where is the man? Cause I ain't seen him yet.\"\n\nHere, Lamar interjected with a brand new line not in his original recording. Holding his hand out, he said: \"Give me Tupac's ring back, and I might give you a little respect.\" From there, he jumped back to the beginning of verse three and the song continued.\n\nLamar has been carrying around that complaint for nearly a year now, but the demand has never been more direct. In July of 2023, a custom ring designed and worn by rapper Tupac Shakur was sold at auction for over $1 million, according to a report by CBS News. Drake revealed on Instagram that he was the anonymous buyer, flaunting the ring for his fans. Shakur is synonymous with west coast rap music to this day, and on a night when Lamar and many other L.A.-based rappers gathered to celebrate, Lamar demanded that the Toronto-based Drake hand it over.\n\nShakur wore this iconic crown ring at his last public appearance ever - the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, just over a week before he was shot and killed in Las Vegas. The ring resurfaced after Vegas police obtained a search warrant for the home of Keith \"Keffe D\" Davis, who has been suspected to have been involved with Shakur's murder for several years now. The ring was appraised and auctioned off by Sotheby's, with an initial estimate of $200,000. Drake paid over $1 million for it, and its cultural value cannot be overstated.\n\nShakur designed the ring himself after his release from prison in 1995, and the crown shape was a reference to Niccolo Machiavelli's political manifesto The Prince, which Shakur became obsessed with while behind bars. It features a large ruby and two diamonds, and an engraving reads: \"Pac & Dada 1996\" - a reference to Shakur's engagement to Kidada Jones. It is suspected to be the most expensive piece of hip-hop memorabilia ever sold.\n\nThe symbolic issue goes ever deeper than that, as Tupac's legacy came into Lamar and Drake's beef back in April with Drake's \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\" Drake and producers utilized so-called \"generative artificial intelligence\" software to recreate Shakur's voice and add it to the song rapping a brand new verse. This infuriated Lamar and many other fans - whether they dwell on the west coast or not. Shakur's estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Drake, and the issue even went before the U.S. Congress.\n\nDrake removed the song from streaming services, but Lamar continued to throw that mistake in his face on most of the diss tracks that followed. Now, it seems like the rapper wants Drake to relinquish his ownership of Shakur's legacy in a more tangible way as well. So far, Drake has not responded publicly to Wednesday's massive \"Pop Out\" concert.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This incredible achievement shows the heights of Drake's influence in the music industry.\n\nThis notable accomplishment was reached on Tuesday, June 18, just two months after reports indicated he was approaching the milestone with 97 billion streams. The news was first announced by Chart Data and later confirmed by KWORB, a platform known for its detailed tracking of music streams and rankings across various services.\n\nTaylor Swift holds the second position with 84.4 billion streams, but Drake's lead is remarkable, further proving why he is fondly referred to as the \"king of streaming.\"\n\nBeyond this historic achievement, Drake has recently been in the spotlight for other reasons. He was recently involved in a brawl with Kendrick Lamar that will go down as one of the most heated hip-hop feuds. Evidently, the rap feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has been simmering for years, but it escalated significantly in March 2024. The two rappers dropped several diss tracks aimed at each other for weeks on end.\n\nLamar released Euphoria and 6:16 in LA, targeting Drake. Following this, Drake fired back with Family Matters, accusing Lamar of domestic abuse and questioning paternity. Kendrick then hit back with Meet the Grahams, alleging Drake is involved in sex trafficking and has a secret child. The feud got even more heated with accusations and fingers pointing at each other.\n\nDespite this, Drake's dominance in the music industry remains unchallenged. His 100 billion Spotify streams are a reflection of his consistency and immense popularity around the world. Here are some of Drake's other notable achievements:\n\nDrake ties with Michael Jackson for the most No. 1 songs among solo male artistes, with 13 chart-topper songs. Only The Beatles, Mariah Carey, and Rihanna have more. Additionally, his career features 327 songs that have charted on the Hot 100, the most of all time.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariah Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rihanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/9C2C12EA-30B7-4780-8FB1-79DFFB9FADAE.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 266}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Amid his ongoing feud with Drake, Lamar shared a single titled \"Not Like Us,\" which immediately became a smash. The tune is surging once again after the hip-hop star finally performed it live in glorious fashion.\n\nThe rapper held a special concert on Juneteenth (June 19) in Inglewood, CA that he titled The Pop Out: Ken and Friends. Lamar was on his home turf, and the crowd in attendance was thrilled to see him and his famous guests take to the stage. The performance of \"Not Like Us\" was the highlight of the evening, as it marked the first time the rapper had performed his chart-topping hit live.\n\nLamar didn't just perform \"Not Like Us\" and move on, though. The song is so important and impactful to him, Drake, the hip-hop world, and the music industry in general that it deserved more than that. Lamar went through the tune a minimum of five times, which easily made it not just the standout moment from the show, but a trending topic.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" was discussed by millions online, as people everywhere marveled at Lamar's victory lap. The concert was livestreamed by Amazon as well, so people all around the world could tune in to catch the cut and be a part of the event as well. All that attention has helped the tune surge in popularity once again.\n\nAt the time of writing, \"Not Like Us\" is back inside the top 10 on the iTunes chart in the U.S. The single soars eight spaces to land at No. 10, and it's still early in the day. The song will likely continue to climb in the coming hours as more Americans wake up and learn of Lamar's triumph.\n\nNext week, it's likely that \"Not Like Us\" will bolt up several Billboard charts. The song is still performing well on many lists, and it has recently been jumping to No. 1 on a variety of radio rankings. All these purchases may play a big role in sending it back toward the top of some sales-focused rosters as well, which it has already ruled.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in mid-May. Since then, it's continued to perform extremely well on a number of Billboard charts, and also in plenty of other countries. The tune's success showed Lamar to be the winner of the battle between himself and Drake, even though several other cuts were released during their ongoing spat.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_charts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard charts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Venues", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Venues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66741ee965320c008dffeae7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 407, "textEnd": 414}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Everyone was there, from NBA star Russell Westbrook to Krump dance legend Tommy the Clown and budding rap duo BlueBucksClan.\n\n\"This s--- ain't got nothing to do with no motherf---ing song at this point,\" he said, posing for a group photo. \"It ain't got nothing to do with no back-and-forth records. It's got everything to do with this right here. That's what this s--- was about.\"\n\nThis was a moment that was steeped in nostalgia and cultural pride -- and a clear shot at Drake.\n\nThe remarks -- and the photo -- underscored the loaded meaning of this feud, which featured catchy but cutting lyrics that played on political themes such as Blackness, regional pride, power, privilege, access and, most importantly, authenticity. This was not an argument over who was the better rapper. It was a battle to determine who better represented hip-hop culture.\n\nOver a five-track flurry, Lamar used oppo research -- infused with a heavy dose of conspiracism -- to portray Drake as a manipulator, a misogynist, a grifter who clings to Black gangsta rappers for clout, a deadbeat dad and, quite literally, a \"pedophile.\" (Drake denied the allegations in a song written in response, saying he was \"way too famous\" not to have been arrested already if anything like that had happened.) And much like a skilled politician, Lamar largely made these critiques while ignoring some of his own problematic behavior.\n\nIn song, Drake downplayed and denied many of the claims made by Lamar. But reminiscent of other political campaigns these days, the fact that some of Lamar's claims stemmed from some actual incidents involving Drake that have been known for years appears to have made it difficult for some listeners to dismiss them outright.\n\nIn this campaign, Lamar was always angling to win rap's version of the Electoral College vote more than the popular vote, trying to appeal to respected artists and influencers who could give him their stamp of approval. And in the end, he may have won the popular vote, too, breaking Drake's single-day Spotify record.\n\nThe tactic seems to have worked. As in the actual Electoral College, Lamar's concert showed that winning California can be a boon for one's campaign.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_(culture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop (culture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krumping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krumping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangsta rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240620-kendrick-lamar-vl-217p-80944c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

How Lakers star got involved in rapper feud", "body": "Kendrick Lamar's latest assault on Drake's dome came in the form of a love letter to Lamar's home state.\n\nLamar teamed up with a slew of the West Coast's greatest acts, including YG, Tyler, the Creator and Remble, to celebrate the region's influence on the world of music on Juneteenth.\n\nThe event represented a seminal moment in recent rap history. A number of ballers made sure to be in attendance, including James Harden, Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan -- all three of whom hail from Los Angeles.\n\nAnother L.A. hoops star made his way to Kia Forum on Wednesday as well. Lakers standout LeBron James took to the concourses, offering his presence -- and perhaps taking a side in rap's biggest beef.\n\nJames has a well-documented relationship with both rap stars, having fortified his relationship with Drake on the track, \"Forever\" -- a tune whose music video featured James prominently. The pair have continued collaborating in the years since, with James sharing the stage with Drizzy while the Canadian supernova was on tour a few years back and the two having a famous -- or perhaps, infamous -- interaction with one another on James-led television program, \"The Shop.\"\n\nJames has also heaped praise on Lamar, even playing a role in Lamar's release of \"untitled unmastered.\" back in 2016.\n\nSo, whose side is James on nowadays? The Sporting News takes a look at the recent tidings surrounding James' fandom for both artists.\n\nWarning: The following videos contain NSFW language.\n\nMORE: Why Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan took stage at Kendrick Lamar concert\n\nIf the past few months are any indication, James might be more inclined to support TDE than OVO.\n\nThe Lakers star gave his first public declaration of support for Lamar when he was seen rapping the lyrics to Lamar's verse on Metro Boomin and Future's single, \"Like That,\" the track that started the most recent outburst in Lamar and Drake's long-simmering feud.\n\nMORE: Bronny James drawing interest from a number of NBA teams\n\nFor those who know James and his musical tidings, him repeating Lamar's lyrics without a misstep is a big deal. Such treatment wasn't reserved for Tee Grizzley, Pop Smoke, Lil Baby, Lamar himself or his cousin, Baby Keem.\n\nJames continued to offer tacit support for Lamar as he dropped dagger after dagger to tear into the shadowy silhouette that is OVO. He was videotaped prancing about a club as \"Euphoria,\" another Lamar track directed towards Drake, played in the background.\n\nShortly thereafter, another video emerged of James in the club. This time, he was offering up his dancing chops for Lamar's \"Not Like Us,\" a West Coast-tinged tune produced by Mustard which once more outlines Drake and all of his alleged moral failings.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best free agent options for Lakers\n\nJuneteenth represented the piece de resistance for Lamar in his pursuit of James' support.\n\nThe Lakers superstar was caught once again mimicking Lamar's words and mannerisms at the \"Kenny and Friends\" pop-up concert. As previously stated, the fact that he did so without fumbling Lamar's words is especially notable given his proclivity for doing just that in the past.\n\nSo, is James solely a Lamar fan? Probably not. He hasn't denounced Drake yet, even as Lamar suggested that he should keep his family away on \"Meet the Grahams.\"\n\nIt seems he has put a flag in whose music he prefers at the moment, however. And if recent signs are to be believed, it seems that flag is planted firmly in the West Coast.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [],

Chuck's absence from the lineup at K-Dot's show at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., was pretty shocking, given that he's also from the same hometown as the musicians who performed. In 2011, Game even passed the torch of West Coast rap to Kenny during a concert in Los Angeles with Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger and Warren G. However, people on X, formerly known as Twitter, weren't taken aback by The Game being left out of this major moment for the West Coast. In fact, X users roasted the 44-year-old rapper for not having a set at Kenny's concert.\n\nIndividuals on the social media platform presumed that Game wasn't invited based on him appearing to side with Drake during the Canadian rapper and Kendrick's rap duel, which started on March 22 after Kedrick diss Drake on Metro Boomin and Future's \"Like That.\" The former G-Unit rhymer, who collaborated with The Boy on songs like \"100\" and \"Good Girls Go Bad,\" suggested that he was Team Drake on April 16 after hopping on Instagram and posting a since-deleted video of himself listening to Drizzy's 2015 single \"Energy.\" As the caption, Game quoted a lyric to Drake's song \"I got rap n***as that I gotta act like I like.\"\n\nAfter videos from Kendrick Lamar's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends Concert surfaced on the interwebs, people poked fun at The Game with witty tweets, assumptions about the rapper's next move and hilarious memes. Some X users also wondered why he didn't show up.\n\n\"The Game bout to diss Kendrick Lamar for not inviting him to The Pop Out Show like he did Eminem and Dr Dre. #theynotlikeus,\" one user typed.\n\n\"The Game jumped out the window to defend Drake and now he's at home watching the show with the rest of us,\" another user wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, a third user questioned why The Game seemed to be absent from significant events for the West Coast. \"How does The Game seemingly always end up on the outside looking in of big West Coast moments?\"\n\nNeedless to say, there were many opinions online about The Game's absence from Kendrick Lamar's concert.\n\nTake a look at X users coming for The Game for not being at Kenny's The Pop Out - Ken & Friends concert below.\n\nSee People on X

The show was a reflection of West Coast unity that many of the artists themselves didn't even think was possible, and Kendrick demonstrated how restorative a diss track can really be.\n\nI came into Ken & Friends skeptical about what it would actually feel like. Taking place on Juneteenth, the show was being touted as a major Black cultural tentpole immediately after its surprise announcement two weeks ago. But tickets sold out within minutes and resale prices were reaching such high prices that I assumed the majority of attendees would, in fact, not be \"like us.\" As I spoke with fans walking into the venue before the show started, though, it was clear that this wouldn't be the case. The stream captured a lot of the non-Black folk at the event, but I'd say at least two-thirds of the actual audience were Black or brown, with a good amount of them decked out in custom LA gear. \"Kendrick means everything to the West Coast,\" said one fan who was dressed head-to-toe in Dodgers clothing. \"He represents the best in us.\"\n\nI'm not from the West Coast, but I do know what it feels like to have a strong sense of pride in your city. Anyone who's lived in (or in close proximity to) the trenches knows what it's like when the summertime comes around and block parties start popping up in the neighborhood. Kendrick's Ken & Friends show felt like a block party for the entire West Coast -- a place where artists who would normally have qualms with each other due to street politics could peace it up for the sake of the community. Before the concert, a person close to Dot's camp told me that Kendrick wanted the impromptu show to feel like \"some real hood shit,\" and the 37-year-old Compton rapper ended up capturing the atmosphere of a local block party perfectly.\n\n\"[K Dot] is doing some shit that has never been before, bro,\" rapper AZ Chike explained hours before the show began. \"There's a lot of niggas outside in their trailers that you wouldn't catch on a regular day next to each other. Kendrick really brought the city together. Niggas who really do shit to each other is just here having a good time, and that says a lot.\"\n\nKen & Friends was streamed on Amazon Prime, but what the broadcast didn't show you was the intimate moments backstage, like West Coast legend and Godfather of Krump Tommy the Clown practicing his routine side-by-side with artists like YG and Dom Kennedy. Or how, instead of staying siloed in their trailers, LA artists and their entourages with opposing colored bandanas interacted with each other outside, drinking Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's Gin and Juice-branded beverage. Even just being out there for a few hours had me ending my sentences with \"West Coast\" because the energy was so contagious. \"I've never seen something like this in my lifetime, especially in the music space,\" Kennedy told me. \"It just shows the power of being an artist.\"\n\nInside of the arena, Kendrick opted not to have any elevated risers on the floor for special guests. Instead, all of the celebrities in attendance, including artists who weren't performing, were sitting in the arena seats or standing amongst each other on even footing throughout the general admission floor.\n\nDJ Hed and Mustard kicked the party off by priming the crowd with an impressive lineup of LA guests like Roddy Ricch, Blxst, Tyler, the Creator, and YG, plus a dedication for the late Nipsey Hussle. Throughout the show, nobody was acting too cool or above celebrating Kendrick and his friends. In fact, during Mustard's set, I found myself randomly vibing with LA Clippers star James Harden and Rick Ross while Steve Lacey performed.\n\nThen Kendrick took the stage and started by performing the 6-minute Drake diss \"Euphoria.\" There were a lot of amazing moments during his set -- like bringing out Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q for a Black Hippy reunion -- but none impressed me more than how the sold-out crowd spit this hook-less, high-level rap song bar-for-bar. The primal pettiness of the song became even more potent when it spread across the arena; at that moment, we all hated the way that Drake walks, talks, and dresses. After running through some of his most popular tracks, including \"Money Trees,\" \"Humble,\" and a special rendition of \"6:16 in LA\" with Ab-Soul, the crowd was primed and ready for the main event.", "source": {"uri": "complex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Complex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_rose@complex.com", "name": "Jordan Rose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Block party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blxst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blxst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Trees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money Trees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom_Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dom Kennedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipsey_Hussle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nipsey Hussle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Hippy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The legendary krump dancer Tommy the Clown also graced the stage with his crew.\n\nMustard took over the second segment, playing hits like Tyga's \"Rack City\" and 2 Chainz's \"I'm Different.\" He was joined by artists like Dom Kennedy, Ty Dolla Sign, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator; Roddy Ricch, and YG, all of whom performed their biggest hits.\n\nhttps://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/1803637193002631367\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar took the stage, he delivered powerful performances of \"Euphoria,\" \"DNA,\" and \"Alright.\" He was joined by his former TDE labelmates and Black Hippy comrades Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q. While the quartet was catching vibes onstage, fans got high-energy renditions of \"Money Trees,\" \"Win,\" \"King's Dead,\" \"6:16 in LA,\" \"Collard Greens,\" and \"THat Part.\" One notable highlight was Dr. Dre's surprise appearance for \"Still D.R.E.\" and an introduction of \"Not Like Us,\" which K. Dot performed multiple times.\n\nFortunately, those who were unable to attend had the opportunity to watch a live stream of the entire event, and those who did tune in made sure to express their appreciation on social media. \"Kendrick Lamar just unified real-life gang members,\" wrote Twitter user verypalehipster. \"Had them all take a group pic and got everyone to dance together to a song

Of course, the team behind the show promoted it as an event \"with friends,\" so guest appearances and special performances were par the course. Still, a lot of folks assumed that Ken would bring out Baby Keem and recent collaborators as well, but a more skeptical buzz when it came to whether Black Hippy would reunite. In retrospect, assuming that Mr. Morale wouldn't capitalize on this opportunity with his L.A. brothers sounds outright ridiculous.\n\nMoreover, here's how it all went down. First, Jay Rock emerged during Kendrick Lamar's performance of \"Money Trees\" to deliver one of his best verses ever. Then, Ab-Soul came out to sing the beginning of Kendrick's \"6:16 In LA\" Drake diss, which he had posted a notable video of doing back when the beef was at a more heightened tension level. Finally, ScHoolboy Q came out to his K.Dot collab \"Collard Greens.\" The quartet stuck around to vibe out to Q's \"THat Part\" (no Black Hippy remix verses, sadly) and to Ken's \"King Kunta.\"\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar & His Explosive \"Pop Out\" Show Have Fans Hilariously Speculating On Drake's Reaction To It\n\nObviously, they all popped out for the multiple performances on \"Not Like Us,\" which was another heartening moment to see. If you remove the context of a Drake diss (a near-impossible task, as the setlist opened with \"Euphoria\" and also included the \"Like That\" verse), \"The Pop Out\" seems like a wholly positive and unitary event. It certainly was so, but Kendrick Lamar made it clear that it wasn't all fun and games, either. After all, duality is a Gemini's best friend.\n\nAlso, it was amazing to see some love and renewed respect for Los Angeles legends that the newer generation might be less familiar with. The biggest non-musical example of this is the appearance of Tommy The Clown, an L.A. dance legend that invented the \"clowning\" dance style that led to \"krumping\" during the 1992 Rodney King riots. Surely more info and West Coast history will emerge as a result of Kendrick Lamar's \"Pop Out.\" Hopefully more celebrations of the culture can happen throughout the year that aren't tied to PDF file-downloading allegations.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriel_bras_nevares@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Gabriel Bras Nevares", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Hippy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Dawg_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Top Dawg Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Keem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baby Keem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guest appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergroup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supergroup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Part", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "That Part"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kunta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "King Kunta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collard_Greens_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collard Greens (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Trees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money Trees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolboy_Q", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schoolboy Q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodney King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Hippie", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Hippie", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/06/Kendrick-Lamar-Pop-Out-Concert-Black-Hippy-Reunion-ScHoolboy-Q-Ab-Soul-Jay-Rock-Hip-Hop-News-2337x1575.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Patiently waiting for the right moment to \"pop out and show n****s.\" Now that time is here.\n\nOn Juneteenth, K-Dot will finally get the victory celebration he deserves, and perform at \"The Pop Out: Ken & Friends\" concert at The Forum in Ingelwood, Calif.\n\nThe show and the timing are significant for several reasons, outside of the fact that Lamar won a rap battle against one of the biggest pop stars in the world.\n\nIt's no secret that the Compton MC is extremely prideful about where he's from, his Blackness, and the hip-hop culture as a whole. He's displayed it throughout his illustrious career as a rapper, and during his recent rap battle with the 6 God.\n\nFor example, although the song, \"Not Like Us\" is a scathing diss track that makes some serious accusations against Drake and his crew, it's also a message to all who attempt to latch on to the \"culture\" for fame, fortune and clout, but were never truly apart of it for the love or respect. The Toronto rapper is just the face of it (for Kendrick).\n\nJust listen to the entirety of the third verse, where he essentially breaks down his rivals disregard for a Black mecca like Atlanta and claims that he's been using the city and it's artists. He revokes Drake's culture card claiming he's \"not a colleague\" but a \"f***ing colonizer.\"\n\nAlthough \"Ken & friends\" will be enjoyed by millions, it will mean something more for people who truly recognize he significance of Juneteenth in the Black community. Especially since Lamar has so many other songs outside of \"Not Like Us\" that resonate with the Black community and speak to the difficulties we experience in this country (\"Alright,\" \"Black the Berry,\" \"M.A.A.D City\").\n\n\"Ken & Friends\" will be a victory lap for Black people everywhere and celebration of his people in his community.

KL played \"Not Like Us\" 4 times in a row, and the instrumental even closed out the show!\n\nKendrick made sure Juneteenth 2024 will go down in history ... West Coast DJs Hed and Mustard opened the show and offered no shortage of cameos and hype music for the crowd.\n\nK. Dot eventually hopped onstage and wasted no time reminding the world he came at Drake's neck ... the rapper opened his set with his instant classic diss \"Euphoria\" -- which was a harsh review of Drake and his rep in the game (from Kendrick's POV anyway).\n\nHis TDE and Black Hippy groupmates -- Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul -- also joined Ken onstage, where he blazed through one of his other Drake darts \"6:16 in LA.\"\n\nThe biggest surprise came courtesy of Kendrick's Compton OG mentor, Dr. Dre ... who not only rocked the Kia Forum with his classic records \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" ... but also led right into Kendrick's most scathing diss track against Champagne Papi.\n\nThe \"Chronic\" creator exited stage left whispering the \"Psst... I see dead people\" intro that set off the \"Not Like Us\" onslaught -- like we said, Kendrick played the track several times ... and the crowd was into it each and every time. He did censor himself though ... refraining from saying the word \"pedophile.\"\n\nRap beef aside, the crowning moment came when Kendrick unified several L.A. gangs onstage ... emotionally stating the city's been \"f***ed up\" since Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant died.\n\nBloods, Crips, Pirus, Hoovers and everyone in between all stood together in solidarity and posed for pictures onstage ... a push to hopefully end the gang culture's never-ending war.\n\nAs many have already dubbed him ...

From the excited vendors leading up to the venue, to the smiles on everyone's faces once they entered the building, the feeling was unity. People of all ages and backgrounds fought off a lot of ticket resellers for the chance to experience this day together and you could feel that energy. The choice to have this show on this day was undeniable.\n\nMustard is One of L.A.'s Best Producers\n\nThe producer behind the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 \"Not Like Us\" is no stranger to Hip-Hop, but when his billing said \"and Friends\" it meant just that. The California crowd got to see just how prolific his career has been to this point. Ty Dolla $ign, Tyler the Creator, Roddy Ricch, YG, and more joined him on hit after hit to warm the crowd up for his biggest hit yet.\n\nKendrick Reunited Black Hippy\n\nThroughout the night, Kendrick brought up day ones and this moment was definitely for those people. He reunited his rap supergroup that formed in 2008 and consisted of ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, & Jay Rock.\n\nHe Brought Out Dr. Dre\n\nAs if the show hadn't packed enough punch the Kia Forum almost lost its top as Dr. Dre appeared next to Kendrick and the recognizable cords of \"Still D.R.E.\" grabbed the attention of the audience. The rap legend knew exactly what the people wanted and then went into \"California Love\". But before he could leave the stage Kendrick asked him a favor. Dre whisper \"psssss....I see dead people\" and the room exploded.\n\nHe Performed \"Not Like Us\" Five Times\n\nIf there was any doubt that Kendrick would shy away from his extensive beef with Drake, that evaporated as soon as he rose from the stage and started the lyrics of \"Euphoria\".\n\nNow his set didn't stray away from his hits like \"DNA\", \"King Kunta\", and \"Humble.\" And with the occasion being Juneteenth in many ways his performance of \"Alright\" hit the exact cultural note that people were waiting on \"Not Like Us\" to deliver.\n\nBut after also swinging into \"6:16 in LA\" the crowd went feral when \"Mustard on the Beat\" was heard on the speakers and \"Not Like Us\" began. The audience hung on every word and even extended his iconic \"a-minor\" line acapella. But nobody expected him to repeat the song 5 times. He continued to bring it back and the energy never dipped. The song even played as he excited the stage and the instrumental served as the soundtrack for fans exiting the venue.\n\nNot sure anybody was questioning it at this point, but he does seem to really hate Drake. What was unexpected is that a song about who he refers to as a \"colonizer\" has turned into what is clearly the anthem of Juneteenth.\n\nAs he ended the show he stated: \"It ain't got nothing to do with no back and forth records. It's got everything to do with this moment right here. That's what this shit was about. To bring all of us together.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar",

The show took place at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles and was announced less than two weeks ago. It was streamed live on Twitch by Amazon Music.\n\nKendrick performed the track five times, each more explosive than the last. \"You're not going to let anyone disrespect the West Coast, are you?\" asked Kendrick Lamar after introducing the oft-repeated lyrics of \"A Minor\" (a double entender intended to mock Drake as Lamar accuses him of being sexually inappropriate with underage girls) in the first edition. He largely let the crowd lead the second, and for the third, there were blazing pyrotechnics, dancers, and a loud chant of \"OV-Ho\" as he performed the song to completion. The audience requested a fourth, for which many of the evening's performers and other stars joined in, including YG, Steve Lacy, Roddy Ricch, ScHoolboy Q and Clippers point guard Russell Westbrook. There were dozens of people on stage as Kendrick rapped, danced and ran through them for the fifth time.\n\nKendrick Lamar brings Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan and the entire West Coast to the stage while performing Not Like Us at Pop Out Concert\n\nA moment in history #ThePopOut pic.twitter.com/cDNazGqh0d\n\n- Ahmed/The Ears/IG: BigBizTheGod (@big_business_) June 20, 2024\n\nLamar opened his set with his first solo Drake rant in this spring's jam, \"Euphoria,\" shrouded in red lights, falling fireworks and smoke. He finally performed his verse \"Like That\" which also ignited the beef. He also performed \"DNA\", \"Alright\" and \"King Kunta\". Kendrick spent much of the show accompanied by Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and ScHoolboy Q, former colleagues at the Top Dawg Entertainment label.\n\nReally, one could have argued for Kendrick Lamar to keep \"Not Like Us\" out of the setlist. Although the concert apparently takes its name from the lyrics of \"Not Like Us\" - \"Sometimes you gotta go out and show the niggas\" - Kendrick has clearly already done so over the course of five diss songs in his battle with Drake between late March and early March. Can. The show could have been a celebratory ride that didn't acknowledge Drake's existence at all by keeping these tracks off the roster.\n\nInstead, Kendrick took over with the song that escalated their tensions. Yet ultimately he celebrated the concert as a moment of unification of the multiple, sometimes fractured, facets of Los Angeles' vast hip-hop scene. \"We lost a lot of homies to this musical shit, a lot of homies to this street shit,\" he said, noting that the show featured performers from several different gang factions. He promised that this would be the first in a series of more collaborative moves.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" debuted at number one on the Hot 100 and reached number one on Billboard's Rhythmic Airplay chart dated June 15, signifying its dominance at radio. In it, Lamar accuses Drake of pedophilia and exploiting other rappers. Drake responded with \"The Heart Part 6\" accusing Lamar of domestic violence, estrangement from his children and surviving sexual assault.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

And because there's so much ground to cover and so many acts to talk about -- because you really just had to be there like The Root was, or, at the very least, streamed it on Amazon Prime Video -- let's try to hit the highlights:\n\nArguably the most L.A. setlist of all, the beloved Cali deejay DJ Hed was the first to grace the stage. Espousing his love for the city, he brought along a myriad of well-known Cali artists who've put out some hits that may not immediately come to your mind if you're not from the city, but have still seen some mainstream success.\n\nThose artists included: Remble, Ray Vaughn, Cuzzos, Rucci and AZ Chike, Jay Worthy & The Whoops, Wallie the Sensei, Westside Boogie, Zoe Osama, Kalan FRFR & G Perico, Bino Rideaux, Bluebucksclan, RJMrLA, OhGeesy, and Jason Martin.\n\nIn a nod specifically to L.A. dance culture, Tommy the Clown and his clown dancers also graced the stage for a fire krump dance battle. For those who don't know, Tommy the Clown (legally Thomas Johnson) is a beloved staple in South Central Los Angeles, most known for providing an outlet for inner-city youth to stay out of trouble and express their emotions through the art of \"clown dancing\" which later evolved into the style we know today as \"krumping.\" He got his start back in 1992 and has since kept up with his \"clown crews\" ever since. (If you've seen the documentary Rize from David LaChapelle then you already know how iconic this is.)\n\nWhile locals of L.A. got their entire life to the previous set, the rest of us (Author's Note: yes, I'm a transplant but not too much on me) got a bit more turnt when DJ Mustard popped out for his set. If you've ever heard \"Mustard on the beat, hoe\" at the beginning of any hip-hop or R&B song, then you know what follows is set to be a banger (no pun intended).\n\nFor his portion, he brought out friends like: 310Babii, Blxst, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler the Creator (!!!), Roddy Ricch, and YG.\n\nIn a special moment, Mustard also led the sold-out crowd (which was comprised of mostly non-Black folks in a very Jordan Peel-esque twist) into a tribute to Nipsey Hussle, who tragically died back in March 2019. As lighters (or rather, phone lights) went up in the air, Nipsey's hits like \"Perfect Ten\" and \"Last Time That I Checc'd.\"\n\nNow that the crowd was good and warmed up, the man of the hour himself -- Kendrick Lamar finally popped out and got the festivities jumping right away by performing \"Euphoria\" -- reminding us all why we were all there (to see the final proverbial nail in the coffin in his beef against Drake, duh.)\n\nFrom there he went into \"DNA,\" \"Element,\" \"Alright,\" and \"Swimming Pools\" before bringing out the first of his friends: Jay Rock. The two of them, having been tight since their Black Hippy days, performed \"Money Trees\" and \"King's Dead\" before Jay did one of his solo hit songs \"Win.\" From there, it turned into a quick Black Hippy reunion as fellow memebers AB Soul and Schoolboy Q joined Kendrick onstage. The latter artists performed his hits like \"Collard Greens\" and \"THat Part.\"\n\nAfterwards Kendrick went back in solo with songs like \"King Kunta,\" \"M.a.a.d City,\" \"Humble,\" and Future & Metro Boomin's \"Like That\" (the song that started this year's rap beef to begin with).\n\nBut what was perhaps the 50-leventh most iconic (or controversial depending on who you talk to) moment of the night, L.A. legend Dr. Dre popped up to perform \"Still Dre\" and \"California Love.\" And in a move that could be perceived as L.A.'s giant cosign for Kendrick and ultimate diss against Drake -- Dr. Dre intro'd the song of the summer: \"Not Like Us.\"\n\nAnd not only did Kendrick perform \"Not Like Us\" once, he performed it a total of six times, opting to run it back each time after the crowd scream-sang \"A MINORRRRRRRRRRR\" (if you know, you know).\n\nAnd as if the night needed to end on a more legendary note, in between the repeats of the song, Kendrick brought up a handful of the artists that performed previously, NBA legends like Russel Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan and a number (alleged) members of various gangs in L.A., namely the Bloods, Crips, and other sets. Though initially unorganized, the \"Loyalty\" rapper somehow wrangled together the whole group for a large group photo that will no doubt serve as epic album cover (you already know it's coming) and a marker for peace for a myriad of groups who many thought couldn't be all under the same roof peacefully for years.\n\n\"Let them see this,\" he said at one point. \"We put this together with peace...I promise this won't be the last of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nKendrick Lamar added a whole new line to his Drake diss track \"Euphoria\", as he performed during his \"Pop Out\" concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday night (19 June).\n\nThe rapper's feud with the Canadian star has escalated in recent months, with the two hip-hop titans trading barbs over each other's physical appearance, talent, allegations of paedophilia and claims of secret children in a series of diss tracks.\n\nOpening the set on \"Euphoria\", Lamar threw in the new line: \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nIt references the ring previously owned by late rapper Tupac Shakur, purchased at an auction by an undisclosed buyer who last year was revealed to be Drake.\n\nShakur wore the custom, self-designed crown ring set with rubies and diamonds on his left ring finger while making what would be his final appearance at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, just over a week before he was killed during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, aged 25.\n\nThe ring had \"Pac & Dada 1996\" engraved on the band, referencing his engagement to actor Kidada Jones.\n\nDrake confirmed he was the mystery buyer when he posted a photo of the ring to an Instagram Story, with auction house Sotheby's also confirming he was behind the \u00a31m sale.\n\nIn April, Lamar blasted Drake for using an AI-generated version of Tupac on a since-deleted diss track, asking: \"Am I battlin' ghost or AI?\"\n\nThe new lyric from Lamar is just the latest instalment in their beef, from which he was widely agreed to have emerged the winner. Another diss track, \"Not Like Us\", is still riding high in the charts after debuting at No 1 in May.\n\nLamar welcomed guest stars including Dr Dre, Tyler, the Creator, Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock for the show, which was live streamed by Amazon Music and its hip-hop and R&B brand Rotation.\n\nThe show's title of The Pop Out: Ken and Friends took its name from a line on \"Not Like Us\" where he raps: \"Sometimes you gotta pop out and show n****s/ Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em.\"\n\nWhile the feud appeared to cool off after a series of intruders tried to break into Drake's home, the \"One Dance\" artist appeared to reference the battle during his guest verse on Sexyy Red's \"U My Everything\" last month.\n\nOn the track, he raps over Metro Boomin's \"BBL Drizzy\" beat, which the producer released online and told followers to make their own version of the song.\n\nMetro previously featured on Kendrick's early diss \"Like That\" in March. The \"BBL Drizzy\" title alludes to rumours that Drake underwent a \"Brazilian Butt Lift\" surgery.\n\n\"Me and the surgeon got history / I changed a lot of girls' lives for real, they need a new body, they hittin' me,\" Drake raps on Sexyy Red's song, as the beach switches to Metro's \"BBL Drizzy.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

Moreover, the show was a celebration of all things West Coast, but some rappers that have repped Los Angeles all the way did not appear for unknown and likely innocent reasons. However, one MC who didn't attend might have more reason to avoid an appearance, and that's The Game. Social media began to theorize on why he wasn't there, especially considering that he and K.Dot have had a pretty good and stable relationship over the years.\n\nStill, some factors have always interfered with this perception, such as past claims of jealousy and, most notably and recently, The Game's apparent support of Drake during the latter's beef with Kendrick Lamar this year. In fact, he even dissed Rick Ross, who supported Ken against his formerly close colleague Drizzy, so a lot of fans assumed that the Los Angeles spitter sided with his city's opposition this time around. Regardless of whether this was intentional or not, there honestly aren't a whole lot of solid indicators that he actually picked a side. The closest thing we got to that was a social media post playing The Boy's \"Energy,\" which was enough confirmation for many.\n\nRead More: Kendrick Lamar Really Popped Out: The West Coast Is Back On Top\n\nMeanwhile, this is what The Game had to say a few years ago about his exclusion from 2022's Super Bowl halftime show, which hosted many Los Angeles artists including Kendrick Lamar. \"I was hurt by that,\" he told I Am Athlete's Brandon Marshall. \"The real reason I wasn't on the Super Bowl is because I'm not a 'safe' artist. You don't know what the Game gon' do when he get up there. So, it's just like, 'He not safe,' so they went with the safe artists.\n\n\"We, on the West Coast, are the only motherf***ers who have this crab-in-a-barrel mentality, where we wanna keep n***as down,\" The Game claimed. \"Snoop Dogg is icon. Dre is icon [he popped out for the Kendrick Lamar show, too]. Em is an icon, but Em is not from L.A. 50 is not from L.A. I'm not taking away from the fact that they were on the Super Bowl, but L.A.

He also met Dave Free, who became his hype man and evolved into his business partner. After he dropped his debut mixtape Youngest Head Nigga in Charge, Lamar landed his life-changing record deal with Top Dawg Entertainment. He graduated high school in 2006 and went to college, but dropped out to focus on his music career. Lamar dropped four mixtapes and built a cult following under his original stage name. He started going by his birth name after he dropped his debut, self-titled EP in 2009.\n\nKendrick Lamar started to gain more mainstream appeal in 2010 following the release of his mixtape Overly Dedicated. The tape featured plenty of notable talent like The Roots, who produced the intro \"The Heart Part 2,\" plus other artists like Jhene Aiko, BJ The Chicago Kid, and his labelmates ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. The following year he dropped his debut album Section.80, which propelled him into superstardom.\n\nLamar ascended to the top of Hip-Hop's hierarchy with four more studio albums including good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), To Pimp A Butterfly (2015), DAMN. (2017), and his most recent LP Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers (2022). He also dropped a compilation album Untitled Unmastered in 2016 -- which consists of unreleased tracks from his TPAB recording sessions -- and curated the Black Panther soundtrack in 2018. Over the years, he's won 17 Grammy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award.\n\nIn 2019, Kendrick Lamar and Whitney Alford welcomed their first child, a girl named Uzi, into the world. The following year, Kendrick Lamar launched his company pgLang with Dave Free. When he released Mr. Morale in 2022, Lamar debuted his young daughter and revealed his newborn son Enoch on the album cover. Once the LP dropped, Lamar fulfilled his contractual obligations to Top Dawg and focused on his own imprint. The first song to officially drop through the company was \"The Hillbillies\" with his cousin Baby Keem.\n\nHis 37th birthday comes a month after he took on Drake in their epic rap battle, and a few days before his highly-anticipated show in L.A. on Juneteenth. Fans expect to celebrate his born day, and watch him perform diss tracks like \"Not Like Us\" for the first time live.\n\nHappy birthday Kendrick Lamar!", "source": {"uri": "iheart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iHeartRadio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_m_centeno@iheart.com", "name": "Tony M.

However, it appears all is good.\n\nCheck out Kendrick Lamar's fianc\u00e9e Whitney Alford and their kids watching The Pop Out - Ken & Friends show below.", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hippy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Hippy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop Out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mustard (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_Ricch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roddy Ricch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Lacy_(saxophonist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Lacy (saxophonist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Dolla_Sign", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Dolla Sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Historical_Anomalies_and_Revisionism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Historical Anomalies and Revisionism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Social", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Social", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/06/attachment-Kendrick-Lamar-Fiancee-Kids.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 234, "textEnd": 241}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Angeles, CA -\n\nKendrick Lamar has told Drake that he wants 2Pac's ring back for the West Coast.\n\nDuring his explosive \"Pop Out\" concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday night (June 19), K.Dot made the demand while performing his diss track \"Euphoria.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nKendrick changed the lyrics to the song and rapped: \"Give me 2Pac's ring back and I might give you a little respect.\"\n\nOn the original version of the track, he said: \"Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage/ I'd rather do that than let a Canadian n-gga make 'Pac turn in his grave.\"\n\nThe ring Kendrick Lamar is referring to is a piece of jewelry Drake bought at auction last year for over $1 million that belonged to 2Pac before he died.\n\nThe ring is made of gold, ruby and diamonds, and features an inscription that reads: \"Pac & Dada 1996,\" referencing the late rapper's engagement to his girlfriend Kidada Jones.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\n2Pac famously wore the ring during his final public appearance at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, just days before he was tragically killed at the age of 25 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile the identity of the winning bidder was initially kept a secret, Drake later revealed that he was in fact the buyer of the ring, which became the most valuable Hip Hop artifact ever sold at auction.\n\nThe Her Loss hitmaker posted a close-up photo on his Instagram Stories of him wearing the regal ring.\n\nThat wasn't the only shot Kendrick Lamar took at Drake during the epic concert on Wednesday.\n\nAs well as performing his diss track \"Not Like Us\" several times along with an introduction from Dr. Dre, he said: \"Y'all ain't gonna let anyone disrespect the West Coast or mock our legends,\" referring to the A.I. recreation of his voice for \"Taylor Made Freestyle.\"\n\nDespite the demand from Kendrick Lamar, Drake has been vocal about his 2Pac love in the past.\n\nHe previously bought a pair of matching custom chains dedicated to the late rapper from Jason of Beverly Hills.\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nThe chains each featured a pendant of Pac -- one of him wearing a blue bandana and diamond crown of thorns, and the other with a red bandana and gold crown of thorns.", "source": {"uri": "hiphopdx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HipHopDX"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Artists Together For Juneteenth Show, Playing Drake Diss Track \"Not Like Us\" Five Times", "body": "\"This is unity, y'all just don't know man,\" Lamar said as a group photo captured the more than 25 artists from across L.A. who performed at the show while instructing everybody on stage to say, \"One West.\"\n\n\"Everybody got fallen sons but we're right here, right now celebrating all of them, this shit is special,\" he added.\n\nAmong the friends who performed at the show -- held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, which simultaneously streamed on Amazon -- were Tyler, the Creator, YG, Roddy Ricch, Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy and Steve Lacy, who came out during a set curated by L.A. producer DJ Mustard, who also held a moment in memory of slain Crenshaw rapper Nipsey Hussle. During his set, Lamar reunited with Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock, with whom he'd formed the hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy under the Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) record label in 2008. He also brought out Dr. Dre who performed \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"California Love\" before he teed up Lamar's grand finale performance of the viral Drake diss \"Not Like Us\" by whispering the intro line, \"I see dead people.\"\n\nLamar went on to rap the track an additional four times, stating in between the encore performances, \"Y'all ain't gonna let anyone disrespect the West Coast huh? Oh y'all ain't gonna let nobody mock or imitate our legends huh?\" as he drew out one of the standout lyrics of the song, \"Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor\" - a double entendre playing off of an earlier reference in the track that alleges Drake likes underage girls -- with each refrain.\n\nMomentum for Lamar's first live performance of the diss had been building throughout the night as the crowd began chanting \"OV-hoe\" -- another lyric from \"Not Like Us\" -- at various points in the evening. Early on, Lamar remixed one of the lyrics to \"Euphoria,\" with a new jab toward Drake, reciting, \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect.\" He also rapped his verse to Future and Metro Boomin's single \"Like That,\" which was the impetus for the current rap beef. Outside of those targeted moments, Lamar kept the energy up during his set with renditions of hits such as \"M.A.A.d City,\" \"Be Humble,\" \"DNA.,\" \"Element.,\" \"Money Trees,\" \"Swimming Pools,\" \"King Kunta\" and \"King's Dead.\"\n\nThe night began with opening performances by 15 local L.A. acts alongside L.A.'s DJ Hed. The lineup, which included Ray Vaughn, Cuzzos, Westside Boogie, Zoe Osama, RJMRLA, OhGeesy, and Jason Martin, underscored the purpose of the Juneteenth showcase.\n\n\"Let them see this,\" Lamar said as he reunited performers across various L.A. neighborhoods and affiliations on stage at the end of the concert. \"We put this together with peace... I promise this won't be the last of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri":

During the show's finale, he came onstage to showcase his dance moves and was even joined by Demar Derozan who used to play for Drake's hometown team, the Toronto Raptors.\n\nDrake previously tried to claim Kendrick and his fianc\u00e9 Whitney Alford were having issues, but she was front and center at the concern supporting her man along with their two children.\n\nJames Harden and Rick Ross were also spotted in the crowd enjoying the show.\n\nThe event, which was advertised for all ages, brought out the likes of celebrity kids like North West who showed up to celebrate with Kenny.\n\nChloe Bailey was also seen at The Forum singing \"Not Like Us\" word for word.\n\nLast but not least, we can't forget all the local homies Kenny brought out including Tommy the Clown, the creator of the Clowning/Krumping movement.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_williams@bossip.com", "name": "Noah Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chloe Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Matters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/06/1718873309787.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1&strip=all&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles natives Russell Westbrook and DeMar Derozan came out on stage singing and dancing to all FIVE renditions of Lamar's diss track 'Not Like Us,' directed at Drake.\n\n'The Pop Out', hosted by Kendrick Lamar and every West Coast rapper seemingly on Earth, was less a concert and more a victory lap, putting people on to West Coast rappers while giving Lamar the time to go through his entire setlist of songs that include direct or shaded shots at Drake. It was a moment, an event that put the West Coast right in front of everyone in the world.\n\nIt was also a chance for West Coast icons such as Westbrook and Derozan to show up and show out in their home. Getting DeRozan there felt like a given, because of Lamar's line in 'Not Like Us': \"I'm glad DeRoz came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither, from Alondra down to Central n**** better not speak on Serena.\" DeRoz is obviously DeRozan, who was traded out of Toronto in the Kawhi Leonard deal, but is known as an icon with the Raptors. However, he's even more known for being from Compton, a West Coast dude at heart. Getting him up on the stage when Lamar called all of the West Coast icons and rappers up to the stage was an awesome moment, as well as getting Westbrook up there.\n\nRuss looked like he was having the time of his life. He looked like he was having more fun up on stage than he was at any time with the Clippers this season.\n\nWhile Westbrook and DeRozan are obviously big hits to Drake's rep in the NBA (which he very deeply cares about), neither of them will equal the final NBA player spotted at The Pop Out on Wednesday.\n\nTake the L out of Certified Lover Boy, it's Certified OVER Boy.\n\nThis is the greatest victory lap of all time, and getting all the NBA players out there was just another chance to dance on the grave.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_acosta@sbnation.com", "name": "Joseph Acosta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_the_L_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Take the L (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Lover_Boy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certified Lover Boy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPu8wXDw3pGkCguNfZdS_LpgRBk=/0x0:2134x1067/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25498989/Screenshot_2024_06_20_at_10.12.22_AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Kendrick has previously criticized Drake's acquisitions of iconic items from other artists as well, such as Pharrell's jewelry which Drake flaunted in his \"Family Matters\" video.\n\nKendrick's disdain for Drake's use of artificial intelligence to mimic 2Pac's voice in his \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" was also palpable as he performed \"Not Like Us\" repeatedly, emphasizing his protective stance over 2Pac's legacy.\n\nAs the dust settles on this monumental event, it's clear that Kendrick Lamar's respect for 2Pac isn't just about nostalgia -- it's a statement on the ethics and legacy of

Timothy Norris/Getty Images for pgLang, Amazon/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\ntoggle caption Timothy Norris/Getty Images for pgLang, Amazon/Getty Images North America\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar released Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers in 2022, he was jittery with agitation. There were many reasons within the songs for him to be anxious, which spend hard-earned therapy hours working through trauma, but he seemed most perplexed by those outside of his process seeking his voice in their struggles. His perceived silence during the dog days of activism in the early pandemic was met with questions and criticism, and in the face of those broader discussions, he made clear he would not be goaded into action. On \"Savior,\" he responded: \"The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior,\" later adding, \"I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people / They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking / And they like to wonder where I've been / Protecting my soul in the valley of silence.\" He did not want the burden of speaking for the culture, and felt it wasn't in his job description.\n\nWe as listeners are not entitled to any artist sounding off, especially when they are protecting their souls, and while it is fair to ask a socially aware rapper to use his platform as a megaphone for the issues bearing down on his community, I think often of the 2004 Dave Chappelle joke about Ja Rule and 9/11: We don't need everyone to talk about everything; sometimes they aren't equipped. Everything is political, but music is not politics. Songs are just songs unless actively weaponized. Kendrick was right in the sense that his raps, while galvanizing, could not save the people moved by them. And yet, the sharpness of his rebuttal felt nearly antagonistic coming from the rapper who talked about a trip to South Africa giving him awareness and pride, who stared down Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera and who made \"Alright.\"\n\nTellingly, Kendrick did not perform a single song off of Mr. Morale at \"The Pop Out,\" his Juneteenth event last night at the Forum in Los Angeles, live-streamed by Amazon Music. The energy wouldn't have fit the experience, which was not about avoiding the onus but sharing the platform. The significance of the occasion brought certain expectations: the Compton rapper embracing the moment in a way that he had not previously, speaking more directly to and for the \"we\" of \"Alright\" and \"Not Like Us.\" But in a grander sense, he seemed to be after a different kind of community organizing. The show quickly began to feel like a cookout he was sponsoring, where names like Remble and G Perico were familiar and welcome. Several generations of LA rappers made guest appearances, and Kendrick repeatedly talked about cultivating the new generation, hoping to sustain West Coast hip-hop across the next two decades. In his time of ascension, the most fearsome rapper working made a coalition of his crusade.\n\nThe event was broken up into three \"& Friends\" sets that seemed to build upon one another. After a DJ Hed set that brought out a colorful cast of lesser-known LA fixtures (Remble, Westside Boogie, RJMrLA, BlueBucksClan, Ohgeesy), \"Not Like Us\" architect Mustard, a pivotal West Coast player in his own right, set the tone for the rest of the night, the crowd reacting gleefully as the producer escorted noted locals through a handful of hits apiece. Some of those guests came with personal history: Mustard pointed out that Ty Dolla $ign taught him how to make beats before they launched into a song built on one of the first beats Mustard ever made, \"Paranoid.\" Later, before leaping through a mini-set with longtime partner in crime YG, he waxed nostalgic about living across from the Forum long before they got on, working on the album that would break things open for both of them, My Krazy Life. Blog-era staples (Dom Kennedy) rubbed shoulders with chart-topping anomalies (Roddy Ricch), and there were particularly grand receptions for two artists on the outer edges of the LA hip-hop scene: the guitarist turned surprise sensation Steve Lacy and the Odd Future auteur Tyler, the Creator.\n\nThe \"friends\" Kendrick had in mind for his own circling of the bases seemed to consider the team-building that made his run possible. Mid-set he reunited the original TDE foursome Black Hippy -- Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, ScHoolBoy Q and himself -- by bringing each rapper up individually to receive a well-earned salute from the crowd. The gesture was cathartic for a certain kind of rap fan. Kendrick cut ties with TDE in 2020 to start pgLang with former label co-president Dave Free; he hasn't made a song with another Black Hippy member in years. But rounding up the gang and taking a little tour of a few songs from the glory days seemed to bring an almost childlike delight out of him -- playing hype man for Jay Rock during \"Win,\" which is like stadium catnip, and the freaky Mike WiLL joint \"King's Dead,\" and teaming up with Q for the hard-bopping \"Collard Greens.\" (The reunion's deep sense of camaraderie could have only been improved by an impromptu run-through of the \"Black Lip Bastard\" remix.) When Kendrick rocked \"King Kunta,\" the others danced around the stage like no one was watching, with the that's my jam! Enthusiasm of a favorite song suddenly spilling out of a boombox.\n\nThis symbolic act, gathering the pillars of one of rap's most important indie movements of the last 25 years, was clearly a microcosm of the evening's larger theme of cross-color solidarity: coming together in awe of what was built collectively, and looking to its foundations as evidence of a monument whose peaks could reach even higher. \"This is unity at its finest,\" Kendrick said at one point, having brought dozens of Los Angeles figures onto the stage for a group photo that called to mind 2005's \"Great Day\" shoot in Atlanta and the 1958 Harlem jazz roundup that inspired it. \"For all of us to be together onstage, that s*** is special. Everybody on this stage got fallen soldiers.\" But it was hard to overlook the fact that the thing unifying the coast in this moment was not love but hate, and Kendrick, the self-proclaimed biggest Drake hater, was primarily operating in his capacity as speaker for the culture in his personal war with the Toronto high roller. If the matter wasn't settled before, then it certainly is now.\n\nIn that light, it was striking how many lines from old Kendrick songs now read like disses, in the context of a show that often played like a block party interrupting a wake. As Kendrick paraded the audience through hallmarks of his career -- his first hit (\"Swimming Pools\"), his first No. 1 (\"HUMBLE.\"), his blockbuster soundtrack (\"King's Dead\"), his American anthem (\"Alright\") -- he was also taking them on a guided tour past a corpse, and so every time a lyric rang off that matched the tenor of his animosity, the words felt retroactively prescient. \"Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand / Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman.\" \"I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter, what the f*** happened?\" \"You ain't really wild, you a tourist.\" \"I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton.\" I kept seeing Drake's face in so many of the verses. Of course, the targeted diss tracks were right there in the rotation, in conversation with Kendrick's rise to top dawg. Choosing violence, he opened with \"Euphoria\" and performed every Drake diss except \"Meet the Grahams.\" Each one punctuated an otherwise raucous set full of crowd pleasers that crescendoed into a performance of \"California Love\" with Dr. Dre. When Dre paused his exit from the stage to utter the words \"I see dead people,\" it felt like the spark setting off a powder keg that had been waiting to blow all night long. Kendrick, sensing the moment, did not let it slip past him.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" commanded its own portion of the show, where it rang out like a clarion call. He played the song five times in a row, each rendition more jubilant than the last. When he ran it back the first time, after holding onto the \"A minor\" line for dear life, he let the crowd rap the verse word-for-word as he bobbed around the stage, encouraging them to shout \"Certified Lover Boy, certified pedophile\" and drag that vowel to the moon and back. By the fourth run, Mustard had led a convoy of people onto the stage. As they came streaming to Kendrick's side, the camera caught several of their faces: many of the performers from across the day, the NBA stars DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook, the radio host Big Boy. The effect was the sensation that all Los Angeles was on stage with him -- \"Bloods, Crips, Pirus,\" as he put it. \"Show the world this.\" By the time they took that group photo, it seemed as if they had.\n\nWhen \"The Pop Out\" was all over, \"Win\" felt like the most fitting summation of the night. The song's battle cry -- \"You either with me or against me, ho!\" -- rang true for a rapper who had seemingly rallied the entire world, its ultimatum answered in the overwhelming support shown for his cause on this day. It was a resounding win for him, of course, but the night also felt like a win for regional music, its distinct style and sound and swagger, a win for an unscalable kind of hip-hop that is supposedly being blotted out by more centrist hip-pop, and a win for the culture, which Kendrick is so adamant about speaking for now.

There were many reasons within the songs for him to be anxious, which spend hard-earned therapy hours working through trauma, but he seemed most perplexed by those outside of his process seeking his voice in their struggles. His perceived silence during the dog days of activism in the early pandemic was met with questions and criticism, and in the face of those broader discussions, he made clear he would not be goaded into action. On \"Savior,\" he responded: \"The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior,\" later adding, \"I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people / They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking / And they like to wonder where I've been / Protecting my soul in the valley of silence.\" He did not want the burden of speaking for the culture, and felt it wasn't in his job description.\n\nWe as listeners are not entitled to any artist sounding off, especially when they are protecting their souls, and while it is fair to ask a socially aware rapper to use his platform as a megaphone for the issues bearing down on his community, I think often of the 2004 Dave Chappelle joke about Ja Rule and 9/11: We don't need everyone to talk about everything; sometimes they aren't equipped. Everything is political, but music is not politics. Songs are just songs unless actively weaponized. Kendrick was right in the sense that his raps, while galvanizing, could not save the people moved by them. And yet, the sharpness of his rebuttal felt nearly antagonistic coming from the rapper who talked about a trip to South Africa giving him awareness and pride, who stared down Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera and who made \"Alright.\"\n\nTellingly, Kendrick did not perform a single song off of Mr. Morale at \"The Pop Out,\" his Juneteenth event last night at the Forum in Los Angeles, live-streamed by Amazon Music. The energy wouldn't have fit the experience, which was not about avoiding the onus but sharing the platform. The significance of the occasion brought certain expectations: the Compton rapper embracing the moment in a way that he had not previously, speaking more directly to and for the \"we\" of \"Alright\" and \"Not Like Us.\" But in a grander sense, he seemed to be after a different kind of community organizing. The show quickly began to feel like a cookout he was sponsoring, where names like Remble and G Perico were familiar and welcome. Several generations of LA rappers made guest appearances, and Kendrick repeatedly talked about cultivating the new generation, hoping to sustain West Coast hip-hop across the next two decades. In his time of ascension, the most fearsome rapper working made a coalition of his crusade.\n\nThe event was broken up into three \"& Friends\" sets that seemed to build upon one another. After a DJ Hed set that brought out a colorful cast of lesser-known LA fixtures (Remble, Westside Boogie, RJMrLA, BlueBucksClan, Ohgeesy), \"Not Like Us\" architect Mustard, a pivotal West Coast player in his own right, set the tone for the rest of the night, the crowd reacting gleefully as the producer escorted noted locals through a handful of hits apiece. Some of those guests came with personal history: Mustard pointed out that Ty Dolla $ign taught him how to make beats before they launched into a song built on one of the first beats Mustard ever made, \"Paranoid.\" Later, before leaping through a mini-set with longtime partner in crime YG, he waxed nostalgic about living across from the Forum long before they got on, working on the album that would break things open for both of them, My Krazy Life. Blog-era staples (Dom Kennedy) rubbed shoulders with chart-topping anomalies (Roddy Ricch), and there were particularly grand receptions for two artists on the outer edges of the LA hip-hop scene: the guitarist turned surprise sensation Steve Lacy and the Odd Future auteur Tyler, the Creator.\n\nThe \"friends\" Kendrick had in mind for his own circling of the bases seemed to consider the team-building that made his run possible. Mid-set he reunited the original TDE foursome Black Hippy -- Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, ScHoolBoy Q and himself -- by bringing each rapper up individually to receive a well-earned salute from the crowd. The gesture was cathartic for a certain kind of rap fan. Kendrick cut ties with TDE in 2020 to start pgLang with former label co-president Dave Free; he hasn't made a song with another Black Hippy member in years. But rounding up the gang and taking a little tour of a few songs from the glory days seemed to bring an almost childlike delight out of him -- playing hype man for Jay Rock during \"Win,\" which is like stadium catnip, and the freaky Mike WiLL joint \"King's Dead,\" and teaming up with Q for the hard-bopping \"Collard Greens.\" (The reunion's deep sense of camaraderie could have only been improved by an impromptu run-through of the \"Black Lip Bastard\" remix.) When Kendrick rocked \"King Kunta,\" the others danced around the stage like no one was watching, with the that's my jam! Enthusiasm of a favorite song suddenly spilling out of a boombox.\n\nThis symbolic act, gathering the pillars of one of rap's most important indie movements of the last 25 years, was clearly a microcosm of the evening's larger theme of cross-color solidarity: coming together in awe of what was built collectively, and looking to its foundations as evidence of a monument whose peaks could reach even higher. \"This is unity at its finest,\" Kendrick said at one point, having brought dozens of Los Angeles figures onto the stage for a group photo that called to mind 2005's \"Great Day\" shoot in Atlanta and the 1958 Harlem jazz roundup that inspired it. \"For all of us to be together onstage, that s*** is special. Everybody on this stage got fallen soldiers.\" But it was hard to overlook the fact that the thing unifying the coast in this moment was not love but hate, and Kendrick, the self-proclaimed biggest Drake hater, was primarily operating in his capacity as speaker for the culture in his personal war with the Toronto high roller. If the matter wasn't settled before, then it certainly is now.\n\nIn that light, it was striking how many lines from old Kendrick songs now read like disses, in the context of a show that often played like a block party interrupting a wake. As Kendrick paraded the audience through hallmarks of his career -- his first hit (\"Swimming Pools\"), his first No. 1 (\"HUMBLE.\"), his blockbuster soundtrack (\"King's Dead\"), his American anthem (\"Alright\") -- he was also taking them on a guided tour past a corpse, and so every time a lyric rang off that matched the tenor of his animosity, the words felt retroactively prescient. \"Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand / Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman.\" \"I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter, what the f*** happened?\" \"You ain't really wild, you a tourist.\" \"I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton.\" I kept seeing Drake's face in so many of the verses. Of course, the targeted diss tracks were right there in the rotation, in conversation with Kendrick's rise to top dawg. Choosing violence, he opened with \"Euphoria\" and performed every Drake diss except \"Meet the Grahams.\" Each one punctuated an otherwise raucous set full of crowd pleasers that crescendoed into a performance of \"California Love\" with Dr. Dre. When Dre paused his exit from the stage to utter the words \"I see dead people,\" it felt like the spark setting off a powder keg that had been waiting to blow all night long. Kendrick, sensing the moment, did not let it slip past him.\n\n\"Not Like Us\" commanded its own portion of the show, where it rang out like a clarion call. He played the song five times in a row, each rendition more jubilant than the last. When he ran it back the first time, after holding onto the \"A minor\" line for dear life, he let the crowd rap the verse word-for-word as he bobbed around the stage, encouraging them to shout \"Certified Lover Boy, certified pedophile\" and drag that vowel to the moon and back. By the fourth run, Mustard had led a convoy of people onto the stage. As they came streaming to Kendrick's side, the camera caught several of their faces: many of the performers from across the day, the NBA stars DeMar DeRozan and Russell Westbrook, the radio host Big Boy. The effect was the sensation that all Los Angeles was on stage with him -- \"Bloods, Crips, Pirus,\" as he put it. \"Show the world this.\" By the time they took that group photo, it seemed as if they had.\n\nWhen \"The Pop Out\" was all over, \"Win\" felt like the most fitting summation of the night. The song's battle cry -- \"You either with me or against me, ho!\" -- rang true for a rapper who had seemingly rallied the entire world, its ultimatum answered in the overwhelming support shown for his cause on this day. It was a resounding win for him, of course, but the night also felt like a win for regional music, its distinct style and sound and swagger, a win for an unscalable kind of hip-hop that is supposedly being blotted out by more centrist hip-pop, and a win for the culture, which Kendrick is so adamant about speaking for now. Sometimes it just takes the right opportunity.", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While it doesn't appear that the former Aftermath is bothered by being excluded from the show, fans on X are speculating that the artist born Jayceon Taylor was left off the bill due to his alignment with Drake.\n\nBack in April, Game posted a video of him listening to Drizzy's \"Energy\" track which some took to mean he was on the side of the so-called 6 God. In the now-deleted post, fans blasted Game for seemingly going against his fellow Compton native in Lamar although the rapper never publicly chose a side.\n\nStill, the optics of it all have fans believing this is why Game, a capable rapper despite what some might say, was not part of the epic cameo performances that included the likes of YG, TDE mainstays Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and ScHoolby Q, and others.\n\nOn X, the jokes are flying about The Game now appearing on the bill and we've got the best we could find below.", "source": {"uri": "hiphopwired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Latest Hip-Hop News, Music and Media | Hip-Hop Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_strong@hiphopwired.com", "name": "Lance Strong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Game (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab-Soul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ab-Soul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Dawg_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Dawg Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/06/17188993736232-e1718899505789.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Unifies The Culture", "body": "Usher Details The Extensive Routine To Maintain His Physique, Including No Food On Wednesdays\n\nThe West Coast, specifically Los Angeles, got something to say, and that was proven on Juneteenth (June 19) at Kendrick Lamar's The Pop Out.\n\nThe concert was held at the Kia Forum in the heart of Inglewood. People pulled up in droves early to be present and on time for what would become a historic moment in music, Hip-Hop, and for the culture.\n\n\"Tonight is a celebration of what makes the left coast the best coast [...] and the unification of the west,\" E-40 narrated as the show began. Divided into three acts, DJ Hed commanded the crowd first and brought out special guests: Remble, Ray Vaughn, Cuzzos, Rucci, AzChike, Jay Worthy & Meet The Whoops, Wallie The Sensei, Westside Boogie, Zoe Osama, Kalan.FrFr, G. Perico, Bino Rideaux, BlueBucksClan, RJMrLA, Ohgeesy, JasonMartin (formerly known as Problem), and the legendary Tommy The Clown with his T-Squad.\n\nEven though each act seemingly performed one song in an effort to remain on schedule, the crowd's energy was already on high as they awaited K. Dot's set.\n\nMustard pulled up to the scene ready to party. He cascaded through his catalog of hits including Tyga's \"Rack City,\" 2 Chainz's \"I'm Different,\" Kid Ink and Chris Brown's \"Show Me,\" and Big Sean's \"I Don't F**k With You\" before being joined by the likes of 310babii, Blxst, Ty Dolla $ign, Roddy Ricch, and Steve Lacy.\n\nFor the first time, the famed producer and Dom Kennedy performed his cult classic, \"When I Come Around.\" Not to mention, the crowd went berserk when Tyler, The Creator popped out. Of the moment, the rapper tweeted, \"It was beautiful to see the whole city come together last night. My first raps were written at home off Crenshaw Dr and 82nd, right down the street from the Forum. Thank you. Shoutout FREE LUNCH.\"\n\nMustard took a moment to pay tribute to the late Nipsey Hussle before YG took the stage, closing out act two.\n\nThe crowd was chanting \"OVH*E\" before the arena went dark and Kendrick took the stage. As predicted by fans on Twitter, he kicked off his almost 90-minute performance with an altered version of his diss track, \"euphoria.\" Kung Fu Kenny added the line, \"Give me Tupac's ring back and I might give you a little respect,\" which was in direct reference to Drake buying Pac's custom crown ring in a recent auction.\n\nKendrick also rocked a fit that was eerily similar to Pac's look from the 1994 Source Awards.\n\nHe restarted the track three times after finishing the first verse, \"Why you trollin' like a b***h? Ain't you tired? Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"\n\nAt one point, he was joined by dancer Storm DeBarge and choreographer Charm La'Donna. Arguably, the best part of Kenny's set wasn't the five-peat of this diss record, but the gang unification. \"At this point it ain't got nothing to do with a song. It ain't nothing to do with any back-and-forth record. This is what it's about.\"\n\nKendrick declared, \"This s**t making me emotional. We been f**ked up since Nipsey died. We been f**ked up since Kobe died. Let the world see this.\"\n\nNot only did Kendrick unite different sets onstage, but it felt like all of Hollywood pulled up to celebrate him. Celebrity attendees included Rick Ross, James Harden, Chika, Kayla Nicole, LeBron and Savannah James, Chl\u00f6e, The Weeknd, Malcolm Mays, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan, and more.\n\nAll-in-all, Kendrick turned Juneteenth 2024 into a cultural reunion, which hasn't happened since Jadakiss performed \"New York\" at The Lox/Dipset VERZUZ in August 2021. Not only did the Pulitzer Prize winner take the crown in this rap battle, he reminded the world why Los Angeles Hip-Hop is essential to music, culture, and beyond. For that alone, we all won.\n\nCheck out more reactions below and snippets from his performance below.", "source": {"uri": "vibe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vibe"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Who are the cameos in Eminem's latest hit, Houdini: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and many more famous names\n\nLast Wenesday, rapper Kendrick Lamar organized a massive concert with all his rapper friends from the Los Angeles area that made headlines around the world. Many celebrities and famous athletes were there. One of the people who attended was Los Angeles Lakers star, LeBron James. Although the event was officially a get together of all the West Coast's greatest acts, it was also the perfect excuse for Kendrick Lamar to make thousands of people bully Drake with his 'Not Like Us' hit song. He played the song about five or six straight times and it was introduced by none other than Dr. Dre. Amongst the acts that performed in this event were YG, Tyler The Creator, Remble, and the doctor himself.\n\nWhen the hit song was playing, there was a moment where NBA stars James Harden, DeRozan, and Russell Westbrook were dancing on stage. But LeBron James was also in attendance and dancing to the music from his seat. As people may know, James has a great relationship with both Kendrick Lamar and Drake. So people started theorizing who the Lakers legend is aligned with during this very public rap battle. The concert that took place at the Kia Forum was a loud culmination of what many are already calling the greatest rap battle in history. But how can it be that great if it seems so one-sided? That's the question everybody is asking.\n\nWhether LeBron James picks one side or the other should not be under scrutiny, surely he will make the most Darwinian answer because he is a survivor. Staying on the right side of history is a natural instinct and LeBron James didn't want to miss the opportunity to witness a sublime moment in West Coast rap history. But that doesn't necessarily mean he is taking one side or the other. One can like both rappers and shouldn't be judged for it. If only more people understood that LeBron doesn't need to take a side in this battle, we would be living in a very different world.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Dre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler, the Creator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eminem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YG (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast hip hop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Sidesaddle", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/cef36f1bb12925e6f71a12439b57ade0/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/20/17189174333782.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663353", "eventUri": "eng-9663353", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 456618740, "relevance": 2}

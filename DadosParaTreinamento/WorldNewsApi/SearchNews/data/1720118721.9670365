{"id": 227491308, "title": "Stormy Daniels says Trump should be jailed or 'be a human punching bag'", "text": "Stormy Daniels has called for Donald Trump to be jailed after the former president was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The Republican presidential frontrunner will be sentenced on July 11, with a prison sentence being a potential but unlikely outcome. As a first-time offender for a nonviolent crime, Mr Trump is more likely to face a fine or probation. Mr Trump was found to have falsified business records to conceal payments related to an alleged affair with the porn star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cBeing in court was so intimidating with the jurors looking at you. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad that the stuff came out in court that wanted to come out and prove, like I said, I\u2019ve been telling the truth the entire time. \u201cIt\u2019s not over for me. It\u2019s never going to be over for me. Trump may be guilty, but I still have to live with the legacy.\u201d She added: \u201cI think he should be sentenced to jail and some community service working for the less fortunate, or being the volunteer punching bag at a women\u2019s shelter.\u201d Mr Trump could be placed under home confinement or subjected to a curfew rather than imprisoned and leading Republicans have already stated that not would stop him campaigning in the upcoming election against Joe Biden. Mr Biden has called his rival \u201cunhinged\u201d. After becoming the first former US president to be convicted, Mr Trump protested his innocence. \u201cThis was a disgrace,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who is corrupt\u201d. Ms Clifford claims to have had sex with Mr Trump in 2006 after a golf tournament, one year after he married his current wife Melania. Ten years later, Mr Trump\u2019s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, is said to have sought to pay her to remain silent about their affair. The 45-year-old former actress has come in for death threats since beginning her legal case against Mr Trump but says she has no regrets. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the sentencing could be or what Trump will even understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you have a child, and sometimes you take the electronics away from them, but if your child is very artistic, they don\u2019t. They don\u2019t care. They\u2019ll just go colour their colouring books, and then you have another child that, you know, they don\u2019t want to go outside. \u201cYou gotta ground them or take away electronics or don\u2019t let them have dessert. \u201cYou have to find the punishment that not just matches the crime, but is fair and just, and that impacts that particular person. Who knows what that is with Trump.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The Republican presidential frontrunner will be sentenced on July 11, with a prison sentence being a potential but unlikely outcome</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/us-politics/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-punishment-crime-conviction-b1161569.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/02/11/31/SEI206809896.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3c6DwdMf-MzYL9J7h.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:27:24", "author": "William Mata", "authors": ["William Mata"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.282}

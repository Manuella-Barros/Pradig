Not only can crows hold a grudge against humans, they can also bring us gifts, and even hold funerals when one of their flock dies. This year, however, scientists have learned that these clever little corvids can also count out loud! Yes, really. How crows count out loud A team of researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany found that crows can \u2018count\u2019 out loud by producing a specific and deliberate number of caws in response to visual and auditory clues. Science Daily said: \u201cWhile other animals such as honeybees have shown an ability to understand numbers, this specific manifestation of numeric literacy has not yet been observed in any other non-human species.\u201d Unbelievably exciting. In the paper, neuroscientist and lead researcher Diana Liao said: \u201cProducing a specific number of vocalisations with purpose requires a sophisticated combination of numerical abilities and vocal control. \u201cWhether this capacity exists in animals other than humans is yet unknown. We show that crows can flexibly produce variable numbers of one to four vocalisations in response to arbitrary cues associated with numerical values.\u201d How the crows counted Counting out loud is a separate skill to understanding numbers. It involves vocalising words, and communicating them to another. It\u2019s one of the early skills that we teach children. The researchers conducted their study on three crows which were trained to produce a variable number of vocalisations, between one and four, upon being shown an arbitrary symbol or audio cue. Once they had produced the requisite number of caws, the crows had to then peck a target to signify that they were done. All three crows, the researchers found, were able to produce the correct number of caws in response to the cues, with the occasional error mostly presenting as one caw too many or too few. The researchers said: \u201cOur results demonstrate that crows can flexibly and deliberately produce an instructed number of vocalisations by using the \u2018approximate number system\u2019, a non-symbolic number estimation system shared by humans and animals.\u201d Clever little corvids indeed!", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/665722c523000054008206f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"Daniel Alberto Garcia Martinez / 500px via Getty Images\" /></div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>If you weren\u2019t aware, crows are some of the most intelligent creatures in the animal kingdom.\u00a0</p><p>Not only can <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-1-disturbing-reason-you-should-befriend-a-crow_uk_66278d68e4b00ea555a4ef21\">crows hold a grudge against humans</a>, they can also bring us gifts, and <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504722/12-fascinating-facts-about-crows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even hold funerals</a> when one of their flock dies.\u00a0</p><p>This year, however, scientists have learned that these clever little corvids can also count out loud!</p><p>Yes, really.</p><h2><strong>How crows count out loud</strong></h2><p>A team of researchers at the <a href=\"https://uni-tuebingen.de/", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/scientists-have-revealed-this-incredibly-human-like-trait-in-crows-and-i-am-in-awe_uk_66570a10e4b0169dc758cebc", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/665722c523000054008206f9.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:22:24", "author": "Sarah-louise Kelly", "authors": ["Sarah-louise Kelly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.184}

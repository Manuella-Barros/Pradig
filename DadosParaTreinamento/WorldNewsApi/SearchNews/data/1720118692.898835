Dozens of World War II veterans are converging on France to revisit old memories, make new ones, and hammer home a message that survivors of D-Day and the ensuing Battle of Normandy, and of other World War II theaters, have repeated time and time again \u2014 that war is hell. \u201cSeven thousand of my marine buddies were killed. Twenty thousand shot up, wounded, put on ships, buried at sea,\u201d said Don Graves, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iwo Jima in the Pacific theater. \u201cI want the younger people, the younger generation here to know what we did,\u201d said Graves, part of a group of more than 60 World War II veterans who flew into Paris on Saturday. The youngest veteran in the group is 96 and the most senior 107, according to their carrier from Dallas, American Airlines. \u201cWe did our job and we came home and that\u2019s it. We never talked about it I think. For 70 years I didn\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said another of the veterans, Ralph Goldsticker, a U.S. Air Force captain who served in the 452nd Bomb Group. Of the D-Day landings, he recalled seeing from his aircraft \u201ca big, big chunk of the beach with thousands of vessels,\u201d and spoke of bombing raids against German strongholds and routes that German forces might otherwise have used to rush in reinforcements to push the invasion back into the sea. \u201cI dropped my first bomb at 06:58 a.m. in a heavy gun placement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went back home, we landed at 09:30. We reloaded.\u201d", "summary": "CARENTAN-LES-MARAIS, France (AP) &#8212; Parachutists jumping from World War II-era planes hurled themselves Sunday into now peaceful Normandy skies where war once raged, heralding a week of ceremonies for the fast-disappearing generation of Allied troops who fought from D-Day beaches 80 years ago to Adolf Hitler&#8217;s fall, helping free Europe of his tyranny.

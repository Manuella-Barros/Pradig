During its flight, Joby's prototype vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft released only water vapor as exhaust, showing the world that emission-free air travel is possible.\n\nThe aviation industry is responsible for 2.5 percent of global CO emissions, making it a major contributor to the climate emergency. Innovations like Joby's air demonstrator can prove to be a boon for both the environment and people. It has the potential to free our skies from the greenhouse gases released by regional flights and make air travel convenient for domestic travelers.\n\n\"We're excited to now be building a technology stack that could redefine regional travel using hydrogen-electric aircraft. Imagine being able to fly from San Francisco to San Diego, Boston to Baltimore, or Nashville to New Orleans without the need to go to an airport and with no emissions except water,\" JoeBen Bevirt, CEO and Founder of Joby Aviation, said.\n\nThe Joby Aviation team specializes in making battery-powered aircraft. They have conducted multiple successful electric flight tests during which their air taxis completed a total distance of over 25,000 miles.\n\nIn 2021, Joby Aviation acquired H2FLY, a German company working on making hydrogen fuel technology feasible for the aviation industry. Together, they converted one of Joby's eVTOLs into a hydrogen-electric aircraft. They removed a large number of batteries (though not all) from the eVTOL and installed a hydrogen fuel tank and fuel system designed by H2FLY.\n\nThe fuel tank can store 40 kg of liquid hydrogen. When hydrogen from the tank reaches the fuel cell system, it generates electricity, heat, and water. This electricity powers the six motors of Joby's air taxi during flight, while the remaining batteries supply the additional power needed for take-off and landing.\n\nThe hydrogen-electric air taxi demonstrator successfully covered a distance of 523 miles over Marina City in California on June 24. The fuel tank had 40 kg of liquid hydrogen before take-off and the aircraft still had 10 percent of fuel when it landed.\n\n\"The landmark test flight, believed to be the first forward flight of a vertical take-off and landing aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen, was completed last month. It landed with 10% of its hydrogen fuel load remaining,\" the Joby Aviation team notes.\n\nJoby is not the only company involved in the business of making air taxis. It is also not the first company to conduct flight tests using hydrogen fuel. However, there are certain features of their air taxi which make it different and more practical than others.\n\nFor example, they have designed their aircraft to produce low noise levels during takeoff, flight, and landing. This is very important because noise is a real concern in the context of these vehicles' operation.\n\nSuppose you book an air taxi early morning or at midnight for an urgent meeting. The taxi arrives on time but ends up waking up nearby people because of the noise of its engine and rotors.\n\nThe Joby Aviation team claims that their users won't face any such issues as their air taxis can land in a residential area without making much noise.\n\n\"From the beginning, we knew our aircraft had to fade into the background of life. Our expert team of engineers has dedicated years to delivering an aircraft that will be quiet enough to land in your neighborhood,\" the Joby Aviation team notes.\n\nThe company aims to start providing commercial electric air taxi service by 2025, and is currently waiting for FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) approval. However, it might take longer to launch their hydrogen-powered taxi operations due to regulatory challenges.", "source": {"uri": "zmescience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZME Science"},

The aircraft landed with 10% of its hydrogen fuel load remaining and had no in-flight emissions except water.\n\nLast week, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems - ARCHES - and the United States Department of Energy officially announced the signing of a landmark $12.6 billion agreement, including up to $1.2 billion from the DOE and $11.4 billion in public and private matching funds, to build and expand clean energy infrastructure across California.\n\n\"Traveling by air is central to human progress, but we need to find ways to make it cleaner,\" said Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt in a press release. \"With our battery-electric air taxi set to fundamentally change the way we move around cities, we're excited to now be building a technology stack that could redefine regional travel using hydrogen-electric aircraft.\"\n\nThe aviation company has designed and produced an electric air taxi that will carry a pilot and four passengers at speeds up to 200 mph offering high-speed mobility with a fraction of the noise produced by helicopters and zero operating emissions.\n\nJoby has been doing business and developing a manufacturing facility in Marina for about the past seven years where it launched production of its aircraft at its Pilot Production Plant with the first aircraft rolling off the line in June 2023. The Marina facility is one of three in California with others at Santa Cruz -- where the company is headquartered -- and San Carlos. Joby Aviation also has a facility in Munich and chose Dayton, Ohio, last year, as the site for its new manufacturing plant.\n\n\"The vast majority of the design, testing and certification work we've completed on our battery-electric aircraft carries over to commercializing hydrogen-electric flight,\" said Bevirt. \"In service, we also expect to be able to use the same landing pads, the same operations team and Joby's ElevateOS software that will support the commercial operation of our battery-electric aircraft.\"\n\nAccording to the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, California recently led the nation in multiple hydrogen-powered transportation innovations, with the world's first entirely hydrogen-powered ferry in San Francisco Bay and the successful 523-mile hydrogen-electric flight.\n\n\"Joby is a stellar example of why California continues to lead the world in clean technology and high-tech manufacturing,\" said Dee Dee Myers, senior advisor to Gov. Gavin Newsom and director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, in a press release. \"Their pioneering work to decarbonize aviation, by advancing battery and now hydrogen fuel cell technology, is helping to fight climate change and create a clean energy future that will improve the lives of all Californians.\"\n\nJoby's hydrogen-electric demonstrator is part of the Company's future technology program and is the result of several years of collaboration between a small team at Joby and H2FLY, Joby's wholly-owned subsidiary based in Stuttgart, Germany. The converted Joby aircraft previously completed more than 25,000 miles of testing as a battery-electric aircraft at Joby's facility in Marina.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, the California Hydrogen Hub spans across the state and will leverage the state's leadership in clean energy technology to produce hydrogen exclusively from renewable energy and biomass.\n\nRenewable energy sources include, solar, wind, and ocean, and biomass sources include agriculture residues, animal waste and algae.\n\nLast year, California was selected as a national hub. ARCHES is the first of seven Hydrogen Hubs throughout the country to officially sign their agreement with the DOE.\n\nThe ARCHES hub will facilitate a network of clean, renewable hydrogen production sites to cut fossil fuel use throughout California, with the ultimate goal of decarbonizing public transportation, heavy duty trucking, and port operations by 2 million metric tons per year - roughly the equivalent to annual emissions of 445,000 gasoline-fueled cars. The California Hydrogen Hub is expected to create an estimated 220,000 new jobs, including 130,000 in construction and 90,000 permanent jobs.", "source": {"uri": "montereyherald.com", "dataType":

The aircraft would be used for mid-range, regional travel.\n\nThe test flight was deemed successful, having shown that it is possible to use an existing electric aircraft and retrofit it to run on H2 fuel cells in order to boost the plane's range.\n\nJoby Aviation is one of a growing number of companies focusing on the use of H2 for regional flights. That said, it is in a notably smaller group of companies currently looking into the development of an air taxi service that would be capable of vertical takeoffs and landings.\n\nUntil very recently, Joby Aviation has placed its attention on the creation of fully battery electric aircraft. Those vehicles have a range closer to 100 miles and are geared toward transportation within cities or from various locations to larger airports.\n\nThe company tested its technology by using a pre-production prototype of one of its battery electric crafts and installed a liquid H2 fuel tank and system. The modified aircraft was able to successfully complete its test flight of 523 miles over Marina, California, emitting only water vapor. Upon landing, the aircraft still had 10 percent of the liquid H2 in its fuel tank.\n\nIn 2022, Joby Aviation acquired H2Fly, a hydrogen fuel powered aircraft startup. With that acquisition, it was able to branch out from battery electric vehicles to those powered by H2 as well.

To the aviation people flocking around the stand, it's so cool.\n\nAnd though that's a mock-up, Bevirt has made the technology real. Two of these machines are doing flight tests in California, near the manufacturing site south of Joby headquarters in Santa Cruz. Another is flying out of Edwards Air Force Base as the military assesses its potential.\n\nHe has more than 1,800 employees, about 80% of them engineers.\n\nThey've designed a machine that's lifted vertically by six large rotors, two on each wing and two on the V-shaped tail, and hovers. Once aloft, the rotors swivel to the horizontal to become propellers and the machine flies like a plane.\n\nPowered by lithium ion batteries, it is quiet. And there are no emissions. It can fly up to 100 miles, but most trips are expected to be much shorter, more like 20 miles.\n\nUber and Delta Air Lines are collaborating with Joby so that it can develop software that interacts with the Uber and Delta phone apps.\n\nThe idea is you book a flight to New York's Kennedy Airport and an Uber picks you up and takes you to the air taxi, which whisks you to the airport. The integrated software systems seamlessly connect your Uber trip on the ground to your air taxi flight.\n\nJoby hopes to begin service in Dubai by the end of next year. It has plans for service in New York City, Los Angeles and Florida.\n\nThis is clearly a serious effort backed by big-pocketed investors. But can it be made real? Listen to Bevirt's pitch as it grows in fervor.\n\n\"My dream is that significant portions of the population are moving around in the air on a daily basis,\" he says. \"Aviation is not just for going across the country, it's for being able to go across town.\"\n\nThen he deadpans: \"My mission is to save a billion people an hour a day.\"\n\nYes. His vision for that trip across Puget Sound is that lines of these machines would be constantly popping up into the air and crossing the water.\n\nThere would be takeoff and landing spots -- like helicopter pads, but called vertiports in this nascent air taxi world -- dotted all over Seattle and Eastside neighborhoods. And this would be replicated all over the world.\n\nThis will take decades, Bevirt concedes. But starting small, he says it will scale up to \"thousands, and then tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands\" of these flying, swarming air taxis.\n\nA billion people in flying cars.\n\nAnd beyond that, he wants eventually to develop hydrogen-powered air taxis that fly further. Joby just flew one of its machines, a prototype stuffed with a hydrogen fuel tank, more than 500 miles.\n\nThat could carry you from Seattle to Portland, without ever going through the rigors of Sea-Tac Airport, he said, \"from the suburb where you live in Seattle to the suburb where grandma lives in Portland.\"\n\nA different vision in Europe\n\nJoby, founded in 2009, is now a public company and its financial filings show it lost $1.6 billion over the last four years.\n\nYet it's the most advanced of the many air taxi startups, with multiple test flights flown and funding to keep it going as it works with the Federal Aviation Administration to get its vehicle certified.\n\nAt the end of the last quarter, it had $924 million left.\n\nStill, the cool technology Joby's engineers have produced may not be the determinant of whether the enterprise succeeds.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday at Farnborough, where multiple air taxi startups are displaying their wares, Christian Scherer was skeptical that Bevirt's dream will flourish. The CEO of Airbus Commercial said the technology to create a \"flying object\" is not the hard part.\n\nSpeaking as \"a manufacturer of flying objects,\" he said the more difficult challenge is to build the needed infrastructure.\n\nThe flights must be integrated into the current air-traffic management systems, the vehicle certified to aviation's high safety standards, and communities must work out the logistics of where it flies and where it lands.\n\n\"It's the ripeness and the readiness of it being operable, that's the key,\" said Scherer, doubtfully.\n\nJoby is the current leader in what is a wild startup environment with dozens of air taxi projects around the world, many with different, colliding ideas for this new business.\n\nKlaus Roewe, former veteran Airbus program leader and now CEO of Lilium, an air taxi startup based in Munich, made a surprising and vehement opening remark in an interview at Farnborough.\n\n\"We are not an air taxi,\" he insisted. \"I hate this term air taxi. An air taxi is a stupid thing that can fly with few people short ranges.\"\n\nLilium's vehicle -- let's this once call it a jet, as Roewe prefers -- is bigger than Joby's. It seats six people and flies farther, about 110 miles.\n\nHis vision is regional or intercity air travel. Orlando to Tampa. Austin to Houston. San Diego to L.A.\n\nHe said Europe, with so many populous cities relatively close together, will be the biggest market.\n\nAnd Lilium is also talking with Chinese authorities about connecting the huge cities around Hong Kong Bay: Shanghai, Guangzhou, Macao and Hong Kong.\n\nOne might get away with calling it a long-distance air taxi, though not in Roewe's presence.\n\nHis vehicle also looks very different from Joby's. Instead of rotors it has 30 small electric engines. They are ducted: enclosed in a pod like the engines on today's airliners.\n\nIn order to provide vertical lift the entire wing swivels, as does a smaller wing at the back called a canard.\n\nThis configuration requires much more power to lift off. The advantage, Roewe says, is in level flight.\n\n\"The aircraft is very clean and we don't have six or eight rotors standing in the wind,\" he said, allowing the aircraft to fly longer and further at higher speed.\n\nLilium is also public, and its filings show it has lost $1.4 billion since 2019 and finished last year with just $212 million left.\n\n\"Yes, we have a short cash runway,\" Roewe conceded. Lilium is in talks with both the French and German governments for funding to keep it going. Lilium would locate a production line in France if that comes through.\n\nOne detail inhibiting private investors from pumping in more money is that, unlike Joby, Lilium has not yet flown a full-scale model. It hopes to do so by early next year.\n\nThe plan is then to get certified by regulators in time to begin service on the French Riviera in 2026, ferrying wealthy visitors who currently arrive by helicopter from Monaco on to Nice, Cannes and Saint-Tropez.\n\nThe helicopters are hated by local residents for their noise. \"All the mayors come and say, 'We kiss your feet if you come with your aircraft,' \" Roewe said.\n\nBut without the government funding, Lilium might not survive. Roewe finds it unfair that Joby got $600 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to explore military uses.\n\nTrade magazine Aviation Week reported earlier this month that investor sentiment has dramatically cooled on air taxi projects as skepticism grows that they will ever make money.\n\nJoby's plan to start service in Dubai and Lilium's in the Riviera suggests the initial market will be limited to the wealthy.\n\nBevirt would consider that a failure. He believes that if Joby scales up as he hopes it will, costs will fall.\n\n\"In 10 years' time, is this something that's going to be broadly accessible and broadly affordable?\" he said. \"That is the crux of what we are trying to accomplish and the crux of why I founded this company.\"\n\nCount Airbus' Scherer a skeptic.\n\n\"I think a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_gates@seattletimes.com", "name": "Dominic Gates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air taxi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puget Sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough,_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough, Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Farnborough, Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joby_Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joby Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propeller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edwards Air Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lilium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farnborough Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

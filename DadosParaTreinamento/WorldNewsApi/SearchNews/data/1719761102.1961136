These tasks include monitoring the tire pressure, changing the oil, getting a tune-up, rotating the tires and more. However, many people are not aware that regular washing should be on that maintenance list as well. Washing your car as often as experts recommend \u2014 at least twice each month \u2014 can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To help ensure you don\u2019t become lax in your duties, it helps to have the best supplies available to make the task as easy as possible. Why it is important to wash your car regularly If you don\u2019t regularly bathe or shower, sweat, dirt and more can accumulate on your skin. This can create an unhealthy environment that may trigger acne and cause dermatitis or even change the color of your skin due to a buildup of dead skin cells. You may even require medical attention to treat the problems that arise. While your car is not alive, it can suffer the same fate. Paint serves many of the same functions as your skin. It protects your vehicle. Regularly washing removes buildup that can damage the paint, allowing moisture to create rust on any underlying metal parts. Washing your car regularly also helps keep it looking new and increases its value. Even more important, dirt on the windshield can obscure visibility and create a safety hazard. function dfm_stn_player_script_id_g7yNjOE5( getS2NApiForPlayer ) { if( typeof window.MNGAuthentication !== \u2018undefined\u2019 ){ const s2nApi = getS2NApiForPlayer( document.querySelector(\u2018.k-g7yNjOE5\u2019) ); s2nApi.float = ! window.MNGAuthentication.isUserSubscriber(); } } Doesn\u2019t rain wash my car for me? It would seem that a good torrential downpour would do wonders for your car. In truth, there are some benefits to letting nature wash your car. However, the downsides make this an unreliable and potentially damaging approach. The pros of letting the rain wash your car Rain is free. It falls from the sky, and you do not have to pay for it. Even better, the rain does all the work for you as it falls. You do not have to apply any elbow grease. If it is a downpour, the rain may even remove unpleasantries, such as bird droppings, so you don\u2019t have to get your hands dirty. To some extent, rain does help keep your car clean. The cons of letting the rain wash your car The bad part about the weather is it is not something you can control. If your car is dirty, you can\u2019t make it rain on demand. Even worse, rainwater is not very clean. Anything it picks up in the atmosphere can remain on your vehicle after the rain has ended, creating water spots and other imperfections. This means precipitation that picks up sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from burning fossil fuels can form sulfuric or nitric acids, which can damage your car\u2019s paint. Even after the rain dries, the acid can remain and be catalyzed to cause more damage every time it gets wet. As counterintuitive as it sounds, sometimes the best time to wash your car is after it rains. Car washing tips Start from the top. Water and dirt flow down. If you don\u2019t start at the top, you create twice as much work for yourself because you will have to clean the bottom again. Use the right soap. If you use anything other than soap formulated for your car\u2019s finish, you could damage your paint. Rinse the car first. Any grime that isn\u2019t rinsed off will become abrasive and scratch your paint when you start cleaning. Use two buckets. One bucket should be designated for rinsing, and the other should have soap for cleaning. Never rinse your dirty sponge in the cleaning bucket. Use a microfiber towel for drying. Other fabrics are too abrasive. A microfiber towel gives you the best chance to dry without damaging the paint. Products you need to wash your car One of the biggest frustrations with washing your car isn\u2019t the task. It\u2019s making sure you have everything on hand that you need. With the Chemical Guys comprehensive car wash kit, you get everything you need from the bucket and mitt to soap and after wash. This car care kit from Armor All goes beyond mere washing. You get everything you need to keep your vehicle in pristine condition, from the wheels and windshield to the interior. And, as a bonus, you also get a microfiber wash pad. Another waterless wash and wax alternative is Aero Cosmetics\u2019 car wash and wax kit. The large 144-ounce container is enough to wash up to 28 cars and can be used on interior surfaces. It is made with a biodegradable, plant-based eco-friendly formula and comes with microfiber towels and a mini bug scrubber. This versatile car cleaning tool has an anti-slip, rugged, aluminum alloy handle that extends up to 62 inches. The scratch-free microfiber brush head can be removed for washing, drying, waxing, dusting or polishing for up-close, detail cleaning without the pole. With this clever storage accessory, you can keep everything neatly organized, so when it\u2019s time to clean your car, you just grab the handle of your bucket and have everything you need. It is important to note that the bucket is not included, but the organizer is designed to fit most five-gallon buckets. Dragging out the hose can be a hassle. Walking it around your car can also be frustrating because it keeps getting caught under the wheels. The Sun Joe portable spray washer kit is a portable battery-powered washer that you can use for quick rinsing tasks. The maximum pressure is 116 psi at 1.5 GPM. The best defense is not exposing your car to elements in the first place.

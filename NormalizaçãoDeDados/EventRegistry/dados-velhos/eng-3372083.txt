This is even more worrisome for us.\"\n\nAbout 1.9 hectares (4.7 acres) of the hillside collapsed in Monday's landslide, which covered homes in an area spanning 3.6 hectares (8.9 acres), the minister said.\n\nMore rain is expected to fall in the country over the next few days, which increases the threat of a new landslide, the minister said.\n\n\"We are really very worried; the weather conditions are still not favorable. The prediction is that we are expecting more rain in the next couple of days... We want to be able to evacuate as much people as we can before we find ourselves in this situation again.\"\n\nThe country is already overwhelmed as it tries to respond to the fallout from Monday's landslide, Tunis said.\n\n\"We are now busy evacuating people. We have mounted tents and shelters. ... It is a race against time and the resources that are available,\" he said. \"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist.\"\n\nMass burial\n\nMourners were gathering to pay respects at a mass burial Thursday afternoon as the search continues for other victims.\n\nThe mass burial, initially planned for Wednesday, was postponed for a day to allow families to identify their loved ones. The country's President, Ernest Bai Koroma, and other dignitaries including Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf were expected to attend the ceremony.\n\nThe death toll has climbed to 331, Tunis said, with rescue workers recovering the bodies of 122 children, 111 men and 98 women from the wreckage so far.\n\nAround 600 people are still unaccounted for after heavy rains struck the Regent district in the early hours of Monday, according to government officials and aid agencies.\n\nHouses that hugged the slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nMany residents appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family members, including her heavily pregnant sister.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMorgue overwhelmed\n\nThe city morgue at the Connaught Hospital has been overwhelmed by the influx of victims in what is one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people have also been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nNonetheless, rights group Amnesty International said the authorities could have done more to avert the crisis.\n\n\"While flooding is a natural disaster, the scale of the human tragedy in Freetown is, sadly, very much man-made,\" said Makmid Kamara, the organization's deputy director of global Issues.\n\n\"The authorities should have learned lessons from previous similar incidents and put in place systems to prevent, or at least minimize, the consequences of these disasters. Devastating floods are now an annual occurrence in the country's capital. Yet, due to a lack of regulation and insufficient consideration for minimum standards and environmental laws, millions of Sierra Leoneans are living in dangerously vulnerable homes.\"\n\nInternational aid is now needed to provide temporary accommodation, proper sanitation and health care to those affected, Amnesty said, as it warned that the death toll was likely to rise \"substantially.\"\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II sent her condolences Thursday to the people of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have lost loved ones and those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected,\" she said in a statement posted on her official Twitter account.\n\nRelated Items Sierra Leone, mudslide, africa", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:06:00Z",

This is even more worrisome for us.\"\n\nAbout 1.9 hectares (4.7 acres) of the hillside collapsed in Monday's landslide, which covered homes in an area spanning 3.6 hectares (8.9 acres), the minister said.\n\nMore rain is expected to fall in the country over the next few days, which increases the threat of a new landslide, the minister said.\n\n\"We are really very worried; the weather conditions are still not favorable. The prediction is that we are expecting more rain in the next couple of days... We want to be able to evacuate as much people as we can before we find ourselves in this situation again.\"\n\nThe country is already overwhelmed as it tries to respond to the fallout from Monday's landslide, Tunis said.\n\n\"We are now busy evacuating people. We have mounted tents and shelters. ... It is a race against time and the resources that are available,\" he said. \"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist.\"\n\nMourners were gathering to pay respects at a mass burial Thursday afternoon as the search continues for other victims.\n\nThe mass burial, initially planned for Wednesday, was postponed for a day to allow families to identify their loved ones. The country's President, Ernest Bai Koroma, and other dignitaries including Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf were expected to attend the ceremony.\n\nThe death toll has climbed to 331, Tunis said, with rescue workers recovering the bodies of 122 children, 111 men and 98 women from the wreckage so far.\n\nAround 600 people are still unaccounted for after heavy rains struck the Regent district in the early hours of Monday, according to government officials and aid agencies.\n\nHouses that hugged the slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nMany residents appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family members, including her heavily pregnant sister.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nThe city morgue at the Connaught Hospital has been overwhelmed by the influx of victims in what is one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people have also been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nNonetheless, rights group Amnesty International said the authorities could have done more to avert the crisis.\n\n\"While flooding is a natural disaster, the scale of the human tragedy in Freetown is, sadly, very much man-made,\" said Makmid Kamara, the organization's deputy director of global Issues.\n\n\"The authorities should have learned lessons from previous similar incidents and put in place systems to prevent, or at least minimize, the consequences of these disasters. Devastating floods are now an annual occurrence in the country's capital. Yet, due to a lack of regulation and insufficient consideration for minimum standards and environmental laws, millions of Sierra Leoneans are living in dangerously vulnerable homes.\"\n\nInternational aid is now needed to provide temporary accommodation, proper sanitation and health care to those affected, Amnesty said, as it warned that the death toll was likely to rise \"substantially.\"\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II sent her condolences Thursday to the people of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have lost loved ones and those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected,\" she said in a statement posted on her official Twitter account.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T20:02:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3839, "date":

We have mounted tents and shelters... It is a race against time and the resources that are available,\" he said. \"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist.\"\n\nMass burial\n\nMourners are preparing to lay their dead to rest in a mass burial Thursday afternoon, as the search continues for other victims.\n\nThe mass burial, initially planned for Wednesday, was postponed for a day to allow families to identify their loved ones. The country's President, Ernest Bai Koroma, and other dignitaries are expected to attend the afternoon ceremony.\n\nThe death toll has climbed to 331, Tunis said, with rescue workers recovering the bodies of 122 children, 111 men and 98 women from the wreckage so far.\n\nAround 600 people are still unaccounted for after heavy rains struck the Regent district in the early hours of Monday, according to government officials and aid agencies.\n\nHouses that hugged the slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nMany residents appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family members, including her heavily pregnant sister.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMorgue overwhelmed\n\nThe city morgue at the Connaught Hospital has been overwhelmed by the influx of victims in what is one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people have also been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nNonetheless, rights group Amnesty International said the authorities could have done more to avert the crisis.\n\n\"While flooding is a natural disaster, the scale of the human tragedy in Freetown is, sadly, very much man-made,\" said Makmid Kamara, the organization's deputy director of global Issues.\n\n\"The authorities should have learned lessons from previous similar incidents and put in place systems to prevent, or at least minimize, the consequences of these disasters. Devastating floods are now an annual occurrence in the country's capital. Yet, due to a lack of regulation and insufficient consideration for minimum standards and environmental laws, millions of Sierra Leoneans are living in dangerously vulnerable homes.\"\n\nInternational aid is now needed to provide temporary accommodation, proper sanitation and health care to those affected, Amnesty said, as it warned that the death toll was likely to rise \"substantially.\"\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II sent her condolences Thursday to the people of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have lost loved ones and those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected,\" she said in a statement posted on her official Twitter account.\n\nCNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Caroline Paterson and Hilary McGann contributed to this report.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:25:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3835, "date": "2017-07-01", "amb": false, "textStart": 3815, "dateEnd": "2017-08-13", "imp": true}], "sim": 0.9647058844566345, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3372083", "time": "16:25:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372083", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "204", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "73707", "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portuguese Republic"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "77013", "label": {"eng": "Freetown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Freetown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "77894", "label": {"eng": "Tunis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisian Republic"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 2}, {"id": "303240", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "score": 4}, {"id": "303241", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "score": 5}, {"id": "303248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Flood"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "score": 2}, {"id": "303498", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "score": 2}, {"id": "303539", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "304269", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "score": 5}, {"id": "305976", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "score": 2}, {"id": "306777", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mudslide"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudslide", "score": 4}, {"id": "306866", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "score": 2}, {"id": "306936", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wet season"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season", "score": 2}, {"id": "318622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Debris"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris", "score": 2}, {"id": "318692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Aid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "score": 1}, {"id": "331248", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "score": 2}, {"id": "337447", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mass grave"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_grave", "score": 4}, {"id": "415349", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Government of Punjab, India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Punjab,_India", "score": 3}, {"id": "477498", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ernest Bai Koroma"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bai_Koroma", "score": 3}, {"id": "950335", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Connaught Hospital"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connaught_Hospital", "score": 2}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/muscatinejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/26/c2641e12-0ab7-5868-a781-a2640d91a2f1/5995943a75b64.preview.jpg?crop=779%2C438%2C0%2C0&resize=779%2C438&order=crop%2Cresize", "timeCrawl": "16:25:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Sierra Leone: New mudslide threat looms ahead of mass burial", "originalArticle": null}

More than 150 children were among the dead, he said.\n\nThe death toll includes those killed in mudslides on the outskirts of the West African nation's capital, Freetown, and fatalities from flash floods in other provinces, Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman told CNN earlier.\n\nAbout 20,000 people have been displaced by the mudslides, including 5,000 children, presidential spokesman Abdulai Bayraytay said.\n\nThe country also must battle cholera and malaria, Rahman said, in the wake of one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nSome residents have gotten skin infections from the water they have been washing in, and officials are putting in place plans for cholera preparedness and prevention, she said. \"We are equipped to a point. We can't do it alone,\" she added.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, said Tunis, the tourism and cultural affairs minister.\n\nRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\n\n\"The number of people dead is changing every day,\" she said. \"We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried.\"\n\nElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity.\"\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMore rain expected\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nBritain steps in with $6.4 million in aid\n\nThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMass burial\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\n'Another grim episode in our nation's history'\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community.

We can't do it alone,\" she added.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Minister Sidie Yahya Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, Tunis said.\n\nRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\n\n\"The number of people dead is changing every day,\" she said. \"We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried.\"\n\nElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity.\"\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes.

We have so far buried 450 corpses,\" he told AFP. \"Most of the bodies were found decomposed and families were not allowed to identify (them).\"\n\nHe added: \"We're receiving calls from disaster-hit communities every three to four hours about a corpse found in a drainage or under a collapsed building.\"\n\nThree more bodies were found in a search for survivors in the Regent district, where the side of a hill collapsed, the emergency services said.\n\nThe disaster struck on Monday after Freetown, home to 1.2 million people and the capital of one of the world's poorest countries, had been pounded for three days by torrential rain.\n\nAccording to the charity Save the Children, the disaster killed 122 children and left 123 orphaned.\n\nThe Red Cross has issued an emergency funding appeal. Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, has pledged \u00a35 million, while China has pledged $1 million (USD) and Togo $500,000 (USD).\n\nWater-borne diseases such as cholera and malaria are a major fear.\n\n\"This is a potential health hazard. That's why we need to continue the operations to ensure that we remove as much dead bodies as possible,\" said Colonel Abu Bakarr Sidique Bah of the Sierra Leone armed forces.\n\nBut the search for victims has been arduous, especially in the Regent neighbourhood.\n\n\"It is actually thousands of tonnes of rubble that have fallen...

On Thursday, 413 people laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, he said.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of victims in one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with 600 people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people also have been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN earlier this week.\n\nThe displaced are sleeping outside \"because there are not enough shelters for everybody,\" Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nHe said that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity\" and appealed to the international community to ramp up its support.\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nUK first aid\n\nThe United Kingdom is pledging an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\n'Another grim episode in our nation's history'\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes. Sierra Leone will rise again.\"\n\nPrivate donations\n\nPrivate citizens have been turning up at the disaster site with food donations, clothing and other items to help the displaced. Others are donating money, and a group of around 100 young people held a candle-lit vigil Thursday to mourn friends who had died.\n\nOrganized by a local nongovernmental organization called the Family, some carried a banner of one of their friends, a woman who was just 26. Some marchers wept openly.\n\nAs they gathered under the famous Freetown Cotton Tree, they said a Christian prayer, and an organizer called for a member of the crowd to offer up a Muslim one, too, in a symbol of religious unity and tolerance.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

We can't do it alone,\" she added.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Minister Sidie Yahya Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, Tunis said.\n\nRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\n\n\"The number of people dead is changing every day,\" she said. \"We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried.\"\n\nElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity.\"\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes. Sierra Leone will rise again.\"\n\nPrivate citizens have been turning up at the disaster site with food donations, clothing and other items to help the displaced. Others are donating money, and a group of around 100 young people held a candle-lit vigil Thursday to mourn friends who had died.\n\nOrganized by a local nongovernmental organization called the Family, some carried a banner of one of their friends, a woman who was just 26. Some marchers wept openly.\n\nAs they gathered under the famous Freetown Cotton Tree, they said a Christian prayer, and an organizer called for a member of the crowd to offer up a Muslim one, too, in a symbol of religious unity and tolerance.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Credit: SEYLLOU/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSierra Leone is facing significant health challenges after this week's devastating mudslides claimed at least 467 lives, a government health official said Friday, with the number of dead expected to rise.\n\nThe death toll includes those killed in mudslides on the outskirts of the West African nation's capital, Freetown, and fatalities from flash floods in other provinces, Deputy Health Minister Madina Rahman told CNN.\n\nThe country also must battle cholera and malaria, Rahman said, in the wake of one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nSome residents have gotten skin infections from the water they have been washing in, and officials are putting in place plans for cholera preparedness and prevention, she said. \"We are equipped to a point. We can't do it alone,\" she added.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Minister Sidie Yahya Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, Tunis said.\n\nRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\n\n\"The number of people dead is changing every day,\" she said. \"We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried.\"\n\nElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity.\"\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people also have been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN earlier this week.\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes. Sierra Leone will rise again.\"\n\nPrivate citizens have been turning up at the disaster site with food donations, clothing and other items to help the displaced. Others are donating money, and a group of around 100 young people held a candle-lit vigil Thursday to mourn friends who had died.\n\nOrganized by a local nongovernmental organization called the Family, some carried a banner of one of their friends, a woman who was just 26. Some marchers wept openly.\n\nAs they gathered under the famous Freetown Cotton Tree, they said a Christian prayer, and an organizer called for a member of the crowd to offer up a Muslim one, too, in a symbol of religious unity and tolerance.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.", "dateTime":

We can't do it alone,\" she added.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of bodies.\n\nOn Thursday, 413 people were laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Minister Sidie Yahya Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, Tunis said.\n\nRahman, the health official, appealed for international support, saying the country can't do it alone.\n\n\"The number of people dead is changing every day,\" she said. \"We have just done a census recently, and we are working with the statistics office to see how many people are on that site and how many people are unaccounted for and how many people were dead and buried.\"\n\nElhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, also told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that other countries must step up, saying that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity.\"\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMore rain expected\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people also have been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN earlier this week.\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally. The gravity is huge, and the magnitude is just so much for this nation to handle. I pray that other countries will come in to assist,\" he said.\n\nBritain steps in with $6.4 million in aid\n\nThe United Kingdom is offering an initial $6.4 million in emergency support to provide clean drinking water food and medicines, UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced. The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMass burial\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\n'Another grim episode in our nation's history'\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes. Sierra Leone will rise again.\"\n\nPrivate donations\n\nPrivate citizens have been turning up at the disaster site with food donations, clothing and other items to help the displaced. Others are donating money, and a group of around 100 young people held a candle-lit vigil Thursday to mourn friends who had died.\n\nOrganized by a local nongovernmental organization called the Family, some carried a banner of one of their friends, a woman who was just 26. Some marchers wept openly.\n\nAs they gathered under the famous Freetown Cotton Tree, they said a Christian prayer, and an organizer called for a member of the crowd to offer up a Muslim one, too, in a symbol of religious unity and tolerance.\n\nFlooding is not unusual in the region, which is experiencing its rainy season.\n\nBut this year has been particularly wet, with Freetown receiving more than 27 inches of rain between July 1 and August 13 -- more than double the average of 11.8 inches, according to the US National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.", "dateTime":

On Thursday, 413 people laid to rest in a mass burial in the nearby town of Waterloo, Tunis said. About a third of the deaths were children, he said.\n\nThe city morgue at Connaught Hospital in Freetown has been overwhelmed by the influx of victims in one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit Africa in recent years.\n\nThe crisis began Monday when heavy rains caused mudslides from the denuded slopes of Mount Sugar Loaf, about 5 miles from Freetown. Houses that hugged the slopes, many of them little more than wooden shacks with tin roofs, were buried after torrents of mud poured down under the force of the water.\n\nRescue workers told CNN they were losing hope of finding whole bodies in the debris, with 600 people still unaccounted for. Some body parts have washed up on nearby beaches.\n\nMany appeared shell-shocked in the wake of the disaster, crying as they walked along or looked for missing loved ones. One woman told CNN she had lost most of her family, including a sister who was heavily pregnant.\n\nAnother resident, Ishmael Tomboyeke, said he was also looking for his sister's body. After seeing the mudslide, he said, \"I ran there, I saw where the house was, everything was demolished.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities are preparing to evacuate other hillside areas amid concern more landslides could take place.\n\n\"Evacuation is being discussed. Some have been happening but not on a large scale,\" Tunis said. \"We have to plan, and we are working at looking at the numbers involved.\"\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people also have been displaced, Abu Bakarr, spokesman for the Red Cross in Sierra Leone, told CNN earlier this week.\n\nThe displaced are sleeping outside \"because there are not enough shelters for everybody,\" Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nHe said that Sierra Leone was facing a crisis \"way beyond (its) capacity\" and appealed to the international community to ramp up its support.\n\nMore rain is expected over the next few days, increasing the threat of a new landslide, Tunis said Thursday.\n\n\"At this point, more hands are needed on deck, both locally and internationally.

The money will go to UNICEF, the UN children's agency that's also responsible for water and nongovernmental organizations.\n\n\"This tragedy comes shortly after the Ebola crisis, which Sierra Leone has worked so hard to recover from,\" Patel said. \"Britain was at the forefront in tackling that deadly disease, and we remain shoulder to shoulder with Sierra Leone today after these devastating events.\"\n\nIn 2000, the UK, a former colonial power of Sierra Leone, sent troops to end the bitter civil war there. More recently Sierra Leone was one of the country's worst hit from the Ebola crisis, with nearly 4,000 dying from the disease.\n\n\"Our new support will provide basic life-saving supplies like food, water, shelter and clothing to people who have lost everything,\" Patel said. \"The international community must follow our lead and step up to the plate.\"\n\nMass burial\n\nMourners gathered Thursday to pay respects at a mass burial attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nA team of around 100 men gathered to dig graves under the burning sun.\n\n\"I'm happy to do this for my fellow countrymen. It's a sad time, but we have to pull together,\" Momodu Bah told CNN.\n\nHundreds started to line the perimeters of the cemetery in Waterloo in the afternoon, eager to pay their last respects. Some climbed trees to get a better look.\n\nMuslim and Christian prayers were offered during the short interfaith ceremony. The imam's voice trembled as he read prayers for the dead, and Koroma laid a wreath to commemorate the deaths.\n\n'Another grim episode in our nation's history'\n\nIn an address, Koroma said: \"We have come here to pay our last respects to our loved ones ... our friends ... and to our community. We've come to comfort the bereaved and reassure them that they are not alone.\n\n\"This is another grim episode in our nation's history. They had their hopes and aspirations for a bright future.\"\n\nHe said a group of students studying together were among the victims in an house that was crushed.\n\nThe President also spoke of a man who had saved for years to move his family into the area affected by the mudslide and another who was due to marry Friday.\n\n\"These heartbreaking stories are so painful,\" he said. \"We have buried them, but we will not bury our hopes.

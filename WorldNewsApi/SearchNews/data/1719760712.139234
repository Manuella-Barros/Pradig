Edinburgh is gearing up to welcome the US superstar for the first time as well as the 210,000 Swifties who will descend on the capital next month. The global superstar will perform at Murrayfield Stadium on June 7, 8 and 9. The pop icon is set to bring entertainment and economic value, coined the \u2018Swift lift\u2019, with shows across the UK expected to gross a combined \u00a31 billion according to Barclays.

That impact is already being seen in Edinburgh, with hotels reporting increased demand. Forever Edinburgh, the city\u2019s destination marketing and promotions brand, which is run by The City of Edinburgh Council, is looking to capitalise on this by announcing a series of experiences for those living, visiting and working in the city. It has announced a programme of activity to help visitors, residents and businesses enjoy the benefits of the concert. Launching on Thursday, June 6, more than 50 local hospitality and tourism businesses have come together to create the Edinburgh Taylored Taste Trail. Across the city, fans can enjoy Taylor themed sweet treats from Babyfaced Baker, Cuckoo\u2019s Bakery and the Little Bakery.

Theunique Taylored experience will showcase the best of Edinburgh\u2019s retail, hospitality, and food & drink scenes, encouraging fans and their friends to explore the city's diverse neighbourhoods by foot, tram, bus, or other modes of transport. Featured prominently on Forever Edinburgh\u2019s dedicated Swift Fan Hub, the Taylored Taste Trail will be accompanied with a Taste Trail map, a list of top tips to help fans plan ahead and make responsible choices, plus a guide to Edinburgh for Swifties. City leaders have also organised a welcome gift for Swift, collaborating with a selection of Edinburgh businesses to build a hamper full of Scottish goodies. Participants include Eateaket, Edinburgh Gin and kiltmakers Kinloch Anderson, who have made three unique gifts for Taylor from a newly created Edinburgh 900 Tartan. A personalised itinerary is also enclosed with the must-dos for Swift to visit during her stay, which was personally crafted and gifted to the star as part of the wider city gesture. This is based on her favourite things such as a visit to cat caf\u00e9 Maison de Moggy and experiencing Edinburgh\u2019s music scene. Culture and Communities Convener, Councillor Val Walker said: \u201cWe\u2019re enchanted to be welcoming Taylor to the city and to be able to bring all these businesses together to provide a fun weekend for residents and visitors alike. We aim to ignite curiosity among fans to venture across the city, spreading foot traffic and benefits throughout. \u201cOur goal is to cultivate a positive fan experience, fostering lasting advocacy for Edinburgh among our visitors while ensuring a positive impact on residents.

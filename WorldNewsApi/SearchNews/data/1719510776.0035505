Tejashwi Yadav said that PM Modi came to Bihar and said baseless, factless and false things publicly on Saturday where he once again tried to \u201cconfuse everyone\u201d but was unsuccessfully in his attempt. \u201cSuch things are not expected from you. We expect a healthy discussion from you as you must take care of the dignity of the post you are holding. The usage of terms like Mujra and Mangalsutra does not suit the Prime Minister of this big-hearted country. To be honest, we are worried about you,\u201d said Tejashwi Yadav, in a letter addressed to PM Modi. On the caste census, the Bihar LoP said that PM Modi must remember that leaders of all political parties of Bihar met him in August 2021 and demanded the caste census. \u201cChief Minister Nitish Kumar was also in favour of caste census. The proposal for caste census was passed unanimously in the Bihar Legislative Assembly on my initiative. We all demanded a caste census but PM Modi rejected it,\u201d Tejashwi Yadav wrote. He said that as soon as the JD-U and RJD government came to power in Bihar, it conducted a caste-based survey at the state\u2019s own expense and then in light of that survey, increased the scope of the reservation to 75 per cent. \u201cWe kept you (PM Modi) requesting, again and again, to include it in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution but he always had an anti-backward and anti-Dalit mentality,\u201d Tejashwi Yadav wrote. He said that the Prime Minister did not consider Bihar\u2019s important requests, which had a Bahujan voice in its favour. \u201cWe had also appealed to the Union Home Minister Amit Shah during the Eastern Regional Council meeting held in Patna on December 10, 2023,\u201d he said. On reservation, Tejashwi Yadav wrote, that PM Modi has found a unique way to end Babasaheb\u2019s reservation which is available for government jobs under Section 15 and Section 16 of the Constitution. \u201cIf you end government jobs in railways, army and other departments then what will be the concept of reservation? Shockingly, this serious concern is not in your priorities. We have urged you (PM Modi) many times in Parliament to make arrangements for reservation in the private sector so that a wide Bahujan population, Dalit community and other deprived groups get their due constitutional rights,\u201d he said. On reservation of Gujarati Muslims, Tejashwi Yadav said that all Dalits, extremely backward and tribal people know that BJP and PM Modi are staunch ideological enemies of Babasaheb, Birsa Munda, Kanshiram, Ram Manohar Lohia and Mandal Commission. \u201cI am also attaching the list of Muslim castes under the OBC category in Gujarat. Perhaps you are not aware that 25 castes of the Muslim community also get reservations in Gujarat. You were the Chief Minister of Gujarat for more than 13 years. So, refrain from spreading confusion and politics of hatred in the people,\u201d he wrote. He said that instead of fighting a democratic battle, PM Modi is threatening to send a 34-year-old youth (Tejashwi Yadav) to jail. \u201cAre you not tearing the Constitution into pieces by making such threats? Elections will come and go but do not harm the Constitution and the country\u2019s social structure anymore,\u201d Tejashwi Yadav wrote. \u2013IANS ajk/dan", "summary": "<p>Patna, May 26 (IANS) Bihar Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his \u2018Mujra\u2019 remarks, saying the PM should use dignified language&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/tejashwi-yadav-slams-pm-modi-for-mujra-remarks/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Tejashwi Yadav slams PM Modi for \u2018Mujra\u2019 remarks</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/tejashwi-yadav-slams-pm-modi-for-mujra-remarks/\">Tejashwi Yadav slams PM Modi for \u2018Mujra\u2019 remarks</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/tejashwi-yadav-slams-pm-modi-for-mujra-remarks/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202405263167118.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:34:19", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.142}

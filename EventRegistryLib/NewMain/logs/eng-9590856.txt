The winner advances to the Women's College World Series, which begins May 30 at Devon Park in Oklahoma City.\n\nCoach Patty Gasso's Sooners beat the Seminoles in the national championship series last year and in 2021.\n\nFlorida State has its own championship history under coach Lonni Alameda, winning the national title in 2018 and playing in three of the last five championship series.\n\nTexas rolling\n\nTexas played like a No. 1 overall seed at its regional, plowing through the Austin Regional by beating Siena 5-0 and Northwestern 14-2 and 7-0.\n\nThe Longhorns will host future SEC rival Texas A&M in super regionals starting Friday. Reese Atwood, a top-three finalist for USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year, heads a unit that leads the nation with a .383 batting average.\n\nAtwood has set Texas single-season records with 22 home runs and 88 RBIs. She has a .433 batting average and a .488 on-base percentage.\n\nKilfoyl dominates\n\nOklahoma State's Lexi Kilfoyl showed why she is one of three finalists for the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award by blowing through the competition in regional play.\n\nThe Big 12 Pitcher of the Year ranks second in the nation with a 1.08 ERA. In the Stillwater Regional, she went 3-0 with 0.74 ERA in 19 innings, struck out 21 and walked none. She claimed wins against Northern Colorado, Kentucky and Michigan.\n\nKilfoyl is the first Oklahoma State player to be named a top-three finalist. The fifth-seeded Cowgirls will host Arizona in super regionals starting Friday.\n\nUCLA returns\n\nTraditional power UCLA was knocked out in regionals last year in a shocking exit that included a loss to Grand Canyon.\n\nNot this time.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Bruins beat Grand Canyon 9-0 on Friday, then 9-1 in the rematch on Sunday to advance to super regionals. Sharlize Palacios had three home runs against Grand Canyon in regional play.\n\nUCLA will host No. 11 seed Georgia in super regionals starting Thursday.\n\nUpset specials\n\nBaylor and Arizona are the only two unseeded teams to break through the opening weekend.\n\nBaylor won at No. 13 Louisiana to clinch its spot in super regionals. Arizona beat Villanova, defeated No. 12 Arkansas, then topped Villanova again to advance.\n\nBaylor had the most dramatic turn of events. The Bears went into the final day of regional play unbeaten and would have to lose twice to be eliminated against Louisiana on the road.\n\nLouisiana won the first game 13-0 to set up the winner-take-all second game. Baylor trailed early but scored two runs in the fifth to take the lead for good in a 4-3 win.\n\nBaylor will visit No. 4 seed Florida in super regionals starting Friday.\n\nArizona visits Oklahoma State in a meeting that could plant the seeds for a rivalry. The Wildcats join the Cowgirls in the Big 12 next year.\n\nCanady cruising\n\nStanford's NiJaree Canady could be the nation's top player as a sophomore.\n\nThe third finalist for USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year leads the nation with 292 strikeouts and a 0.52 ERA. She'll lead the eighth-seeded Cardinal when they host No. 9 LSU starting Friday.\n\nCanady was the National Fastpitch Coaches Association's Freshman of the Year last season. She threw a one-hitter against Washington that pushed the Cardinal into the World Series semifinals.\n\nSEC dominance\n\nNine of the 16 remaining teams will be in the Southeastern Conference next year.\n\nTexas and Oklahoma will join the conference next year.\n\nTexas will face current SEC member Texas A&M. Third-seeded Tennessee will face No. 14 Alabama in a matchup of traditional SEC powers.\n\nIn other matchups, No. 4 seed Florida hosts Baylor, No. 11 Georgia visits No. 6 UCLA, No. 7 Missouri hosts No. 10 Duke and No. 9 LSU visits No. 8 Stanford.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She has a .433 batting average and a .488 on-base percentage.\n\nKilfoyl dominates\n\nOklahoma State's Lexi Kilfoyl showed why she is one of three finalists for the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award by blowing through the competition in regional play.\n\nThe Big 12 Pitcher of the Year ranks second in the nation with a 1.08 ERA.

She has a .433 batting average and a .488 on-base percentage.\n\nKilfoyl dominates\n\nOklahoma State's Lexi Kilfoyl showed why she is one of three finalists for the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year award by blowing through the competition in regional play.\n\nThe Big 12 Pitcher of the Year ranks second in the nation with a 1.08 ERA. In the Stillwater Regional, she went 3-0 with 0.74 ERA in 19 innings, struck out 21 and walked none.

Baylor trailed early but scored two runs in the fifth to take the lead for good in a 4-3 win.\n\nBaylor will visit No. 4 seed Florida in super regionals starting Friday.\n\nArizona visits Oklahoma State in a meeting that could plant the seeds for a rivalry.

She threw a one-hitter against Washington that pushed the Cardinal into the World Series semifinals.\n\nSEC dominance\n\nNine of the 16 remaining teams will be in the Southeastern Conference next year.\n\nTexas and Oklahoma will join the conference next year.\n\nTexas will face current SEC member Texas A&M.

No. 10 Duke and No. 9 LSU visits No. 8 Stanford.\n\n0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [],

A few unseeded teams made regionals exciting by pushing the hosts to a seventh game. In the end, it was mostly chalk during the first weekend of the tournament.\n\nNone of the strong mid-majors advanced, including No. 16 seed Louisiana. Only two unseeded teams -- Arizona and Baylor -- advanced to super regionals and both came from power leagues. The pair will have steep climbs if they hope to make it to the Women's College World Series.\n\nAll games will be aired or streamed on ESPN platforms but channels have only been set for the first game in each region.\n\nSo what should fans look for when the super regional round kicks off on Thursday, May 23?\n\nMany of this year's super regionals feature teams that will be conference foes next season when the latest round of conference realignment goes into effect. This all-Texas affair is one of those. The SEC looks to get even more dangerous next season when the top-seeded Longhorns join the league.\n\nTexas was expected to advance from its home regional fairly easily, but Texas A&M had a tougher group of teams to overcome.\n\nThe Aggies didn't care. They swept their home regional 3-0, including two wins over Sun Belt Tournament champion Texas State. Texas State was not an easy opponent, so the sweep was impressive.\n\nThis is a big step up.\n\nTexas is first in the country in team batting average (.383) and total hits (576). Its 8.16 runs per game are second in Division I. It is third in slugging percentage (.634). Its 1.47 home runs per game come in eighth while its 84 total home runs are tied for eighth. It is tied with Texas A&M for ninth with 219 total walks, although Texas played one more game. In the circle, the Longhorns have the fourth-best team ERA (1.75).\n\nOne place the Aggies have a clear advantage is on defense. They are ranked 19th in DI with a .975 fielding percentage compared to Texas at 103rd with a .966 fielding percentage. TAMU also ranks in the top 25 in runs scored (14th at 6.29) and slugging percentage (24th at .505).\n\nTexas A&M is trying to get to the WCWS for the first time under second-year head coach Trisha Ford. It would be the Aggies' first appearance since 2017 while the Longhorns were national runners-up in 2022. UT's absence from Oklahoma City likely ends at one year.\n\nThere are very few offensive statistical categories that don't feature Oklahoma in the top five. The Sooners are first in Division I in walks, second in batting average and slugging percentage, and third in runs scored and home runs per game.\n\nThat offensive firepower lifted the Sooners to a 3-0 sweep of their home regional. They outscored their opponents 18-5 in those games.\n\nFlorida State seemed to find its groove during regionals, as well. The Seminoles also swept the field at home, outscoring their opponents 18-7. It was a nice rebound after losing the ACC tournament championship to Duke on May 11.\n\nFSU will be back on the road this time. That's just one thing that favors OU in this series.\n\nThe Seminoles can take solace in the fact that four of the Sooners' six losses have come on their home field this season. Two were in their final regular season series against Oklahoma State. It's difficult to see the FSU pitching staff, which has a collective ERA of 3.60, replicating the performance of OSU's Lexi Kilfoyl.\n\nTo say the Lady Vols were dominant in their regional is an understatement. Three straight shutouts helped them outscore their opponents 21-0. Now, they will welcome fellow SEC team Alabama.\n\nThe Crimson Tide struggled to score against the Lady Vols when the two teams met in Tuscaloosa during the conference regular season. Alabama managed one win, but it was in a 1-0 victory. That was the only run it scored in three games. UT outscored Bama 7-1.\n\nIt's how Alabama's season has gone. The Tide are not an offensive powerhouse. Their .257 batting average ranked 211th in the nation and 11th in the SEC this season. The low average is accompanied by a lack of power with a slugging percentage (.394) that ranks 149th in the country and 12th in the SEC. Do they make up for that by being patient and drawing walks? Their 159 total walks -- good for 92nd in the country and 12th in the SEC -- suggest otherwise. At 4.21 runs per game, they were 151st in DI and 11th in the league.\n\nAlabama does have a very effective pitching staff. It is third in the SEC with a 1.98 ERA. The problem is that Tennessee is first at 1.40 and has a much more effective offense. It's tough to see the Crimson Tide giving the Lady Vols problems, especially in Knoxville.\n\nBaylor is one of the two unseeded teams to advance to super regionals. The Bears went to Lafayette and dismissed Sun Belt regular season champion Louisiana. The Ragin' Cajuns were thrilled to get to host the opening weekend and they looked to have a good path to at least supers, but the Bears proved that playing in a strong Big 12 can have its payoffs.\n\nIt didn't come easy. The Lafayette Regional was one of only four that went to seven games. It came down to a three-game series between the hosts and the Bears. They exchanged blowouts in the first two then Baylor took the final game in a tight 4-3 decision.\n\nFlorida also had a tough mid-major out of the Sun Belt in its regional. The Gators made it look easy with a sweep of the regional, including two run-rule victories over South Alabama.\n\nThe Gators are peaking at the perfect time. They're on an 11-game winning streak, most of it against good competition in the SEC.\n\nTwo years ago, three unseeded teams made it all the way to the WCWS. One of them played in the championship series. It would be a shock if either unseeded teams advanced this year given the strength of their opponents.\n\nArizona was sent to an SEC team's field for regionals and swept the regional for the second straight appearance. The Wildcats have not lost to an SEC team in regionals or super regionals since 2016. That's 16 straight games, the last eight of which have been on the road. Their only postseason losses to SEC teams over that period were two defeats by Alabama in Oklahoma City.\n\nThe problem for the Wildcats is that their time in SEC land is over. They are headed to Stillwater to play a future Big 12 conference foe. That foe has lost 10 games this season but only one was at home.\n\nThe only aspect of the game where Arizona is superior is defense. The Wildcats are ranked third in the nation in fielding percentage at .980. Even there, the Cowgirls aren't bad. They rank 20th at .975.\n\nArizona is a very good offensive team, but Oklahoma State is slightly better. The Cowgirls are even further ahead in the circle, which is where the game is really won or lost.\n\nOSU ace Kilfoyl is one of three finalists for USA Softball Player of the Year. She is second in the nation with a 1.08 ERA. She is 11th in hits allowed per game at 4.20. Her six shutouts rank 22nd in DI. She ranks 28th with 4.55 strikeouts per walk.\n\nMore importantly, the rest of the staff is strong, too. Oklahoma State is 13th with a 1.99 staff ERA. Their 14 shutouts rank 18th.\n\nArizona's staff has not demonstrated that it can match that. Its 3.70 ERA ranks 150th in the country and eighth of the nine teams in the Pac-12. The entire staff has eight shutouts, just two more than Kilfoyl has by herself. The only pitcher who has a complete game shutout for the Wildcats is Aissa Silva. It is the only complete game thrown by an Arizona pitcher this season.\n\nArizona is playing its best softball of the season and has made it to the WCWS the last three times it appeared in the postseason. It would be a shock if that streak stretched to four.\n\nIf UCLA still had something to prove after getting swept out of its home regional last season, it proved it. The Bruins had a strong field in their regional this year but they didn't blink.\n\nUCLA had two run-rule victories and were just good enough to hold off an offensively talented Virginia Tech team.\n\nGeorgia ran into some problems in the Athens Regional. As expected, those problems were courtesy of Liberty. The Bulldogs won their first game but were knocked into the losers' bracket in the matchup between day one winners. They had to win three elimination games, including defeating Liberty twice on Sunday.\n\nUCLA has a superb offense, but its young pitchers can surrender a lot of runs. While eight of the 13 teams in the SEC are outside the top 50 in scoring, Georgia ranks 25th with 5.93 runs per game. That would rank third in the Pac-12 behind Arizona and UCLA.\n\nThe problem for most Pac-12 teams when facing the Bruins was having the pitching to counter their strong offense. At the end of the season, Arizona twice had the Bruins on the ropes with late leads of 7-0 and 4-0 only to lose those games because of the formidable UCLA offense.\n\nGeorgia has a decent pitching staff, statistically speaking. The Bulldogs have a staff ERA of 2.67, putting them in the top 40 of DI teams. However, both of their primary pitchers have an ERA of 2.50 or higher.\n\nThese should be close games, but the Bruins have shown themselves to be clutch this season. They never give up, and they have the proven ability to rip the hearts out of their opponents at the last moment. It would be a surprise if UCLA didn't return to the WCWS this season.\n\nDuke was another team that might have felt it had something to prove. The Blue Devils were third in RPI on Selection Sunday but they did not get a top eight seed and a super regional at home. They also had a strong field in their region. They didn't let any of that defeat them.\n\nIn Columbia, things got a bit more difficult for the home team. It wasn't a power conference team that pushed Missouri, though. It was Omaha.\n\nThe Mavericks sent Mizzou to the losers' bracket on day one, but they couldn't take advantage of it. In the end, the Tigers came back on Sunday and beat Omaha twice to advance. It took nine innings to get the 1-0 victory in Game 7.\n\nWill that awaken Missouri or does it show some weakness that Duke can exploit? Omaha pushed the Tigers to the limit by allowing them to score just seven runs on 16 hits over three games. Two of those games went nine innings.\n\nDuke is a well-rounded team. Statistically, it has a big advantage on the offensive side of play and a small but significant advantage in the circle.\n\nThe Blue Devils average 6.88 runs per game, ranking them sixth in the nation. The Tigers score 4.81 runs per game, which is 87th in DI. In the circle, Duke is third in the nation with a staff ERA of 1.50 compared to Missouri's 10th-ranked ERA of 1.96.\n\nDespite not getting that super regional in Durham, Duke may end up getting the perfect draw to advance to its first WCWS.\n\nStanford didn't put its best foot forward during regionals and it almost cost them. They were one of the home teams that was pushed to seven games before escaping with two wins on Sunday.\n\nThe Cardinal did what they have done for most of the season. They won close games. They had to sweat out all three wins and got blown out in a loss. Cal State Fullerton won Game 6 by the score of 8-1 before Stanford won Game 7 by the score of 4-2.\n\nIt wasn't the most comforting display for a Stanford fan, especially if they remember the Cardinal's loss to Utah in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals or their loss to Oregon in the final game of the regular season. The team seems to be trending down at a crucial time.\n\nLSU had a much easier time of things in regionals. The slate was not especially difficult. Southern Illinois proved to be the toughest opponent, and the Tigers handled the Salukis with little trouble.\n\nThe old adage is that pitching and defense win championships. Stanford has the superior pitching as long as NiJaree Canady is in the circle. As for the defense, the Cardinal committed one error in each of its games against the Titans. It almost cost them, giving CSF an unearned run in each contest.\n\nLSU may not be as strong in the circle as Stanford, but it's no slouch. The Tigers' staff ERA is 2.19, good for 19th in the country. Stanford is 8th with a 1.82 team ERA.\n\nNeither team is great on offense, but the Tigers are superior to the Cardinal. LSU's 5.00 runs per game rank 67th in DI. Stanford is 91st with 4.77 runs per game.\n\nIf the Cardinal do not play clean defensive games, the Tigers have more than enough talent on both sides of the ball to win this series.", "source":

Composers John Andrew Grush and Taylor Newton Stewart\u2014aka the Newton Brothers\u2014are getting their score for the season in vinyl from merch company Mutant. Spread across two discs with 40 songs overall, the soundtrack features nearly all of the music the duo created for the show. It\u2019ll also come in a gatefold jacket with art of the team by Phantom City Creative, whose previous artwork for movies and TV includes Fall of the House of Usher, Barbenheimer, and last year\u2019s Godzilla Minus One. The vinyl discs themselves are equally colorful, with the primary X-Men yellow complimented by blue and red, colors this show associates with Charles and Magneto. \u201cMeeting expectations is hard. Exceeding them is even harder,\u201d said Mutant co-founder Eric Garza. \u201cX-Men \u201897 makes it look effortless in nearly every way, including the music. Featuring an excellent and faithful update to Ron Wasserman\u2019s original classic X-Men: The Animated Series theme, the Newton Brothers...craft a soundscape that includes giant sweeping orchestral and synth-driven cues that could comfortably exist in any day of future past.\u201d The full track list for X-Men \u201897's score can be seen below, and the vinyl is expected to release on September 6 for $40.

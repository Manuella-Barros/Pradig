A previous episode abruptly came to a halt when stars walked out leaving the famous results table empty. Watching the episode, an angry fan called the behaviour of two contestants \"disgusting\". The programme is essentially the B&B version of Come Dine With Me, with each episode featuring a series of B&B owners who take turns staying at each other's establishments before delivering their verdict in a nail-biting meeting. They each reveal how much they'd be willing to fork out for a night's stay at the B&Bs, with the winner walking away with the coveted Four In A Bed plaque. While it may seem like light-hearted viewing, the show has sparked some serious drama over the years. One particular episode, aired in 2020, even had viewers accusing a couple of playing dirty to bag the plaque. Karen and Graham had been scoring high with the other competing pairs for their award-winning guest house, Tigh Na Leigh, earlier in the week, making them strong contenders for the win. While viewers recognised the quality of the pair's B&B, they were left fuming over what they saw as Graham and Karen's 'underhand' tactics. When asked if they would consider staying at any of their competitors' properties, Graham and Karen gave a resounding 'no' to all and then proceeded to underpay them, despite giving high scores. They even short-changed one property by over \u00a360, reports OK!. The proprietors of Mercia Marina Lodges, Pete and Sue, declined payment from Karen and Graham after coming in under on their last instalment, considering it a personal affront. The filming abruptly came to a halt, leaving the table deserted. Instead of the typical process, the Four In A Bed narrator ended up revealing the results. Despite this, it was Karen and Graham who emerged victorious due largely to the scores given by others and their interactions with fellow contestants. Viewers were quick to weigh in on the couple's conduct, and many were decidedly unhappy about how events unfolded. One disgruntled fan weighed in on X, writing: \"It's okay to manufacture the win on four in a bed but you should never forget that you are on tv and there to showcase your bandb, property and facilities. Not your vile personalities and total lack of consideration for the other peoples establishments. Tigh Na Leigh not one to visit.\" Another viewer echoed this sentiment, saying: \"Disgusting behaviour, Four in a Bed they should of been disqualified I am so cross. We know who the winners are and it ain't them.\" Yet another chimed in, noting: \"They can now add 'biggest pair of Four In A Bed cheats' to their awards cabinet.\" Meanwhile, an April episode of Four In A Bed saw contestants forced to sleep in their car after the hosts went 'missing'. Sisters Lesley and Sarah were supposed to host the final visit of the week, but due to illness, they couldn't attend to their guests throughout their stay. Instead, Sarah's husband welcomed them and showed them to their rooms. Initially, everything seemed fine with the rooms, but upon closer inspection, things started to deteriorate. Mat and Helen were dissatisfied with the cleanliness of their room, finding earwigs in the sink and noticing that the silicone on the flue repair was causing smoke in the yurt. They were moved to another room, but the problems persisted. As Helen pulled back the bed covers, she commented: \"It feels damp.\" Mat added: \"There's dirt, hairs, there's a stain. It's just very dirty.\" Unhappy with their room, they opted to sleep in their car instead of their pod. The following day, Mat reflected on their decision, saying: \"The sleep was pretty poor, wasn't it? We slept in the car, I think I got about 45 minutes all in all sleep-wise.\" The pair explained that due to the dampness in the room and the dirty mattress, they found it more comfortable to sleep in the car. When it came time to provide feedback, the guests didn't hold back on their views on hygiene, with Mat and Helen giving them a score of three. Upon receiving the negative feedback, Lesley and Sarah were visibly upset. Lesley expressed her disappointment, saying: \"Gutted, I'm trying really hard not to cry actually. There's obviously more people who don't like glamping.\" Despite dismissing the criticism about their bedding as nonsense, they conceded there was a problem with bugs. Lesley further explained: \"Yes, there probably were earwigs in the sink, it's glamping, it's outdoors, it's not bugged tight.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Channel 4's Four In A Bed viewers were left fuming during one episode, branding a couple the 'biggest cheats ever' after they won the competition with 'disgusting' behaviour", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/four-bed-chaos-stars-walk-32988625", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article32988628.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_screenshot-2024-06-07-at-104747.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:29:12", "author": "Danni King", "authors": ["Danni King"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.119}

In 2014, she had sent Bangladesh parliament\u2019s Speaker Shirin Shermin Chaudhury and in 2019, Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid had attended the ceremony. So, this is the first time Hasina is attending Modi's swearing-in ceremony.

She is expected to meet Prime Minister Modi on Sunday and Monday and leave for Dhaka Monday evening. Hasina is also likely to meet the Gandhi family, as sources said that schedule is being worked out. While she had not been able to meet the Gandhis during her last visit in September 2023 during the G20 summit, she had met Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, her daughter Priyanka Gandhi and former PM Manmohan Singh in the October 2019 visit. In Male, the Maldives President\u2019s office said that Muizzu has accepted the invitation to attend the swearing-in ceremony. \u201cMunu Mahawar, High Commissioner of the Republic of India to the Republic of Maldives, presented the letter of invitation to the President during a courtesy call at the President's Office.

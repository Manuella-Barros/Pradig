Italy 1-0 to reach Euro 2024 knockouts", "body": "Riccardo Calafiori\u2019s own goal 9 minutes after half-time was the difference between the 2 sides in the biggest match to date at the Germany tournament\n\nSpain qualified for the last 16 of Euro 2024 with a match to spare on Thursday after beating Italy 1-0 in a dominant display which ensured that La Roja would go through as Group B winners.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori\u2019s own goal nine minutes after half-time was the difference between the two sides at Gelsenkirchen in the biggest match to date at the tournament in Germany.\n\nBut the slender margin of victory did not reflect a statement performance from Spain who completely nullified Italy and should have had the game won by half-time, as they did in their opening round thumping of Croatia.\n\nNico Williams was the star for Spain as he ran Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo ragged and supplied the cross from which the unfortunate Calafiori poked the winning goal into his own net.\n\nLuis de la Fuente\u2019s team have a perfect six points at the top of the group and take on Albania on Monday knowing that they are already in the knockout rounds and playing like potential champions.\n\nFor Italy Thursday\u2019s deserved defeat was a reality check as vibrant Spain peppered the brilliant Gianliugi Donnarumma\u2019s goal throughout the match while the Azzurri failed to have a single attempt on target.\n\nIt was a performance reminiscent of the Euro 2012 final between the two teams when Spain crushed Italy 4-0 in the last international hurrah for tiki-taka football.\n\nHowever all is not lost for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s team, who are second on three points, as a draw with Croatia on Monday will be enough to guarantee qualification behind Spain.\n\nSpain could have been ahead twice in the first 10 minutes but squandered two great headed chances.\n\nLess than two minutes were on the clock when an unmarked Pedri nodded Williams\u2019 pinpoint cross straight at Donnarumma.\n\nAnd then Williams, who had a field day against Di Lorenzo, was the guilty party by somehow heading wide Alvaro Morata\u2019s superbly delivered, inswinging ball from the left flank.\n\nSpain were clearly on top as Italy struggled to get out of their half, Gianluca Scamacca toiling on his own up front with little support and wasting possession when it did come his way.\n\nDonnarumma had to be at his best twice within a matter of seconds when he first stuck out a foot to deny Morata and then pulled off a superb fingertip save which kept out Fabian Ruiz\u2019s powerful drive from distance.\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the pitch, Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was a virtual spectator as Italy\u2019s sole shot in the first half came just before the break when Federico Chiesa blazed a poor effort over from a difficult position.\n\nThe same pattern of Spanish possession and Italian defending continued after half-time and Pedri again wasted a great chance in the 51st minute, slamming wide after Marc Cucurella pulled back a perfect low cross.\n\nBut Spain got the breakthrough soon after and it came through more sensational play from Williams on the left, who made mincemeat of Di Lorenzo before fizzing across a ball which Calafiori could not help but divert into his own goal.\n\nLa Roja went close to doubling their lead with two

Unsurprisingly, Nico Williams did the damage. The early candidate for breakout superstar at these Euros, Williams dribbled to the end line and delivered a low cross for \u00c1lvaro Morata to skim a header that Donnarumma could only touch off the leg of Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nA cruel own goal, yes, but one-nil could have been 4-0 by the hour mark. Still, all night, it felt like Italian logic came to Gelsenkirchen in search of a Rope-a-Dope point.\n\nSpain versus Italy quickly descended into Wile E. Coyote's eternal pursuit of the Road Runner. Except, this one time, the Road Runner did not escape.\n\nIt was like watching a hunter against prey that refused to accept their seemingly inevitable fate. International football royalty against the aristocrats of the beautiful game, what turned this into a near classic was how the Italians embraced the Spanish rules of engagement.\n\nWilliams toyed with right back Giovanni Di Lorenzo while Pedri interchanged with Morata up top, as La Roja conjured three early chances that would yield goals if not for Donnarumma.\n\nItaly are the defending European champions because of the giant Paris-Saint Germain netminder. England remember his penalty shootout saves at Wembley in 2021. How can they ever forget?\n\nIt took 88 seconds for the unplayable Williams to pick out little Pedri who caught a textbook header that Donnarumma denied with a sensational tip over his crossbar.\n\nFluid and direct, Williams also missed the target with a central header.\n\nHow would these relatively callow Italians cope? The answer was out-balls. With Nicol\u00f2 Barella refusing to be overawed in midfield and Federico Dimarco tearing up left at every opportunity, Luciano Spalletti's tactics were unmistakable; soak up the magnificence of Rodri, 16 year old Lamine Yamal and Williams before sucker-punching Spain in transition.\n\nOr lose trying.\n\nHigh stakes, especially with Morata almost scoring off Yamal's freakish ability to create space and Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz walloping a shot that required more heroics from Donnarumma.\n\nThe half-time statistics belied the 0-0 scoreline: Spain had 60 per cent possession and had five shots (four on target to zero from the Azzurri). Both sides took nine lumps out of each other but only two yellow cards, one each, appeared due to Slovenian referee Slavko Vin\u010di\u0107 only punishing Donnarumma verbals and Rodri, who is suspended for Albania on Monday in Dusseldorf.\n\nCome the second half, Andrea Cambiaso and Bryan Cristante relieved Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a packed middle third. But the song remained the same.\n\nSpain looked capable of scoring at any moment. When Williams drew a flock of whites shirts, Marc Cucurella overlapped and cut back for Pedro but this first touch extravaganza could not break the big man.\n\nUnlike England against Serbia and Denmark, the Spanish attitude to scoring was to keep on keeping on.\n\nYamal was an inch shy of rattling the top corner of the net. The teenager is special, already as impactful as Williams, despite their five year age gap.\n\nSpeaking of miles on the clock, Spalletti has waited decades for this opportunity. Last year the 65 year old delivered the Scudetto to Naples, the first league title since Diego Maradona's heyday, so he hardly lacks the ability to evolve. Ruthlessly, he replaced Gianluca Scamacca and Federico Chiesa with Mateo Retegui and Mattia Zaccagni.\n\nNothing changed. The stadium reverberated to the sound of \"Nico, Nico, Nico\" when Williams once again skinned Di Lorenzo before pounding an effort off the crossbar.\n\nSpain were so dominant that coach Luis De La Fuente removed Yamal and Pedro with 20 minutes remaining while Williams and Morata followed after 78 minutes.\n\nAnd still, Italy's plan was working. Just one chance and the great escape would become a reality. That moment came on 73 minutes when Robin Le Normand fouled Lorenzo Pellegrini to give Italy's number 10 a chance to sicken an increasingly nervous Spanish crowd. His free-kick was high and wide.\n\n85th minute: an Italian corner from Giacomo Raspadori had 21 players in the Spanish half. 18 in the box. Bryan Cristante flicked the low delivery that was easily claimed by Unai Sim\u00f3n.\n\nSuddenly the champions were in control. Spain held it together.\n\nSpain: Sim\u00f3n; Carvajal, Le Normand, Laporte, Cucurella; Pedri (Baena, 71), Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal (Torres, 71), Morata (Oyarzabal, 75), Williams (P\u00e9rez, 78).\n\nItaly:

Photo: AFP\n\nSpain qualified for the last 16 of Euro 2024 with a match to spare on Thursday after beating Italy 1-0 in a dominant display which ensured that La Roja would go through as Group B winners.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's own goal nine minutes after half-time was the difference between the two sides at Gelsenkirchen in the biggest match to date at the tournament in Germany.\n\nBut the slender margin of victory didn't reflect a statement performance from Spain who completely nullified Italy and should have had the game won by half-time, as they did in their opening round thumping of Croatia.\n\nNico Williams was the star for Spain as he ran Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo ragged and supplied the cross from which the unfortunate Calafiori poked the winning goal into his own net.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's team have a perfect six points at the top of the group and take on Albania on Monday knowing that they are already in the knockout rounds and playing like potential champions.\n\nFor Italy Thursday's deserved defeat was a reality check as vibrant Spain peppered the brilliant Gianliugi Donnarumma's goal throughout the match while the Azzurri failed to have a single attempt on target.\n\nIt was a performance reminiscent of the Euro 2012 final between the two teams when Spain crushed Italy 4-0 in the last international hurrah for tiki-taka football.\n\nHowever all is not lost for Luciano Spalletti's team, who are second on three points, as a draw with Croatia on Monday will be enough to guarantee qualification behind Spain.\n\nWilliams shines for Spain\n\nSpain could have been ahead twice in the first 10 minutes but squandered two great headed chances.\n\nLess than two minutes were on the clock when an unmarked Pedri nodded Williams' pinpoint cross straight at Donnarumma.\n\nAnd then Williams, who had a field day against Di Lorenzo, was the guilty party by somehow heading wide Alvaro Morata's superbly delivered, inswinging ball from the left flank.\n\nSpain were clearly on top as Italy struggled to get out of their half, Gianluca Scamacca toiling on his own up front with little support and wasting possession when it did come his way.\n\nDonnarumma had to be at his best twice within a matter of seconds when he first stuck out a foot to deny Morata and then pulled off a superb fingertip save which kept out Fabian Ruiz's powerful drive from distance.\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the pitch Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was a virtual spectator as Italy's sole shot in the first half came just before the break when Federico Chiesa blazed a poor effort over from a difficult position.\n\nThe same pattern of Spanish possession and Italian defending continued after half-time and Pedri again wasted a great chance in the 51st minute, slamming wide after Marc Cucurella pulled back a perfect low cross.\n\nBut Spain got the breakthrough soon after and it came through more sensational play from Williams on the left, who made mincemeat of Di Lorenzo before fizzing across a ball which Calafiori couldn't help but divert into his own goal.\n\nLa Roja went close to doubling their lead with two distance strikes from Morata and teen sensation Lamine Yamal, before the superb Williams smashed an effort past Donnarumma which came crashing out off the crossbar in the 71st minute.\n\nItaly pushed forward in hope of an equaliser after Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui replaced the ineffective Chiesa and Scamacca.\n\nBut in the dying moments Donnarumma again made two superb saves to twice stop Ayoze Perez making the scoreline better reflect a one-sided contest.\n\nRelated Topics", "source": {"uri": "sport.timesofmalta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsDesk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The winner of this fixture will book their place directly in the round of 16 of the European Championship. Ahead of the Spain vs Italy clash, let us take a look at the predictions.\n\nAccording to the Opta supercomputer, Spain are made the favourites for this match with a 45.8% win probability, while Italy's chances stand at 27.5%, and the draw is at 26.8%. Despite Italy's resilience, Spain holds a slight upper hand going into this game. We at Insidesport.IN predict La Roja to win the game 2-1.\n\nSpain, currently at the top of the group, have been impressive this year. La Furia Roja eased past Croatia with a 3-0 scoreline in their previous game and will look to achieve a similar result this week. Spain have ushered in a new generation of players and will need to rely on their younger stars to shine at Euro 2024.\n\nLamine Yamal, who was exceptional against Croatia, will aim to make a similar impact this week. Yamal, who became the youngest player to feature for any team in European Championship history when he started against Croatia, had the most touches in the opposition box (6), created the joint-most chances (3), and provided an assist for Dani Carvajal's first international goal.\n\nItaly are currently in second place in Group B and have stepped up to the plate in recent months. The Azzurri edged Albania with a narrow 2-1 victory in their first game of their UEFA Euro 2024 campaign and will be confident ahead of this fixture. Italy's comeback success saw them win their opening encounter in four consecutive major tournaments (European Championships and World Cups) for the first time in their history. This victory sets a solid foundation for the Azzurri as they look to build on that performance against Spain.\n\nSimon; Carvajal, Le Normand, Nacho, Cucurella; Pedri, Rodri, Ruiz; Yamal, Morata,

Nico Williams shone with a remarkable display and player of the match performance. Fabian Ruiz stood out in midfield, while Pedri Marc Cucurella also had a solid game.\n\nSpain assured their passage through to the knock-out stages of Euro 2024 with a dominant display over Italy.\n\nLuis De La Fuente's men got off to a very fast start, with Italy unable to cope with the Spaniard's intensity. Both Pedri and Nico Williams came agonisingly close to opening the scoring with close-range headers. The latter of which reall should've ended up in the back of the net.\n\nThe 21-year-old did pull off the skill of the tournament though, producing a Cruyff turn on the half volley to get past Alessandro Bastoni. That was before Fabian Ruiz was denied from distance by a brilliant save from Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nThe second half started just as the first, with Pedri missing another guilt edge opportunity as he steered Marc Cucurella's cross wide from close range. Thankfully for the two-time European champions, Italy were on helping hand to help Spain take the lead, with Riccardo Calafiori bundling the ball into an empty net. It was almost two own goals shortly after, but Calafiori's header was cleared off the line by substitute Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nArsenal target Williams nearly capped off a brilliant night, but saw his curling effort smack against the crossbar. Ultimately, it mattered little as Spain were able to hang on to a comfortable three points.\n\nMatch Highlights Spain vs Italy Player Ratings GK: Unai Simon - 6/10\n\nDidn't have to make a save of any note. It was that kind of night for the goalkeeper.\n\nRB: Dani Carvajal - 6/10\n\nThe Real Madrid cult hero wasn't as dynamic as his counterpart on the other side of the pitch. However, he did provide some good support for young Yamal.\n\nCB: Robin Le Normand - 6/10\n\nIt was a quiet night for Le Normand at the back, but he was a nuisance from set pieces and looked confident when called into action.\n\nCB: Aymeric Laporte - 6/10\n\nAs with Robin Le Normand, not much to do for Laporte defensively as Italy offered little threat.\n\nLB: Marc Cucurella - 7/10\n\nThe Chelsea full-back proved once again why he was chosen in place of Bayer Leverkusen's Grimaldo. A picture perfect left-back display in many ways.\n\nCM: Fabian Ruiz - 7/10\n\nPSG's Fabian Ruiz has been their standout midfielder this tournament, and continued to be a threat from distance. Helped his country dominate the ball.\n\nCM: Rodri - 7/10\n\nA typical Rodri performance, calm and assured. However, his yellow card for talking to the referee will see him be suspended for the final group game.\n\nCM: Pedri:5/10\n\nA harsh rating perhaps, but Pedri's misses could've been costly. On multiple occasions the midfielder should've done better than he did, but did move the ball around well.\n\nRW: Nico Williams - 8/10\n\nOne of the performances of the tournament so far. Williams was electric from the start and was a real throwback to an old school winger. Absolutely superb.\n\nLW: Lamine Yamal - 7/10\n\nThe youngest ever player at the European Championships was outshone by Williams, but was also a constant threat on the opposite flank.\n\nST: Alvaro Morata - 6/10\n\nMorata led his team and the line well, but in crucial areas he took one too many touches which cost him. If not for that, he could've had a couple tonight.\n\nSub: Alex Baena - 5/10\n\nWasn't on long enough to make an impact as Spain were defending more in the final 15 minutes.\n\nSub: Ferran Torres - 5/10\n\nSame as Baena. Fresh legs and little impact further up the pitch.\n\nSub: Ayoze Perez - 6/10\n\nOne for Leicester and Newcastle fans. Perez made sure his short time on the pitch was memorable, producing a beautiful nutmeg and forcing Donnarumma into two smart saves.\n\nSub: Mikel Oyarzabal - 5/10\n\nThe forward had little to do after coming on.\n\nItaly GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - 7/10\n\nIf not for the Italian number one, this could've been a massacre. Donnarumma was in top form to keep Spain at bay with a number of fine saves.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - 3/10\n\nDi Lorenzo will be having nightmares about Nico Williams when he goes to sleep tonight. The winger ran circles around the Italian full back all evening.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - 5/10\n\nNot the Inter Milan star's best night as he too had to deal with the threat of Williams whenever he cut inside. Faired marginally better than Di Lorenzo.\n\nCB: Riccardo Calafiori - 4/10\n\nYou have to feel for Calafiori, who knew nothing about the own goal he scored. However, it was a costly error that in all likelihood has cost his country top spot.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - 4/10\n\nJust as torrid a night for Dimarco, who will be glad to see the back of Lamine Yamal.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - 5/10\n\nBarella was seen getting increasingly frustrated throughout, and looked the tidiest of Italy's midfielders. Not that it was difficult.\n\nCM: Jorginho - 4/10\n\nYou wouldn't have known that Jorginho was the player of the tournament at the last Euros. He looked completely out of his depth until being dragged off at half-time.\n\nCM: Davide Frattesi - 4/10\n\nAlmost exactly how Jorginho played. This is Frattesi's first international tournament so he gets a pass, but he has to do better in future.\n\nRW: Federico Chiesa - 5/10\n\nOn the break, you could see Chiesa carried threat. It was all too little though from the Juventus man.\n\nLW: Lorenzo Pellegrini - 5/10\n\nWas kept on when others came off, which is a sign that the Roma skipper was slightly more of a threat.\n\nST: Gianluca Scamacca - 4/10\n\nTo be fair to Scamacca, he had no service. Italy didn't play to his strengths and he could do little to turn the game around.\n\nSub: Bryan Cristante - 5/10\n\nThe most notable thing Cristante did was break the record for the fastest yellow card by a substitute in Euros history.\n\nSub: Andrea Cambiaso - 6/10\n\nCambiaso provided energy off the bench and also cleared an effort off the line. A solid cameo.\n\nSub: Mattia Zaccagni - 5/10\n\nProvided energy but no extra quality.\n\nSub: Mateo Retegui - 5/10\n\nUnable to make a major impact.\n\nSub - Giacomo Raspadori - 5/10\n\nUnable to make a major impact.\n\nPlayer of the Match Nico Williams\n\nNico Williams showed the world exactly what he was capable of with an incredible display on the left-hand side. From the first minute, the Athletic Bilbao star showed he was prepared to take the game by the scruff of the neck and turned Di Lorenzo inside and out on multiple ocassions.\n\nThe only thing missing from his incredible display was a goal. Something he came so close to getting when he saw a beautiful effort from the edge of the box smack the frame of the goal. He did flash the cross in for Spain's only goal of the game though, which is the very least he deserved.

The 42\n\nSPAIN QUALIFIED FOR the last 16 of Euro 2024 with a match to spare after beating Italy 1-0 in a dominant display which ensured that La Roja would go through as Group B winners.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's own goal nine minutes after half-time was the difference between the two sides at Gelsenkirchen.\n\nBut the slender margin of victory didn't reflect a statement performance from Spain who completely nullified Italy and should have had the game won by half-time, as they did in their opening round thumping of Croatia.\n\nNico Williams was the star for Spain as he ran Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo ragged and supplied the cross from which the unfortunate Calafiori poked the winning goal into his own net.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's team have a perfect six points at the top of the group and take on Albania on Monday knowing that they are already in the knockout rounds and playing like potential champions.\n\nFor Italy Thursday's deserved defeat was a reality check as vibrant Spain peppered the brilliant Gianliugi Donnarumma's goal throughout the match while the Azzurri failed to have a single attempt on target.\n\nIt was a performance reminiscent of the Euro 2012 final between the two teams when Spain crushed Italy 4-0 in the last international hurrah for tiki-taka football.\n\nHowever all is not lost for Luciano Spalletti's team, who are second on three points, as a draw with Croatia on Monday will be enough to guarantee qualification behind Spain.\n\nSpain could have been ahead twice in the first 10 minutes but squandered two great headed chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than two minutes were on the clock when an unmarked Pedri nodded Williams' pinpoint cross straight at Donnarumma.\n\nAnd then Williams, who had a field day against Di Lorenzo, was the guilty party by somehow heading wide Alvaro Morata's superbly delivered, inswinging ball from the left flank.\n\nSpain were clearly on top as Italy struggled to get out of their half, Gianluca Scamacca toiling on his own up front with little support and wasting possession when it did come his way.\n\nDonnarumma had to be at his best twice within a matter of seconds when he first stuck out a foot to deny Morata and then pulled off a superb fingertip save which kept out Fabian Ruiz's powerful drive from distance.\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the pitch Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was a virtual spectator as Italy's sole shot in the first half came just before the break when Federico Chiesa blazed a poor effort over from a difficult position.\n\nThe same pattern of Spanish possession and Italian defending continued after half-time and Pedri again wasted a great chance in the 51st minute, slamming wide after Marc Cucurella pulled back a perfect low cross.\n\nBut Spain got the breakthrough soon after and it came through more sensational play from Williams on the left, who made mincemeat of Di Lorenzo before fizzing across a ball which Calafiori couldn't help but divert into his own goal.\n\nLa Roja went close to doubling their lead with two distance strikes from Morata and teen sensation Lamine Yamal, before the superb Williams smashed an effort past Donnarumma which came crashing out off the crossbar in the 71st minute.\n\nItaly pushed forward in hope of an equaliser after Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui replaced the ineffective Chiesa and Scamacca.\n\nBut in the dying moments Donnarumma again made two superb saves to twice stop Ayoze Perez making the scoreline better reflect a one-sided contest.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024\n\nWritten by AFP and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won't find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women's sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

The team he coaches beat Italy by an own goal, scored by Riccardo Calafiori, to win the Group of Death with a match to spare but that doesn't tell the story, nor begin to express the way they took Italy apart. The surprise was not that Luciano Spalletti's side had lost here but that they did so narrowly, somehow alive to the last.\n\nSpain are in the next round; if they continue to play like this, they will surely go further too. Reaching the final, on this evidence, is no fantasy. The concern may be that a destruction so complete did not deliver a more comfortable victory, but what a performance this was, 20 shots fired off, 50 attacks launched, and illustrious opponents taken to pieces from the first minute to the last, when Ayoze P\u00e9rez came on and twice almost made it two. One would have to do, somehow.\n\nIn the buildup to this match Lamine Yamal had talked about the value of taking on the full-back, going one on one from the very start and refusing to let up; football, he said, is a \"psychological game\". If you beat him the first time, you can feel the fear, see it in his eyes. And if you don't, well, then you go back and do it again until you do. That was the theory, the idea the Spain coach drove into his two wingers; here it was in practice.\n\nThe game was only 85 seconds old when Nico Williams raced past Giovanni Di Lorenzo and delivered a glorious cross from which Pedri jumped and headed at goal. A few centimetres either side and it would surely have been the opener, but Gianluigi Donnarumma threw up a hand and pushed it over the bar. Williams had gone outside that time. He would come inside the next time, flying into the area, an opportunity to shoot momentarily opening up. The third time, he went back outside. Poor Di Lorenzo, he just couldn't live with this; it was a wonder his legs weren't tied in a cartoon knot.\n\nNot that Di Lorenzo was alone in his suffering; over on the other side Federico Dimarco was soon having almost as bad a time of it. The game wasn't even four minutes in when Lamine Yamal delivered the first dangerous ball, a warning that he was not going to let up either. Nico and Lamine, Lamine and Nico. Again and again. What a pair they are, two wingers who together are younger than Jes\u00fas Navas and who Italy could not live with. There was an ooh when Williams pirouetted, an aah when Lamine Yamal produced an outrageous touch to escape a wild lunge from Lorenzo Pellegrini. And there was attack after attack.\n\nNor was it just them. Marc Cucurella was superb. Rodri ran this, only he never seems to actually run. Pedri and Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz played. Spain took Italy to pieces, pressing high and also springing from deep. A lovely move began with \u00c1lvaro Morata nodding down and ended with him curling in a wonderful ball top the far post from where Williams nodded a clear opportunity wide.\n\nWilliams then skinned Di Lorenzo again before Lamine Yamal spun 30 yards from goal, left three men on the floor and scrambled the ball to Morata who turned away from Riccardo Calafiori and drew a sharp save from Donnarumma. Next a gorgeous, clean exchange between Pedri, Ruiz and Dani Carvajal worked an opening for Rodri on the edge of the area. Spain could have been three up and they weren't letting up. At half-time, it was almost absurd that they didn't lead. It was 9-1 in shots; Italy's had not come until stoppage time and in fairness it was a decent chance, sliced over by Federico Chiesa.\n\nStill Spain came; still, the chances went. Cucurella got beyond Italy and pulled back the perfect pass. From seven yards, Pedri sidefooted wide. He fell to the floor, head in the turf unable to believe it. Italy, though, could not hold out for ever. In fact, after 11 Spanish attempts, Italy scored the goal for them. Again, Williams did it, accelerating past Di Lorenzo. Morata could only get the slightest touch on the cross and the same was true of Donnarumma. Calafiori got more of one, deflecting into the net.\n\nSpain led but did not rest. This was relentless. Morata's shot was saved. Robin Le Normand's header was cleared off the line. And then Lamine Yamal curled just past the far post from 20 yards; what a goal that would have been. The 16-year-old turned to the stand and gestured for them to get on their feet.\n\nWhat a goal this would have been too: from the other side, Williams cut inside and hit a swinging shot that slammed back off the bar. That Spain's lead was still only one was ridiculous, and there had been a reminder that it wasn't over when Bryan Cristante sent a low cross all the way through the six-yard box where Mateo Retegui just failed to make contact. Spain though would not be denied.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sid_lowe@theguardian.com", "name": "Sid Lowe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Gonz\u00e1lez_(footballer,_born_2002)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer, born 2002)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Calafiori", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riccardo Calafiori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoze_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayoze P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Spalletti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luciano Spalletti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_Navas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas Navas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabi\u00e1n_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Le_Normand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin Le Normand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Binding_and_Finishing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Binding and Finishing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Floors", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Floors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf978dd046b14578ba37100104b09affe3f2c66/0_58_5727_3437/master/5727.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a9fa5daf3e3ab3fd273da774c520f414", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666783", "eventUri": "eng-9666783", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Albania's 1-0 lead was overturned within 16 minutes and the Azzurri subsequently showed enough poise and knowhow to see out the contest with little fuss.\n\nWhile their margin of victory was slender, optimism is beginning to emerge for Spalletti's side. Thursday's clash with Spain, who dazzled on Matchday 1, will be a big test of their credentials.\n\nHere's how Italy could line up against Luis de la Fuente's Spain in Group B of Euro 2024.\n\nGK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - His tournament couldn't have got off to a worse start but Donnarumma made a big save to preserve Italy's victory on Saturday.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - The steady right-back previously thrived under Spalletti at Napoli and Di Lorenzo will play a prominent role for Italy this summer.\n\nCB: Gianluca Mancini - The Italian media are reporting of the manager making a few changes to his team to combat Spain's threat on Thursday. Mancini, an aggressive defender who loves contact, could be brought in to man-mark Alvaro Morata.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - Inter's classy centre-back restored parity against Albania which set the tone for a typically assured performance. Bastoni's header was just his second goal for the Azzurri.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - Spain may well play for an early throw-in down Dimarco's side given his antics on Matchday 1 allowed Albania to score the fastest goal in Euros history.\n\nCM: Jorginho - The Arsenal midfielder produced a typically efficient midfield display against Albania, but his defensive mettle and astuteness will be put to the test in Gelsenkirchen given Spain's dynamism in the middle of the park.\n\nCM: Bryan Cristante - Davide Frattesi may be used as a super sub on this occasion, with reports suggesting Spalletti is going to favour the physicality of Cristante.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - The Italian superstar netted the early winner to ensure the Azzurri's title defence got off to a winning start. Given the profiles in Spalletti's attack, Barella's goals may be key for them this summer.\n\nRW: Federico Chiesa - Chiesa has struggled to find his most potent form for Juventus since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament tear, but the Italian seems to save his best work for the national team. His performance against Albania was bright down the right.\n\nST: Mateo Retegui - Italy certainly aren't blessed with an array of premier strikers and Spalletti could already make a change. The energetic Genoa forward only earned his first cap in 2023 and may be preferred to Gianluca Scamacca for Thursday's huge Group B clash.\n\nLW: Lorenzo Pellegrini - With Dimarco flying down the left, Pellegrini very much functions as an auxiliary wide man.

That Spain came to the German capital of gridlock and found the most fluent performance of Euro 2024 was doubly impressive. Coming mere hours after the tournament's favourites plumbed new depths and arriving against the reigning champions means multiplying its significance a couple times more.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side, tantalising in attack, balanced and cohesive in the middle and thus far solid at the back, are motoring away from Gelsenkirchen, as impressive as any feat. The first team through to the last 16, the scoresheet saying progress came courtesy of a Riccardo Calafiori second-half own goal. It didn't. It came from Nico Williams who tormented Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Italy at large, serving up a stunning performance to match the one his counterpart on the other wing, teenager Lamine Yamal, provided against Croatia.\n\nHow far can they go? We can't yet say but we do know it will be worth the watch. Two games, two wins, four scored, none conceded and plenty of other numbers looking good for La Roja.\n\nThe tournament had reached its 18th game without a traditional scoreless draw, which is to say, one which finishes with the scoreboard untroubled. Yet the contest which preceded this, Gareth Southgate's latest masterpiece in under-delivery, was as spiritual a 0-0 as you'd see. Which meant Spain and Italy could get on with things knowing the scoreless fates weren't hovering above them.\n\nFamiliarity is supposed to breed contempt yet these are two blue bloods of the continent who mostly shrug and get on with meeting one another every four years, serving up some classics \u2011 and a couple of duds too. This was the fifth-straight Euros where the two met, including two get-togethers in 2012. Opening-day victories coupled with Croatia's draw with Albania Tuesday meant the pressure felt a little off. No one told Williams.\n\nThe real stresses were for the masses who made their way out to this place, which proved a nightmarish logistical location for England and Serbia fans on Sunday night - and into Monday morning. By kickoff here, the stands were packed again but, like a North Rhein industrial wasteland version of Hotel California, checking in isn't the problem.\n\nIt was however, essentially, the problem for Italy first time around when they arrived asleep, Albania taking all of 23 seconds to fire in a stunning opener. To their credit, Luciano Spaletti's side waited five times' as long to check in at AufSchalke Arena, Pedri unable to do what Nadim Bajrami had as the Barcelona midfielder headed Williams' cross at Gianluigi Donnarumma when he simply had to score. The clock hadn't hit two minutes but it was a sign of what was to come.\n\nThe minutes on the arena's giant scoreboard ticked along but somehow in an utterly dominant first half hour, the digit beside the word 'Spain' didn't. Williams was tormenting Di Lorenzo, slicing and dicing on the right. After 10 minutes he floated central and was found by a gorgeous Alvaro Morata cross. Like Pedri, he had to score. Unlike Pedri, he couldn't even hit the target, skewing his head wide.\n\nWhen Yamal found a groove on the opposite wing, Italy really had to start worrying, surely? The teenager turned beautifully after 23 minutes and jinked in to create an opening which Morata couldn't build on. Three minutes later Fabian Ruiz rifled a drive which Gianluigi Donnarumma tipped over. Closer to half-time the PSG midfielder would try again but hilariously fire the ball halfway back to town, beating the rush for the tram.\n\nRuiz was buzzing and Rodri was doing a lot of his metronome thing, Jorginho having as enjoyable a Wednesday as clubmate Declan Rice. Spain's defence was just as dominant, the last shot of the half Italy's sole effort, Federicho Chiesa firing well over. As the teams made their way off you assumed Di Lorenzo would fish out a number for Scotland's Anthony Ralston to start a tormented right backs club.\n\nThe two downsides of the first half for Spain were the lack of a goal and a yellow card for Rodri which ruled him out of the final group game. But if they could sort out the first problem, the second one would disappear. Spaletti tried to sort his own mess, removing Jorginho and the equally anonymous Davide Frattesi but Bryan Cristante came in and found Rodri's foot and a yellow card within 21 seconds. Hardly promising.\n\nWhat had been promised for so long finally arrived ten minutes into the half. That it came from Williams' wing was about the most reliable thing in this city. He jinked past Di Lorenzo yet again and sent a fizzing ball across which Morata got a flicker of hair on. Donnarumma's touch was even more slight but enough to leave Calafiori helpless. The scoreline finally ticked where it should have been much sooner.\n\nThe chances for it tick again flowed freely now: Robin Le Normand having a header cleared off the line and Yamal trying to spellbind one inside the post from distance. Spaletti made two more changes because why not? A wake-up call did arrive when Cristante surged forward and sent one across the Spanish goal on 67 minutes. Soon after Williams cut in from his side and crashed one emphatically off the woodwork.\n\nItaly, beyond belatedly, provided a little something. Not much, not nearly enough but something. Aymeric Laporte and the Spanish defence, the lingering not-yet-known, tired a little. But they saw it out, Ayoze Perez botching two late chances en route. No matter. Rodri can rest up. Plenty of road to travel yet.\n\nSPAIN (4-3-3): Unai Simon 7; Carvajal 7, Le Normand 7, Laporte 7, Cucurella 7; Pedri 7 (Baena 71), Rodri 8, Ruiz 8 (Merino 90); Yamal 8 (Torres 71), Morata 7

outclassed Italy", "body": "Riccardo Calafiori's own goal handed Spain a 1-0 victory over defending champions Italy as they booked their place in the last 16 at Euro 2024.\n\nThe defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nWilliams himself passed up a glorious 10th-minute opportunity to open the scoring when he contrived to head wide from Alvaro Morata's equally inviting cross with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.\n\nListen to the RT\u00c9 Soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWatch every game from Euro 2024 on RT\u00c92 and RT\u00c9 Player as well as highlights

sends Spain into last 16 | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Riccardo Calafiori's own goal handed Spain a 1-0 victory over defending champions Italy as they booked their place in the last 16 at Euro 2024.\n\nThe defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nWilliams himself passed up a glorious 10th-minute opportunity to open the scoring when he contrived to head wide from Alvaro Morata's equally inviting cross with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Williams had been everywhere but still had one more trick: Italy had compromised their gameplan in an attempt to finally subdue the thrilling Spain winger, but Williams carried the spirit of this young team and simply went again as he found the avenue to his left. A moment that had been building since kick-off finally arrived as Williams produced the cross that led to Riccardo Calafiori's own goal. By the end, Spain had battered Italy 1-0.\n\nEven as Luis de la Fuente's side sealed their place in the last-16 with a game to spare, Spain deserved more. For the best part of an hour, they tore the holders Italy apart, led by Williams and his evisceration of Di Lorenzo. Spain really should have found the goals to seal a statement victory such a performance had merited, one of fearlessness that was summed up by irrepressible displays from their young winger Williams, and the even younger 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Italy, who hung on to set up a nervy ending, were far from looking like the champions of three years ago.\n\nIn that, Spain earned some revenge for their semi-final defeat at Euro 2020, while looking like a more complete side from that tournament. La Roja are certainly more exciting and have certainly more than matched Germany with their first two performances. But if the hosts have been carried on by their own sense of momentum, Spain are generating theirs. The fearlessness of Williams and Yamal to run and run, terrorising their full-backs, offers Spain considerable energy as well as skill. Spain were alive and electrified, all over the pitch.\n\nThat includes a magnificently committed performance from Marc Cucurella, the Chelsea defender who looked like he would not make the squad a couple of months ago before his club form turned around. The left-back was excellent against Italy's Federico Chiesa, flying into challenges as if his life depended on it, his mane flowing wildly. It meant Italy, despite their ambition before the game to control possession, couldn't gain a foothold. The commanding Gianluigi Donnarumma kept Italy in it with a series of excellent saves but unlike the Wembley penalty shootout victory over Spain three years ago, he couldn't be the hero.\n\nThe meeting of Spain and Italy for a fifth European Championship in a row and the latest chapter of the most played rivalry of the tournament's history brought the biggest night of Euro 2024 so far. If the group stages of the tournament have been defined by the efforts of the unfancied nations seizing their moment, such a Turkey and Georgia taking swings at each other for 90 minutes in the rain in Dortmund, Spain brought a different level of intensity as they met the holders Italy and wiped them off the park for the best part of an hour.\n\nAll that talk before the game about Italy wanting to control possession and Spain accepting they were more dangerous without the ball? Well, old habits die hard. Spain dominated and, from the very start, it was impossible to look away from Williams. The 21-year-old missed the biggest chance of the first half when he headed wide Alvaro Morata's excellent whipped cross at the back post, but Williams kept on going, finding he had the beating of Di Lorenzo inside and out.\n\nOn the other wing, Yamal drew the first ooos from the crowd with an elegant spin, then had everyone on their feet as he lowered his head, steadied for the contact, and then emerged as if he was floating through the air. A magnificent run fell to the feet of Morara and, from the angle, Donnarumma blocked his shot with his feet. By then, Donnarumma had tipped over Pedri's header, set up by who else but Williams, before he managed to get the slightest touch on a rising strike hit ferociously by Fabian Ruiz.\n\nIt capped a frantic period where Italy couldn't get out and the Spain breakthrough felt inevitable. Italy made it to the break having been restricted to one effort on goal and attempted to regroup. Luciano Spalletti made two changes at the break with his ambition up in smoke, bringing off Jorginho and Davide Frattesi, sacrificing control in the middle for numbers on the outside - specifically, the side of Williams.\n\nOn came Andrea Cambiaso and Bryan Cristante, the former positioned ahead of the struggling Di Lorenzo. Cambiaso may have looked at the Spain winger's treatment of Di Lorenzo and run onto the pitch with wobbling legs. In any case, Italy failed to shut down the Spain left. Pedri could only steer wide from Cucurella's cut-back moments after the restart, as Italy retreated further and abandoned Spalletti's principles with a series of alarmed, rushed clearances.\n\nThen, finally, the moment came, and to no one's surprise it was Williams again, flying at Di Lorenzo and Cambiaso and beating them both. The ball was flashed across the face of goal and although Spain were missing a forward presence, Williams found an area where it caused panic: his cross took a deflection before a touch from the diving Donnarumma sent it into the knee of Calafiori. The centre-back, who carries a hapless air alongside occasional brilliance, fell to to the ground as it deflected in.\n\nSpain kept flowing forward and, thrillingly, trying new things. Yamal bent a stunning shot inches wide of the bar post, and then Williams attempted the same, crashing a thunderous hit off the crossbar as if they were in competition with each other.\n\nThe end of the game turned when Yamal and Williams were brought off, with Spain falling back. Italy survived long enough and suddenly felt as if they were going to get a chance, heads lifting like a rising corpse. A Calafiori header flashed wide but nothing else of substance came, even as Donnarruma went up for a late corner.\n\nIt would have been a robbery had Italy nicked something, and in holding out Spain learned something else too. Often, the most watchable exciting team at the tournament does not win it, and are found to be missing something by the latter stages. But Spain, with this new generation, look like they will be going further than many expected. Like Yamal and Williams, their potential appears to rise with every game.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The result means Spain are now guaranteed to top Group B after hammering Croatia in their opener.\n\nSpain finish up the group stages against Albania next Monday, with Italy taking on Croatia in their third and potentially final match of Euro 2024.\n\nIt took a little over a minute for Spain to deliver the first punch in the battle of two international giants. Nico Williams' delicious cross to the penalty spot picked out an unmarked Pedri and the Barcelona midfielder's header forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a smart stop.\n\nSpain were guilty of squandering another glorious opportunity in the tenth minute as they sliced through the reigning European champions. Alvaro Morata was provider on this occasion with a devilish delivery to the far post, but Williams inexplicably sent his header wide from just six yards.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side continued to bamboozle their opponents as the half wore on, playing almost exclusively inside Italy's final third. However, they couldn't make their advantage count, with Donnarumma standing tall to keep out testing efforts from Morata and Fabian Ruiz.\n\nDespite a dominant first half display in Gelsenkirchen, Spain were unable to find the all-important breakthrough. Their profligacy in the final third meant the match entered the second half finely poised, with Italy in need of significant improvements across the pitch.\n\nSpain continued to overrun Italy after the restart but were once again left ruing their wastefulness. Pedri, who should have opened the scoring early in the first half, was picked out by Marc Cucurella inside the penalty area, but the 21-year-old was unable to sort his feet out as he rifled wide from close range.\n\nHowever, it mattered little three minutes later as La Roja took the lead - even if it wasn't a Spanish name on the scoresheet. Morata's near-post flick was palmed out by Donnarumma, but the ball ricocheted off the leg of Calafiori and trundled into the back of the Italy net for the fifth own goal of the tournament.\n\nItaly showed few signs of netting an undeserved equaliser but with only a goal between the sides, Spain couldn't afford to take their foot off the gas. Williams did his best to establish a two-goal cushion but his powerful strike slammed the crossbar with 20 minutes remaining.\n\nHowever, despite not adding to their lead following several late openings for substitute Ayoze Perez, Spain did manage to hold on under minimal pressure from a disappointing Italy side.\n\nGK: Unai Simon - 6/10 - A passenger for the majority of the game, doing far more work with his feet than with his hands.\n\nRB: Dani Carvajal - 7/10 - Rarely threatened by Italy's wide players and enabled Cucurella to roam down the left flank by tucking in when required.\n\nCB: Robin Le Normand - 6/10 - Took a few blows to the head throughout but they didn't knock him off his stride. Booked for a late challenge on substitute Mattia Zaccagni.\n\nCB: Aymeric Laporte - 7/10 - Despite being an injury concern heading into the clash, the Al Nassr centre-back showed no signs of weakness. Dealt with Gianluca Scamacca effectively.\n\nLB: Marc Cucurella - 8/10 - Played like a man possessed, winning duel after duel up against the misfiring Federico Chiesa. Provided plenty of attacking support down the left-hand side too.\n\nCM: Pedri - 7/10 - Should have put Spain ahead in the early stages of both halves but finishing aside, it was a terrific display from the diminutive magician. Floated across midfield and was always in space as Spain carved open Italy's backline.\n\nCM: Rodri - 8/10 - Composed, elegant and unflappable. Exactly what we have come to expect from Rodri, with the only frustration being that he will miss the clash with Albania due to suspension - not that it matters anymore given Spain have topped Group B.\n\nCM: Fabian Ruiz - 8/10 - A graceful display from the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, who often provided the key pass in the final third. His wand-like left foot orchestrated many of Spain's attacks.\n\nRW: Lamine Yamal - 8/10 - Yeah, this fella shouldn't be 16. Showcased his quick feet regularly with some neat tricks and flicks, almost curled a beauty beyond Donnarumma from 25 yards out and generally tortured Federico Dimarco on the right flank.\n\nST: Alvaro Morata - 7/10 - Knitted play together neatly when the ball turned over and his near-post header forced Spain's opener.\n\nLW: Nico Williams - 9/10 - Left Giovanni Di Lorenzo chasing shadows with an electric display in Gelsenkirchen. Terrorised the Napoli defender from start to finish and had the crowd purring every time he got his foot on the ball.\n\nSubs not used: Alex Remiro (GK), David Raya (GK), Alejandro Grimaldo, Daniel Vivian, Jesus Navas, Nacho Fernandez, Dani Olmo, Fermin Lopez, Martin Zubimendi, Joselu.\n\nLuis de la Fuente - 8/10 - A truly dominant display from Spain against a well-stacked Italy side. Bodes well for La Roja moving forward after convincing victories in their opening two games.\n\nGK: Gianluigi Donnarumma - 6/10 - Made some important saves to stop Spain from filling their boots. Perhaps could have done better with Spain's goal.\n\nRB: Giovanni Di Lorenzo - 3/10 - A chastening experience for the full-back as Williams drove at him relentlessly. Often had to resort to hauling the winger to the ground, or simply watching him sprint away.\n\nCB: Alessandro Bastoni - 6/10 - Made an important intervention to deny Williams during the first half and didn't put a foot wrong on elsewhere.\n\nCB: Riccardo Calafiori - 6/10 - A largely composed display from the young Bologna defender, who was extremely unfortunate to leave the field with an own goal to his name.\n\nLB: Federico Dimarco - 4/10 - Struggled to cope with Yamal's blistering speed and nimbleness, while failing to provide any danger in the Spain half.\n\nDM: Jorginho - 5/10 - Couldn't offer any control or security in Italy's midfield and was withdrawn for the more physical Bryan Cristante at half-time.\n\nRM: Federico Chiesa - 4/10 - Toothless when he received possession and had no joy up against Cucurella. Surrendered the ball far too easily when supplied by his teammates.\n\nCM: Davide Frattesi - 5/10 - Anonymous throughout a poor first half for Italy, barely managing a kick. Hooked at half-time by Luciano Spalletti.\n\nCM: Nicolo Barella - 6/10 - The best performer in an Italy midfield that was completely dominated by Spain's technicians. At least offered his teammates options when they tried to play out from the back.\n\nLM: Lorenzo Pellegrini - 5/10 - Apart from a few fouls, the Roma man couldn't influence proceedings and was sloppy on the left-hand side.\n\nST: Gianluca Scamacca - 5/10 - Completely isolated in the first half, touching the ball just 12 times. Things didn't improve after the break despite one clever turn on the halfway line.\n\nSUB: Bryan Cristante (46' for Jorginho) - 5/10 - Impressively booked within 20 seconds of coming on - the fastest of any substitute in Euros history.\n\nSUB: Andrea Cambiaso (46' for Frattesi) - 6/10 - Italy were a little better after his introduction, but that's more telling of their first-half display.\n\nSubs not used: Alex Meret (GK), Guglielmo Vicario (GK), Alessandro Buongiorno, Federico Gatti, Gianluca Mancini, Raoul Bellanova, Matteo Darmian, Michael Folorunsho, Nicolo Fagioli, Stephan El Shaarawy.\n\nLuciano Spalletti - 4/10 - He will be bitterly disappointed with his side, who simply couldn't match Spain on or off the ball. They're yet to convince at Euro 2024 and were particularly disappointing going forward.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

last 16 of Euro 2024 with a match to spare on Thursday after beating Italy 1-0 in a dominant display which ensured that La Roja would go through as Group B winners.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori's own goal nine minutes after half-time was the difference between the two sides at Gelsenkirchen in the biggest match to date at the tournament in Germany.\n\nBut the slender margin of victory didn't reflect a statement performance from Spain who completely nullified Italy and should have had the game won by half-time, as they did in their opening round thumping of Croatia.\n\nNico Williams was the star for Spain as he ran Napoli right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo ragged and supplied the cross from which the unfortunate Calafiori poked the winning goal into his own net.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's team have a perfect six points at the top of the group and take on Albania on Monday knowing that they are already in the knockout rounds and playing like potential champions.\n\nFor Italy Thursday's deserved defeat was a reality check as vibrant Spain peppered the brilliant Gianliugi Donnarumma's goal throughout the match while the Azzurri failed to have a single attempt on target.\n\nIt was a performance reminiscent of the Euro 2012 final between the two teams when Spain crushed Italy 4-0 in the last international hurrah for tiki-taka football.\n\nHowever all is not lost for Luciano Spalletti's team, who are second on three points, as a draw with Croatia on Monday will be enough to guarantee qualification behind Spain.\n\n- Williams shines for Spain -\n\nSpain could have been ahead twice in the first 10 minutes but squandered two great headed chances.\n\nLess than two minutes were on the clock when an unmarked Pedri nodded Williams' pinpoint cross straight at Donnarumma.\n\nAnd then Williams, who had a field day against Di Lorenzo, was the guilty party by somehow heading wide Alvaro Morata's superbly delivered, inswinging ball from the left flank.\n\nSpain were clearly on top as Italy struggled to get out of their half, Gianluca Scamacca toiling on his own up front with little support and wasting possession when it did come his way.\n\nDonnarumma had to be at his best twice within a matter of seconds when he first stuck out a foot to deny Morata and then pulled off a superb fingertip save which kept out Fabian Ruiz's powerful drive from distance.\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the pitch Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon was a virtual spectator as Italy's sole shot in the first half came just before the break when Federico Chiesa blazed a poor effort over from a difficult position.\n\nThe same pattern of Spanish possession and Italian defending continued after half-time and Pedri again wasted a great chance in the 51st minute, slamming wide after Marc Cucurella pulled back a perfect low cross.\n\nBut Spain got the breakthrough soon after and it came through more sensational play from Williams on the left, who made mincemeat of Di Lorenzo before fizzing across a ball which Calafiori couldn't help but divert into his own goal.\n\nLa Roja went close to doubling their lead with two distance strikes from Morata and teen sensation Lamine Yamal, before the superb Williams smashed an effort past Donnarumma which came crashing out off the crossbar in the 71st minute.\n\nItaly pushed forward in hope of an equaliser after Mattia Zaccagni and Mateo Retegui replaced the ineffective Chiesa and Scamacca.\n\nBut in the dying moments Donnarumma again made two superb saves to twice stop Ayoze Perez making the scoreline better reflect a one-sided contest.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Until they did.\n\nAn own goal from Riccardo Calafiori in the 55th gave Spain a 1-0 over the defending champion Azzurri in an entertaining encounter from Gelsenkirchen in Group B action at UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nIt was the 12th meeting between the two sides and the fourth in a row at the quadrennial tournament, a Euro record.\n\nSpain got on the front foot from almost the opening whistle with Nico Williams leading the attack on a number of occasions. The Athletic winger was a menace on the right, putting Giovanni Di Lorenzo through the paces at almost every turn. Williams nearly got things started in the second minute. His service into Pedri was on point, but Gianluigi Donnarumma was up to challenge and turned aside the Barcelona man's header.\n\nIn the 11th, it was Williams himself who came close. Latching on to a fine cross from Alvaro Morata, Williams sent his header over the bar.\n\nMidway through the first frame, Donnarumma needed a double save to keep the match scoreless. First he parried away an effort from Morata at a sharp angle before denying Fabian Ruiz from distance in the 26th with a diving stop.\n\nThe two teams headed into the break scoreless with La Roja well aware that a more clinical team would be ahead, potentially by multiple goals.\n\nThe second half began much the way the first did with Spain on the front foot, forcing the Azzurri to keep men behind the ball.\n\nThe dam finally burst for Italy in the 55th.\n\nIt was Williams who once again got things going. He whipped a cross to the front of the net for Morata, who deflected it on goal. Donnarumma parried away, but directly into the path of Calafiori and the Bologna man turned the ball into his own net.\n\nUp a goal, Spain kept coming. In the 59th, a Robin Le Normand header looked like it was going to sneak inside the post if not for the intervention of Andrea Cambiaso. Only two minutes later, 16-year-old Lamine Yamal went just wide with what would have been a special goal.\n\nDonnarumma then kept his team alive once more in stoppage with a pair of fine saves on second-half substitute Ayoze Perez.\n\nSpain saw out the 90 and were full value for the victory. The Azzurri offered very little going forward and barely troubled Unai Simon.\n\nWith Croatia and Albania's 2-2 draw on Wednesday, Spain clinched a spot in the Round of 16 with a victory ahead of Matchday 3.\n\nGroup B wraps up action on Monday with Albania meeting Spain in Dusseldorf and the Azzurri facing off with Croatia in Leipzig.\n\nSpain will be without Rodri for the match after the Manchester City midfielder picked up a second yellow card.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro",

Well, this was a dominant and confident display that suggests otherwise. Brilliant performance.\n\nAymeric Laporte - 7\n\nMuch like with N'Golo Kante, it is a real head-scratcher why a player of this quality is spending prime years playing in the Saudi Pro League. Was a calming presence next to Le Normand and he restricted Gianluca Scamacca to nothing.\n\nAymeric Laporte (right) produced a solid display which raises questions why he is plying his trade in domestic football in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr\n\nRobin Le Normand - 6.5\n\nA rising star in the game but he can be rash and did give some free-kicks away in dangerous areas here which won't have pleased his manager. The Real Sociedad centre back is not afraid to be physical and now it's about refining his reading of the game.\n\nDani Carvajal - 6.5\n\nWith Lorenzo Pellegrini and Federico Chiesa falling flat on the night, this was perhaps an easier assignment than the Real Madrid veteran may have anticipated. Knows the dark arts well and used his experience to slow this down when Italy felt like they were on the cusp of building some momentum.\n\nRodri - 7\n\nThe ease at which he can run a game has become taken for granted but Italy couldn't get near Spain's midfield and he was a large reason why. Picked up a silly booking in the final seconds of the first half and will now miss final group game against Albania. Booked.\n\nFabian Ruiz - 7.5\n\nWhat a player he is. Magnificent in the opening game against Croatia and this was another statement display from the Paris Saint-Germain star. By the end of the night he had his markers - plural - heads spinning.\n\nFabian Ruiz has been one of this tournament's best and this was another dazzling display\n\nPedri - 7\n\nReally should have scored but this was another display that reminded folk just why this player is going to establish himself as one of the world's best in his position.\n\nRead More The 16-year-old Euros star doing homework between games: Lamine Yamal is the wonderkid with a secret\n\nNico Williams - 8\n\nOne of the performances of the tournament so far. This was a magical display that was direct, exciting and had Italian defenders heads' spinning. It was his cross that, with the help of an Alvaro Morata header, led to the opening goal. He then smashed a curling effort onto the crossbar which would have been a goal this thrilling display deserved. MOTM.\n\nAlvaro Morata - 6\n\nWas too comfortable drifting out wide in the early stages when he needs to retain his poacher's instinct to stay within the posts. It was his near-post header which helped lead to the opening goal and he was unfortunate not to have another assist to his name earlier in the contest.\n\nLamine Yamal - 6.5\n\nThe fearlessness with which this 16-year-old is a frightening prospect for years to come. Almost produced one of the goals of the tournament when he narrowly missed the top corner with a curling effort in the second half.\n\nCOACH: Luis de la Fuente - 7\n\nThey arrived at this tournament with little expectation given the youthful nature of this group but he is managing to put players in positions to maximise their skill-sets. Take note, Gareth Southgate.\n\nLuis de la Fuente is successfully putting Spain's youngsters into the best positions to succeed\n\nSUBS\n\nAlex Baena (for Pedri, 71) - 6.5\n\nFerran Torres (for Lamine Yamal, 71) - 6\n\nAyoze Perez (for Alvaro Morata, 78) - 6.5\n\nMikel Oyarzabal (for Nico Williams, 78) - 6\n\nMikel Merino (for Fabian Ruiz, 90+4)\n\nITALY (4-3-3)\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma - 7\n\nWas incredulous when he was booked for dissent, despite being allowed to speak to the referee in his role as captain. Made a number of crucial stops in the first half when Spain peppered his goal but there was little more he could do for the opening goal.\n\nFederico Dimarco - 6\n\nWas the better of the two Italian full-backs on the night in that he was at least able to make life hard for 16-year-old Lamine Yamal. Offered little for Spain to think about at the other end, though, and that needs to change.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori - 6\n\nHardly had a moment to react before the ball cannoned in off his knee to give Spain a deserved lead. Alvaro Morata's header was tipped by Donnarumma and it was in before Calafiori even knew it was at his feet.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni - 6.5\n\nProvided a good jousting partner in his battle with Alvaro Morata and made a number of key interceptions when Italy found themselves under the cosh. The 25-year-old has the skillset that should see him as a man in real demand among England's elite in the coming years.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni (back) was one of the few bright spots on a difficult night for Italy\n\nGiovanni Di Lorenzo - 5.5\n\nA long, long evening for the 30-year-old. He was totally dominated here by Nico Williams and he was turned inside out with some ease for Williams' cross to tee up the opening goal. Will become an easy target if Italy progress much further in this tournament.\n\nJorginho - 6\n\nHooked at half-time. It was tough going for the Arsenal man in the 45 minutes he was on the pitch as Spain dominated in midfield through the brilliance of Fabian Ruiz, Rodri and Pedri. Played his part at making sure Italy were disciplined enough to remain at 0-0 at the break.\n\nNicolo Barella - 6.5\n\nWas left writhing in pain early in this contest after a nasty whack from Le Normand, and thereafter he struggled to take the game by the scruff of its neck. Technically sublime when he gets on the ball but this was a night where he and his team-mates found themselves suffocated as soon as they set foot in Spain's half.\n\nDavide Frattesi - 5.5\n\nA largely peripheral figure in a first half which was gruelling for Italy's players, who spent most of the time running after darting red shirts. Was part of a double change at the break as Luciano Spalletti desperately tried to stem the tide.\n\nDavide Frattesi left a lot to be desired and it was no shock to see him hooked at half-time\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini - 6\n\nOn a night where Italy had 42 per cent of the ball, service into the frontmen was limited to say the least. Seemed to get swallowed up by the game as his influence waned - quickly.\n\nGianluca Scamacca - 5\n\nOffered next to nothing in truth. Italy's lack of a razor sharp striker is what many expect to hold them back from retaining their title and on this evidence, that theory has plenty of weight behind it.\n\nFederico Chiesa - 5.5\n\nLargely anonymous which won't do given his obvious talent. It was a frustrating display that perhaps explained why Juventus seem willing to move on from the winger this summer. Booked.\n\nCOACH: Luciano Spalletti - 6\n\nMade plenty of changes and was bold to make a double substitution at half-time. But, in truth, he got out-coached on the night and you don't say that too often with an Italy team. Still all to play for to progress and from there, a steep improvement needed.\n\nSUBS\n\nBryan Cristante (for Davide Frattesi, 46) - 5\n\nAndrea Cambiaso (for Jorginho, 46) - 5\n\nMattia Zaccagni (for

It leaves Italy second, with Croatia and Albania both on a point apiece ahead of the final round of games.\n\nHere are the player ratings for both teams from the match:\n\nUnai Simon, 7. Didn't have a single save to make all game. A very quiet night.\n\nDani Carvajal, 7. Won his challenges, kept play simple. Simply did what he needed to with his more attacking teammates in charge.\n\nRobin Le Normand, 7. Did well in his one-v-ones and took a few late hits from frustrated Italian forwards. Had a header cleared off the line.\n\nAymeric Laporte, 6. A quieter night than his centre-back partner after replacing Nacho in the lineup. Caught out by runs behind once or twice, maybe a sign he's still working back to fitness.\n\nMarc Cucurella, 8. Stuck well to his task of halting Frattesi and Chiesa. Didn't get forward too much but that was a good thing, as it left Williams space to keep raiding the flank. Another decent showing.\n\nRodri, 7. Not his most magnificent game ever in terms of progression and protection but the fact Spain were so dominant meant it was at times a stroll for him. Took a heavy challenge to the foot. Barely misplaced a pass.\n\nPedri, 8. Unstoppable with his clever movement and ability to nip past tackles. Best player on the park even if not the most spectacular one. Another who wasted chances in front of goal though.\n\nFabian Ruiz, 7. Almost scored a thunderous long-range effort, then tried his luck too often with half-chances. Kept Spain dominant with good on-the-ball work all night.\n\nLamine Yamal, 7. Great skill and pace from the right once more but should have scored within a few minutes. Bent a brilliant shot just past the post on the hour. Non-stop running and creativity.\n\nAlvaro Morata, 8. Some brilliant link-up play and working in the channels. Denied at the near post after some sharp movement in the box.\n\nNico Williams, 8. Very lively start but missed a sitter with a close-range header. Had Di Lorenzo on toast with his dribbles down the left flank and delivered the cross for the opener. Smashed the upright with a shot of his own.\n\nSubs: F. Torres 6, A. Baena 7, M. Oyarzabal n/a, A. Perez n/a, M. Merino n/a.\n\nGianluigi Donnnarumma, 7. Booked early on for complaining. Great tip-over from Ruiz's shot, but knocked a low cross into his own defender for an own goal. Made another two late saves to keep his team in it.\n\nGiovanni Di Lorenzo, 6. Williams bypassed him in the first couple of minutes and didn't stop the torment all night, though the right-back improved in those duels as time went on.\n\nAlessandro Bastoni, 5. Not one of his finest nights, mostly due to the fact he was afforded no protection to stop the crosses and through balls.\n\nRiccardo Calafiore, 5. Defended fairly well but the runners kept coming and he couldn't track them all alone. Lucky to escape a first-half booking and then turned into his own net after the restart.\n\nFederico Dimarco, 5. Didn't really get the chance to get forward in his usual manner.\n\nJorginho, 4. Totally overrun in midfield. Didn't have the agility to keep up with Spain's play and subbed at half time.\n\nNicolo Barella, 5. Foreceful at times to try and stop Spain scything through but couldn't really impact in an offensive sense.\n\nFederico Chiesa, 4. Got no change out of Cucurella in the first half and went left wing for the second, where his fortunes didn't improve and he was hooked soon after.\n\nDavide Frattesi, 5. Couldn't impact at all in the first half beyond a few fouls and attempted runs forward. Subbed at the break.\n\nLorenzo Pellegrini, 4. Anonymous from the left, went central after the double half-time sub to much the same effect. Just 33 touches as the team's primary playmaker says it all.\n\nGianluca Scamacca, 5. Tried his best to hold play up and bring others into the game from deep but with very little success. Subbed past the hour mark with Chiesa.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Le_Normand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin Le Normand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Sim\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unai Sim\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymeric_Laporte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aymeric Laporte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Frattesi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davide Frattesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Chiesa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Chiesa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lvaro_Morata", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lvaro Morata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluca_Scamacca", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gianluca Scamacca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Dimarco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Dimarco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferran Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Merino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Merino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/20/21/SEI209665251.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666783", "eventUri": "eng-9666783", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

A couple more in the second half. Let us ask again: where are the haters?\n\nDi Lorenzo 4 - The Napoli captain will see Nico Williams in his nightmares.\n\nBastoni 6.5 - Best defender in the country for a reason. It wasn't an easy night, but he won almost every duel. Five from six on the ground, plus 91% passing accuracy. Italy's defensive leader for the next decade.\n\nCalafiori 5.5 - The build-up could not be as fluent as against Albania and Spain's defenders attracted him outside the defensive line quite often. Unlucky with the own goal.\n\nDimarco 4.5 - Struggled against Yamal just as much as Di Lorenzo vs. Williams and never had a chance to run forward. A tough night.\n\nJorginho 5 - Couldn't play tidily due to Spain's ferocious pressing and was often forced inside the box, so Cristante came in during the break. (46' Cristante 5.5)\n\nBarella 5 - Frustrated by Spain's pressing. He did find space in the middle of the park a couple of times in the first half, but movements from the rest of the team were not quick enough. He looked discouraged in the second half.\n\nChiesa 5 - Nullified by Cuccurella, it was not surprising to see him subbed off. (64' Zaccagni 5)\n\nFrattesi 4.5 - Same as Jorginho. Spain's pressing prevented him from playing the ball as he wanted. Like Jorginho, he was subbed off at the break. (46' Cambiaso 5.5)\n\nPellegrini 5 - Tried to link up attack and midfield but he was also ground by the Spanish blender. (82' Raspadori N/A)\n\nScamacca 5.5 - It's not easy to win one-v-one duels, imagine dealing with two defenders simultaneously at all times. The Atalanta star squeezed past the Spanish centre-backs only once, but the following pass for Barella was quite poor. (64' Retegui 5.5)\n\nCoach: Spalletti 5 - He wanted to prove Italy were an 'important school of football', but the Azzurri finished with no big chances, just three shots and 0.16 xG against Spain's 1.68. Not enough intensity and technical quality to hope for a better outcome. The plan was ambitious, but it didn't work out.\n\nSpain: Unai Simon 6; Carvajal 7, Le Normand 6.5, Laporte 6.5, Cucurella 7; Pedri 7 (71' Baena 6.5), Rodri 7.5, Fabian Ruiz 7.5 (93' Merino N/A); Yamal 7.5 (71' Torres 6), Morata 6.5 (78' Oyarzabal 6), Nico Williams 8 (78' Perez 7)", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Di_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Di Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_December_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Bastoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Bastoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Donnarumma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Donnarumma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cristante", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Cristante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

dominated Italy but only had a solitary goal to show for it as they secured top-spot in Group B in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nSpain bossed the opening 45 minutes and Pedri and Nico Williams spurned fine chances to break the deadlock while Gianluigi Donnarumma was in inspired form in the Italian goal.\n\nNine minutes after the break Riccardo Calafiori scored an unfortunate own-goal from a Williams cross but try as they might Spain could not find a second as while Pedri missed another sitter and Williams thumped the woodwork while Donnarumma would simply not be beaten.\n\nItaly mustered a little late pressure but now face a crunch clash with Croatia on Monday to determine who will go through to the last-16 as runners-up.\n\nPedri should have put Spain ahead inside two minutes when he was left unmarked in the middle to meet Nico Williams' perfect cross from the left but his header was too close to Gianluigi Donnarumma who made a flying fingertip save.\n\nWilliams was giving right-back Giovanni Di Lorenzo a torrid time on the left flank but himself missed a sitter from an inswinging cross from Alvaro Morata on 10 minutes, ghosting towards the back post but sending his close range header flashing past the near upright in plenty of space.\n\nLamine Yemal slalomed his way into the box before feeding Morata who was driven wide before seeing an angled shot blocked by the feet of Donnarumma and moments later the keeper flew to his right to tip over a rasping long-range drive from Fabian Ruiz on 25 minutes.\n\nThe Spain pressure was unrelenting and Rodri first dragged a low shot wide of target and then saw a first-time strike blocked by Alessandro Bastoni after some slick approach play.\n\nBastoni came to the rescue with a timely intervention to prevent Williams from latching onto a reverse pass from Pedri in the box while Fabian Ruiz whipped a first-time effort straight down the throat of Donnarumma five minutes before the break.\n\nItaly launched a rare foray forward before the interval but after being found on the right flank by Nicolo Barella's first time pass, Federico Chiesa drove towards the box before lashing high and wide.\n\nHalf-time sub Bryan Cristante - on in place of Jorginho - went into the book for a lunge on Rodri within 20 seconds of the second-half kicking-off - the fastest ever booking for a sub at a European Championships.\n\nPedri spurned another glorious chance when Marc Cucurella cut back from the left byline only for the Barcelona man to side-foot past the near post with the goal at his mercy.\n\nPedri then fired straight at Donnarumma from distance but the deadlock was broken moments later when Williams danced to the byline and fired in a cross which glanced off Morata's head and flicked the palm of Donnarumma, only diverting the ball into the knee of Calafiori who could not avoid turning the ball into his own net from close range.\n\nMorata stung the palms of Donnarumma as the onslaught continued and Andrea Cambiasso had to hook a header from Robin Le Normand off the line before 16-year-old Yamal curled narrowly wide from 25 yards.\n\nA rare Italian break saw Cristante flash a cross low across the face of goal but normal service resumed as Williams whipped a curling effort from the corner of the area which cannoned off the angle of post and bar with Donnarumma well beaten.\n\nInside the final 20 minutes Lorenzo Pellegrini floated a 25-yard free-kick over the crossbar, failin to trouble Unai Simon, who was largely a spectator throughout.\n\nAymeric Laporte - who was a fitness doubt before kick-off - nodded over an Alex Baena corner as Spain sought to put the result beyond doubt.\n\nTheir inability to put the game to bed saw Italy piling on some late pressure with Cristante's near-post flick from a corner being held by Unai Simon on 86 minutes.\n\nAyoze Perez was the last to be denied by Donnarumma after firstly tricking his way into the box and moments later latching onto a through-ball, but the keeper produced two fine low stops to deny him in a surely universal man of the match performance, though his attempt to score a dramatic equaliser at the other end from a stoppage-time corner was unsuccessful.\n\nSpain face Albania in Dusseldorf while Italy face Croatia in a winner-takes-all clash for runners-up spot in Leipzig on Monday night.",

They required the fortune of an own goal to break Italy's resistance and there were anxious moments near the end, but it was no more than they deserved on a night when Nico Williams electrified the Veltins Arena.\n\nVictory secured Luis de la Fuente's team a place in the last 16 and they must be one of the emerging favourites for Euro 2024.\n\nTheir best players are in the groove and winger Williams shone from the very start, creating the first chance in the opening seconds and rattling the bar towards the end with a fierce swerving drive before he left the pitch to a standing ovation.\n\nDefeat will not be terminal for Italy. They go on to face Croatia in Leipzig but the ease with which they were dominated by Spain does not bode well for Luciano Spalletti's men.\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: What Jude Bellingham must do to elevate his game LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

Italy looking to defend their title and Spain looking to become the first to win it for the fourth time. Although first game victories for both sides followed by a 1-1 draw on Tuesday between the teams they beat, Croatia and Albania, and the fact three will qualify from four groups seemed to draw some of the pre-match tension out of the atmosphere in Gelsenskirchen.\n\nRead More Rodri will MISS Spain's final group match after he receives a ban for breaking new Euro 2024 rule\n\nDe la Fuente's side impressed as they stormed into a 3-0 lead against Croatia by half time and they took the same approach here, with a brisk start and a header by Pedri forcing Gianluigi Donnarumma into the first save of the game within two minutes.\n\nWilliams tore down the left and delivered the cross. Pedri arrived late and Donnarumma turned it over. After conceding the fastest goal in Euros history against Albania in their first game, Italy would have been relieved to see their big goalkeeper come to the rescue.\n\nWilliams made a flying start to this one, as if offended by all the attention lavished upon 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal since the start of the tournament.\n\nYamal, on the right, is the youngest to ever play in a Euros, but Williams at 21 is another exciting young talent, electric for Athletic Bilbao in the season just ended. Here, he tormented Giovanni Di Lorenzo in the opening stages.\n\nFirst for Pedri's header, then another burst of scintillating pace, jinking past tackles to drag Italy's defensive unit out of shape before they smothered him and then a chance of his own that he really should have finished.\n\nIt was created by Pedri on the counterattack. Williams darted inside from left to right and Alvaro Morata spun wide into the space he left behind, collected a pass and picked out the winger with an excellent cross. Williams leapt to meet it, unmarked at the far post but his header skidded wide.\n\nThis was the perfect example of De la Fuente's new Spain. Dominant in possession and technically adept but willing to override their pure passing principles and strike more directly and quickly on the turnover. It gives them another dimension and makes them far more appealing to watch.\n\nYamal drifted inside from the right to sprinkle a little of his own stardust on affairs. The teenager is as much of a passer than a dribbler but he has the ability to do most things on the ball and he wriggled past two tackles before the ball spun fortuitously from another challenge towards Morata.\n\nDonnarumma produced another save, this one a block with his legs at the neat post, then turned over a sweet drive from distance by Fabian Ruiz. Again, a save he should make, above his head but his goal was under pressure.\n\nItaly resisted. It is one of the things they are good at. They were outplayed by Spain at Wembley in the semi-final of the Euros in 2021 and still beat them on penalties and won the competition. And while they might not boast the individual delights of their opponents, they have plenty of experience in the ranks.\n\nDonnarumma denied Morata again, and finally the Italians summoned their first effort on goal at the end of the first. Federico Chiesa eluded Marc Cucurella and blazed his shot high and wide. It was nothing more than a symbol that Italy remained in the contest.\n\nSpalletti had selected the same team that started against Albania but made two changes during the interval. Off came Jorginho and Davide Frattesi to be replaced by Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nThey seemed to come on with instructions to ruffle Spain and knock them from their rhythm. Cristante had only been on for a few seconds when he picked up a yellow card, leaving Rodri writhing in pain with a late tackle, studs into the top of his foot, but the pattern of play changed very little.\n\nSpain came forward. Italy defended. Pedri fired wide another chance wide, perhaps not as easy as it seemed such was the force of the pass rapped into his feet by Cucurella but the reaction of the young midfielder suggested he thought he should have scored.\n\nThen came the breakthrough with a hint of good fortune. Williams whipped in another cross, which was glanced on by Morata, forcing Donnarumma to react and reach for the low ball. The goalkeeper's intervention, however, only pushed it onto the left knee of centre-half Riccardo Calafiori and from there it pinged into the net.\n\nCambiaso made a vital clearance off the line to keep the lead to one, although, once behind, Italy had more purpose. Spalletti made further substitutions and they took risks as they chased a way back into the game.\n\nTheir supporters even stirred into song, but Williams rattled the frame of the goal and they fell silent again. When Donnarumma saved from Ayoze Perez near the end it was Spain's 20th attempt at goal. How they failed to win more comfortably was the big question.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

2024 knockout stages | Kickoff", "body": "Spain booked their spot in the last 16 of the 2024 European Championship with a 1-0 win over Italy on Thursday evening.\n\nThe Azzurri stuck with the same eleven that started the win over Albania, while the two-time champions recalled Aymeric Laporte and removed Nacho Fernandez in defence.\n\nItaly nearly conceded in the opening seconds for the second match running, but a tremendous one-hand save from Gianluigi Donnarumma smothered Pedri profiting Nico Williams' cross.\n\nThe roles were reserved ten minutes played where Williams this time got in a decent scoring position to meet a cross-field ball from Alvaro Morata, but he nodded wide from the back-post.\n\nItaly battled to get any sort of rhythm in attack going, and saw La Roja launch another threat when a powerful drive from range by Fabian Ruiz stung the gloves of Donnarumma.\n\nMorata, who was extremely lively across the front three, looked to get one in after coming from the blind-side but Donnarumma noted the danger and rushed out to parry him.\n\nAfter a torrid opening half, the Azzurri saw it fit to change the on-field personnel and in came Bryan Cristante for Jorginho before Davide Frattesi made way for Andrea Cambiaso.\n\nSpain continued to have the lion share of chances after the break and saw Pedri tuck wide from close-range off a cutback from the left of the area.\n\nLa Roja eventually got the breakthrough ten minutes to halftime as a flick-on by Morata from Williams' cross forced Riccardo Calafiori to bundle into his own net from close-range.\n\nWilliams stayed at the heart of every Spain attack in the latter stages where he came in from the left of the area to cut inside and rattle the top of the crossbar.\n\nThe Azzurri's rare foray came moments later when Lorenzo Pellegrini lined-up just outside the area to execute a free-kick, but ended going over the top.\n\nSpain missed a succession of chances to increase their tally courtesy of Ayoze Perez, but solid goalkeeping from Donnarumma kept him out.\n\nAlthough, it didn't matter a great deal as La Roja had done just about enough to see out the win which confirmed their last 16 spot,

last 16 at Euro 2024", "body": "The defender's misfortune 10 minutes after the break ultimately settled the Group B contest in Gelsenkirchen, although had it not been for the heroics of keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made a string of fine saves, and the crossbar, which denied the impressive Nico Williams a deserved goal, the Spaniards would have prevailed in some comfort.\n\nSpain would have been ahead within two minutes had Donnarumma not managed to tip Pedri's header from Williams' pinpoint cross over his bar, and the traffic was very much one-way in the early stages.\n\nWilliams himself passed up a glorious 10th-minute opportunity to open the scoring when he contrived to head wide from Alvaro Morata's equally inviting cross with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDonnarumma was called upon again twice within seconds, first blocking Morata's shot from a tight angle after good work by 16-year-old Lamine Yamal before turning Fabian Ruiz's searing drive over.\n\nWilliams was causing all kinds of problems for Giovanni Di Lorenzo down the Italian right, while Yamal was equally prominent on the other flank, but it was Ruiz who tested Donnarumma four minutes before the break with another sweetly-struck attempt from distance.\n\nItaly boss Luciano Spalletti opted for change at the break, sending on Bryan Cristante and Andrea Cambiaso for Jorginho and Davide Frattesi in a bid to gain a foothold, but Cristante was left walking a tightrope within seconds when he was booked for an ugly challenge on Rodri.\n\nPedri should have put the 2008 and 2012 winners ahead within seven minutes of the restart when he ran on to Marc Cucurella's pull-back, but stabbed wastefully wide, and although he did hit the target from 20 yards seconds later, Donnarumma was equal to the task.\n\nThe Italy keeper was finally beaten with 55 minutes gone when Morata flicked on Williams' cross and Donnarumma palmed it on to the helpless Calafiori, who could only bundle it into his own net.\n\nMorata saw a long-range attempt palmed over and Yamal curled another just wide as Spain went for the kill, prompting a response from the Italians which saw Cambiaso fire a dangerous ball across Unai Simon's six-yard box with substitute Mateo Retegui lurking.\n\nHowever, Williams rattled the crossbar with a swerving attempt which left Donnarumma helpless, although he had to be at his best to save from substitute Ayoze Perez twice at the death.", "source": {"uri": "rhyljournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rhyl, Prestatyn and Abergele Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Yamal's turn away from Demarco was a thing of beauty, matched by his driving run into the box before poking in to Morata.\n\nDonnarumma was equal to the task as the former Chelsea striker worked an angle to shoot.\n\nAnd the Italy captain saved his side once again with a flying leap and top hand stop to turn Fabian Ruiz' rising 25-yarder behind for a corner.\n\nIt felt as if a Spain opener was inevitable as the Italian back line rocked under the punches being thrown, blows to open them up for the potential knock-out, with di Lorenzo enduring a torrid night at the hands of Williams.\n\nTime and again, just as they seemed set to break, Italy found a block, a tackle, a barge, hoping against hope that the storm would eventually subside, Donnarumma holding firm under fire from Fabian once more.\n\nAt the break, despite parity, the Italians were shaking their heads as if they were seeking answers.\n\nLuciano Spalletti sought to find them by hooking Jorginho and Davide Frattesi, although Bryan Cristante's first act was to pick up a booking for a naughty foot-cruncher on Rodri.\n\nNot that it stopped Spain, who were only missing the finishing touch.\n\nPedri was wasteful again when he side-footed wide from 10 yards after glorious interplay between Williams and Marc Cucurella had sliced Italy apart once more.\n\nBut if Spain could not find a way past the holders, Italy would do it for them.\n\nWilliams, once more, destroyed Di Lorenzo, Morata got a flick and Donnarumma's desperate lunge only diverted against Califiori's left knee and back over the line.\n\nUnlike some teams we could mention, Spain did not sit back on their lead.\n\nDonnarumma denied Morata's long-ranger, with half-time replacement Andrea Cambiaso hooking Robin Le Normand's header off the line from the resulting corner.\n\nAs the Spanish fans roared, Yamal was a whisker wide before Williams cut it from the left to send the angle of post and bar shuddering after a stunning strike that left even Donnarumma for dead.\n\nThey only lacked a second to put the game to bed, Donnarumma making two more great saves to foil late sub Ayoze Perez in stoppage time.\n\nYet the gulf in class was cavernously wide. And the real worry for England, Germany and the rest, is that these Spaniards are only going to improve over the years to come.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It was a travesty of a scoreline for an unbelievably impressive performance from Spain, who could quite easily have won 5-0 without anyone thinking it was harsh on Italy.\n\nIt was absurd that the only goal was an own goal, too, although it does point to some familiar Spanish failings in terms of being unable to convert dominance into goals. Perhaps that will come back to haunt them in the knockout stage. But that's for a later date.\n\nFor now, let's marvel in probably the most cohesive performance of Euro 2024 thus far, when taking into account the quality of the opposition.\n\nAfter all, over the last couple of decades, Spain versus Italy has been arguably the main battleground in European Championships. They have faced one another in 2008, twice in 2012, 2016, 2020 and now in 2024. They are the only two nations to have won both the World Cup and the European Championship in the last 20 years. And, most pertinently, they've always been very different footballing nations.\n\nSome European nations go together neatly in football terms, but Spain and Italy are like oil and water. Returning to the first couple of questions, there's been a sense that Spanish football has somewhat looked down on Italian football in recent decades, considering its football defensive, tactical and old-fashioned. Therefore, Spanish players haven't ventured to Italy, and Spanish clubs haven't signed Italians.\n\nAs Spain's dominance of European football around 15 years ago became clear, they partly became the template for Italy. This was always a slightly controversial topic: some Italians are traditionalists, and want to compete as typical Italian sides. But they won the last European Championship under Roberto Mancini with a likeable brand of football, and the reigns of Cesare Prandelli, from 2010 to 2014, and Luciano Spalletti, since last year, introduced more positive coaches.\n\nThe Spanish influence has been notable by their use of multiple midfield playmakers. Prandelli often used Andrea Pirlo, Thiago Motta, Daniele De Rossi and Claudio Marchisio together. Mancini could depend on both Marco Verratti and Jorginho. That was the Spanish way.\n\n\"We must take the initiative,\" said Spalletti in his press conference yesterday. \"We must have courage to play the ball,\" agreed left-back Federico Dimarco. With Jorginho and Nico Barella in the engine room, perhaps Italy could compete.\n\nBut Spain have moved away from that approach of cramming as many playmakers into the side as possible. Whereas they once used David Silva and Andres Iniesta from the flanks -- essentially bonus No 10s -- now they use electric wingers.\n\nLuis Enrique was sacked after the World Cup 18 months ago, in part, because it was felt his obsession with possession play was too predictable. Luis de la Fuente's reign has been characterised by the idea that Spain are now more direct. In their opener against Croatia, they recorded less than 50% of possession in a competitive game for the first time since Euro 2008. It's about 'modernisation' and 'verticality'.\n\nAnd that verticality was obvious here, through their wingers. Down the left, Nico Williams produced the best individual performance of the tournament so far. Inside two minutes, he bamboozled Giovanni Di Lorenzo and crossed for a header that Pedro should have buried.\n\nEvery time Williams collected the ball, Di Lorenzo looked terrified, to the extent that Williams even beat him in the air at one point, which produced a wild Di Lorenzo hack to bring him down.\n\nHis fellow defender Alessandro Bastoni did the same thing shortly afterwards, almost out of sympathy. Di Lorenzo is not a flashy full-back -- he's in the side to be solid. And when your solid full-back gets beaten like this, time and time again, you know you're in trouble.\n\nOn the other flank, Dimarco didn't fare much better against Lamine Yamal, the competition's youngest player. Yamal dribbled inside to create a fine chance for Alvaro Morata. Later he cut inside and grazed the far post with a curling effort, which seemed to inspire Williams to do the same, cutting inside from the left onto his right foot and smashing the ball against the woodwork.\n\nThis genuinely felt like a new Spain, using more of an old-school Dutch-style 4-3-3, with wingers that wanted to take on their man, that could go inside or out, that could cross or dribble.\n\nWilliams' good work could have produced various goals, particularly when he dribbled at Di Lorenzo, who was scared to commit and backed off, allowing Williams to poke the ball inside for Marc Cucurella's underlapping run and cut-back. Somehow, Pedri sidefooted wide.\n\nEventually the goal came from a menacing Williams dribble, and his cross was deflected into the path of the unfortunate Riccardo Calafiori, who turned the ball into his own net, for yet another Euro 2024 own goal.\n\nItaly now produce Spain-style midfield passers but they still don't really produce wingers. Federico Chiesa, one of the revelations of the last European Championship, is perhaps a rare exception, although he also feels like a shooter rather than a dribbler from wide, much like his father Enrico, a fine second striker at the turn of the century.\n\nItalian wide players tend to be hard workers; tactically disciplined players who get through lots of running and allow the central players to shine. They don't stretch the play or beat a man. It felt typical that even Spalletti, an adventurous coach, felt minded to introduce Andrea Cambiaso -- a versatile, jack-of-all-trades wide player -- to double up against the brilliant Williams and shut him down. That's your Italian wide player. Not, of course, that he managed to stop Williams either.\n\nFor the first time, this really feels like a new era of Spain, a post-tiki-taka world, with Yamal and Williams the stars. In midfield, Rodri is another Sergio Busquets, Pedri grew up admiring Iniesta, and Fabian Ruiz is an assured, solid left-footed passer. More of that type of Spain. But now there's also speed, width, risk-taking and excitement.\n\nTonight, they were on a different planet to Italy. As always, these two footballing nations always feel very separate.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The collaboration is a component of the MTN Anti-Substance Abuse Programme, a multi-stakeholder initiative designed to reduce the incidence of first-time substance abuse among Nigerian youth aged 10 to 25 years. During the MTN Stakeholder Conference, held to mark the International Day Against Drug Abuse, the Chairman of the MTN Foundation, Prince Adelusi-Adeluyi, emphasised the critical need for the ASAP initiative. \u201cFive years ago, we examined the dire situation and concluded that something had to be done about the menace of substance abuse. We felt it was time to address the problem beyond boardroom speeches, leading to the birth of ASAP,\u201d he stated. According to Adelusi-Adeluyi, while drug abuse is a global issue, each nation must tailor its approach to address unique challenges. He expressed gratitude to the NDLEA and UNODC for their steadfast support over the years. Substance abuse remains a pervasive issue in Nigeria, further aggravated by high unemployment rates. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 5.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2023, up from 4.2 per cent in the previous quarter. This economic hardship has led many youths to turn to substance use as an escape, with studies indicating that 14.4 per cent of Nigerians aged 15 to 64 use drugs, nearly three times the global average. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Lagos State, Mr. Mobolaji Ogundele, representing the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, highlighted the state\u2019s commitment to tackling substance abuse. \u201cIn Lagos State, we have witnessed the devastating impact of drug abuse on families, communities, and the socio-economic fabric of our society,\u201d Ogundele said. He praised the ASAP initiative and the MTN Foundation\u2019s efforts, aligning with the state\u2019s vision to safeguard the future of Nigeria\u2019s youth. The Executive Director of the MTN Foundation, Odunayo Sanya, expressed gratitude for the partnership with Lagos State. \u201cLagos is unique; it is the economic nerve centre of Nigeria, and initiatives implemented here have the potential to be replicated across the entire country,\u201d Sanya noted.", "summary": "<p>The MTN Foundation has announced a partnership with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to combat substance abuse in Nigeria.

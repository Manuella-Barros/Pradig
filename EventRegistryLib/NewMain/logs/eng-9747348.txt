The boy at Arsenal [William Saliba] is world-class but he was sent out on a few loans first.\n\n'I don't know because United need two or three central defenders now. I want him to do well, I like seeing young players do well but what pressure is going to be on him.'\n\nMacAnthony also questioned whether Real Madrid were really interested in signing Yoro, who was also linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool before committing to Manchester United.\n\n'I don't believe the Real Madrid part because you don't choose Manchester United nowadays over Real Madrid,' he added.\n\nYoro, meanwhile, said of his move to United: 'Signing for a club with the stature and ambition of Manchester United so early in my career is an incredible honour.\n\n'Since my first conversations with the club, they set out a clear plan for how I can develop in Manchester as part of this exciting project, and showed a lot of care for me and my family.\n\n'I know about the history of young players at Manchester United and feel it can be the perfect place to reach my potential and achieve my ambitions, together with my new team-mates.

His dwindling contract left Lille scrambling to make a profitable exit despite Yoro's known preference for Real Madrid.\n\nMadrid were neck-to-neck with United in the race, but intended to delay signing until the summer in hopes of getting him on a free transfer in 12 months' time. Lille, aware and fear-struck by that prospect, didn't want to miss out on cashing in on their valuable player.\n\nREAD MORE: Man Utd's plan for Matthijs de Ligt now clear after signing completes transfer\n\nREAD MORE: 'World's hottest football WAG' wows in see-through red dress to launch Playboy deal\n\nEager to push the player to rethink, Marca, a Spanish news outlet, alleges Lille \"threatened\" to bench the 18-year-old for a full season if he rejected the move to England's top-tier league. Real displayed their unwillingness to pay market price by tabling around \u00a330m to secure Yoro just weeks earlier.\n\nThat was an offer firmly turned down by Lille as they were determined to fetch the highest possible amount for a standout star who made the Ligue 1 Team of the Year last season and holds great potential, reports the Mirror. United have subsequently secured the talented teen's services in what is their second summer signing following Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nDo you think Leny Yoro can solve Manchester United's defensive problems? Let us know in the comments section below\n\nDefensive frailties plagued Erik ten Hag's squad last season, leading to an insufficient number of goals and culminating in one of their worst Premier League finishes yet.

Details here", "body": "Manchester United signed French defender Leny Yoro from Ligue 1 side Lille until 2029. As per BBC, Yoro joins in a deal worth \u00a352.18m with a further \u00a36.73m in add-ons. The 18-year-old defender has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with the option for an additional 12 months. He becomes the second-costliest defender for United in their transfer history. Here are further details.\n\nManchester United are in the market for central defenders and they targeted Yoro. Notably, Real Madrid were one of the suitors but lost in their pursuit of the youngster after not deciding to pay the sum United did. With Raphael Varane gone, United have opted for a young player with an eye for the future. Matthijs de Ligt is expected to join next.\n\nYoro said signing for Manchester United so early in his career is an incredible honor. He added since his first conversations with the club, they set out a clear plan for how he could develop in Manchester as part of this exciting project. Yoro also said the club showed a lot of care for him and his family.\n\nYoro made 60 appearances for Lille, scoring three times. He made his first-team debut in 2021-22, playing one match. Last season saw Yoro feature largely. He played 44 matches in all competitions, including 32 in Ligue 1. He scored two league goals.\n\nAs mentioned, Yoro made 32 Ligue 1 appearances last season, scoring twice. As per Squawka comparison matrix (data by Opta), Yoro managed eight shots on target from 12 (excluding blocks). He attempted 1,874 passes, completing 1,727. He completed 392 passes in the opposition box. Yoro made 36 tackles and completed 8 take-ons. He also won 46 aerial duels and 58 ground duels.\n\nHarry Maguire's \u00a380m transfer in the summer of 2019 remains the most expensive signing for United in terms of a defender. Yoro beat the sum United spent on Lisandro Martinez, who arrive from Ajax in the summer of 2022. Martinez arrived for a sum worth up to \u00a356.7m. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is next. United shelled out \u00a350m for the right-back who arrived from Crystal Palace.\n\nUnited get a stable asset in their defensive ranks. He is calm and measured. A positive quality is he wins plenty of duels and is good on the ball in terms of possession. He is astute technically and has quality in terms of pace.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoro_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha\u00ebl_Varane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapha\u00ebl Varane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wan-Bissaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l520240720012021.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747348", "eventUri": "eng-9747348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Let's say Rio Ferdinand,\" Yoro told United media. \"I don't even know if I can explain this guy but he's a top defender and a really good guy.\n\n\"I just called him but I hope to meet him soon. Not today, but during the transfer market. He helped me a lot to make my choice, he explained how big United is, so it was really good for me.\"\n\nYoro's signing is the not only piece of significant business concluded by United this summer. Joshua Zirkzee has arrived from Bologna to provide competition for Rasmus Hojlund up front and there's a desire from club chiefs to sign another centre-back alongside Yoro.\n\nTwo bids for Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite have been rebuffed, leaving Matthijs de Ligt to be the primary target in United's crosshairs.

After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\n\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987-88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final.\n\nThe following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1-0 at Old Trafford.

It adds that Madrid were confident about signing Yoro - who they hoped would replace the outgoing Nacho - but were not willing to pay as much as the \u00a352m United paid.\n\nAfter United put in a much higher offer than Madrid, Lille then reportedly told the player he would not play for a year if he did not accept a move to the Premier League side - with Yoro 'seduced' by the lucrative terms on the table.\n\nBerrada has a big job at Old Trafford after his move to the club was announced in January as part of a shake-up of the hierarchy under new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe - with Dan Ashworth also joining as sporting director.\n\nYoro has become the latest addition and has signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford, saying it was \"an incredible honour\" to join the club after putting pen to paper with Erik ten Hag's side on Thursday.\n\nThe teenager said: \"Signing for a club with the stature and ambition of Manchester United so early in my career is an incredible honour. Since my first conversations with the club, they set out a clear plan for how I can develop in Manchester as part of this exciting project, and showed a lot of care for me and my family.\n\n\"I know about the history of young players at Manchester United and feel it can be the perfect place to reach my potential and achieve my ambitions, together with my new teammates. I cannot wait to get started.\"\n\nNew sporting director Dan Ashworth called Yoro \"one of the most exciting young defenders in world football\" and said he had every attribute to develop into a top centre back.\n\nYoro will link up with the United squad as they prepare for a big season - with Ten Hag's men setting off for a pre-season tour of the United States next week, beginning with a clash against Arsenal before taking on Real Betis and Liverpool in August.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Many believe the initial \u20ac62m (\u00a352.2m) they have paid Lille is above his valuation while others are already doubting his quality.\n\nYoro, 18, arrives at Old Trafford on a five-year deal, with the option for a further year, after United beat Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain to his signature. After being named in the Ligue 1 team of the year last season, Yoro emerged as one of the most in-demand defenders in Europe.\n\nThe France youth international emerges as United's second signing of the summer following Joshua Zirkzee's arrival and is expected to travel to the United States for their pre-season tour after Saturday's game with Rangers. Since his signing was completed, fans of rival clubs have made fun of United's decision to pay so much for a player so young.\n\nREAD MORE: United have learnt lessons from their scouting strategy in France with Leny Yoro deal\n\nREAD MORE: Matthijs de Ligt could grab dream Manchester United shirt number after Leny Yoro decision\n\nIn fact, many have already started to place doubt over his ability to adjust to the Premier League and improve Erik ten Hag's defence. However, anyone who has watched Yoro in action since his emergence in the Lille team will say differently and that's why MEN Sport has done the homework on the teenager so you don't have to. One of the most noticeable similarities between the two scouting reports from two French football experts is Yoro's comparisons to Raphael Varane.\n\nBefore he moved to England, Varane was widely recognised as one of Europe's best defenders after helping Real Madrid to four Champions League titles. When is his peak, not many central defenders could compete with his defensive knowhow and physical nature.\n\nThat version of Varane, the one that was colossal in Los Blancos' dominance in Europe, is what has been compared to Yoro. \"It might sound like a crazy comparison because he's come through in the Lille/Nord region, he was linked with Real, he's now at United - but Varane is a good comparison,\" Jeremy Smith told MEN Sport.\n\n\"Not the one United fans saw, though. Someone who clearly is a cultured defender, more of a cerebral type than purely physical, but who perhaps needs to learn his physicality a little more, while also gaining experience, in order to become a world-class defender.\"\n\nJonathan Johnson, another expert in French football, also pointed towards Varane's early days in his campaign when discussing Yoro's strengths and weaknesses. \"Yoro has few weaknesses to speak of,\" he said. \"He genuinely is a very complete player already and perhaps just misses the sort of experience that can only come with time and moving to a bigger club.\n\n\"He has it all and his reading of the game, positioning and imposing nature makes him a very tricky player to come up against. Think of Raphael Varane in his very early days.\"\n\nComparisons to Varane at his peak will be music to the ears of United fans. Fingers crossed the star signing can grow into his potential in England.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_holland@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Josh Holland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leny_Yoro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leny Yoro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoro_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Football in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapha\u00ebl_Varane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapha\u00ebl Varane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_youth_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national youth football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29577561.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2162573725.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747348", "eventUri": "eng-9747348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

In the space of 182 matches, the 'terrible child' of French football left an indelible mark on the hearts and memories of the fans, but also the history of the red entity.\n\nMultiple titles, exceptional qualities, 82 goals: the worthy successor to Manchester United's illustrious No 7s - Billy Meredith, George Best or Denis Law - has paid tribute to the legacy left by his predecessors, adding a new stone to the edifice himself. And so, more than two decades after the 'King', another phenomenon, Leny Yoro, with a relatively different style, is preparing to arrive at Old Trafford. Here's a portrait of another face that would look perfect in a crown.\n\nContract Details Transfer Fee, Salary & Contract Length\n\nAs announced by the Manchester United club itself, Yoro has committed himself to the Red Devils until 2029, with the option to extend for a further year. A meteoric rise for the 18-year-old from the Paris suburbs, whose future seemed to be written far from Great Britain. Paris Saint-Germain had expressed a keen interest in the defender, but never really took any action. This is in stark contrast to the position taken by Real Madrid, who tried to convince Lille to sell them their nugget for between \u00a321m and \u00a325.3. But the interest never seemed strong enough to conclude the deal, much to the delight of the United.\n\nWith a transfer fee of a cool \u00a352,1m, excluding bonuses (which could take the deal to a total of \u00a358.9m), the Lille man becomes the second most expensive defender in Manchester United's history, behind Harry Maguire, who arrived from Leicester for a cheque of \u00a373m in 2019. Domestically, he is also the biggest sale of a defender in the history of Ligue 1.\n\nIt was an operation masterfully managed by the Mancunian management, who were able to pull out all the stops by presenting a convincing project, as well as a competitive salary. The 18-year-old is set to earn a basic salary of \u00a3115,000 per week and \u00a35.98m per season. These sums could well increase if various bonuses are activated. According to estimates, he could earn up to \u00a3145,000 a week and \u00a37.54m a year.\n\nCareer\n\nIt's an investment that matches the potential of a player whose coach at LOSC, Paulo Fonseca, predicted last September that he had 'a great future ahead of him'. Although he has now established himself as one of the most sought-after defenders on the market (and as one of the best teenagers in the world), it is worth remembering that Yoro has still only played 60 professional games. After arriving at Lille's youth academy in 2017, it was against OGC Nice on the 14th of May 2022 that he took his first steps in the top flight.\n\nAt 16 years, six months and one day old, the young defender became the second-youngest player in history to wear the colours of LOSC (he has since been overtaken by Ayyoub Bouaddi), ahead of a certain Eden Hazard. A few months later, against Toulouse FC in November, he became the youngest Dogue - at 16 years and 308 days - to start a match in the top flight since Oumar Dieng in 1989. In statistical terms, he also became the fifth-youngest first-team starter in France's top flight in the 21st century, behind M'Baye Niang (16 years and 133 days), Eduardo Camavinga (16 years and 172 days), Rayan Cherki (16 years and 176 days) and Neal Maupay (16 years and 179 days). All the more reason to point the finger at his precocity.\n\nRelated 25 Best Young Players in World Football (Ranked)\n\nThe most gifted young footballers on the planet have been ranked in order.\n\n1\n\nMore and more used by Fonseca during the 2022/23 season (15 matches in all competitions), his status changed, as did his place in the hierarchy of Lille's central defenders. At only 17 years of age, Yoro has impressed, as evidenced by the words of his coach after his team's victory over Stade Rennais in February 2023.\n\n\"It's not normal for a 17-year-old player, who started the game with that mistake, to react like that. It's not normal, it's not common for a player his age! He's a very brave player.\"\n\nContinuing his progress, the following season was a real turning point for the young tricolour, who definitively established himself in the defence of Les Dogues - the nickname of LOSC. A long-awaited arrival for the man who now has the heavy responsibility of replacing veteran Jose Fonte, who left for SC Braga the previous summer. But nothing seems to be able to shake the player who was already being snapped up by numerous clubs last winter. Well aware of what the loss of his young talent would mean for his team, Fonseca did not hesitate to talk to him, in particular renewing his full confidence in him. It was a convincing speech and one that Yoro listened to wholeheartedly, deciding to finish the season in the north of France.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: No player under the age of 18 has played more minutes than Leny Yoro in the five major European leagues (2.673).\n\nStarting 41 times in 44 games in all competitions, the defender enjoyed his first real season in a starting role and even discovered Europe, through the Europa League, which he played in until the quarter-finals before his side was eliminated by Aston Villa.\n\nTransfer\n\nAnd while the season is drawing to a close and Yoro has been named in the league's best team, the 18-year-old's future already seems to be taking shape away from Lille, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain rumoured to be the most serious contenders for his signature.\n\nManchester United were not interested in these rumours, and have been lining up zero bids for the young defender. A sum that some will surely consider far too large, especially for a player whose contract was due to expire in June 2025. But talent waits for no one, and neither does the opportunity to acquire it.\n\nInternational Career\n\nHis outstanding performances quickly opened the doors of the French youth teams to the Lille diamond. And there too, his rise continued to go from strength to strength. In 2021, at the age of 15, Yoro made his debut for the Under-17s before moving up to the Under-18s a year later. At 17, he was called up by Lionel Rouxel to take part in France's qualifying campaign for Euro U19. He played two games (both as a starter) before finally being called up by Thierry Henry to join the French Espoirs team.\n\nWith the latter, he played in qualifying matches for the Euro U21 and established himself as the defensive stalwart. Logically expected to represent France at the 2024 Olympic Games, his participation was finally blocked by Olivier Letang, the chairman of LOSC, who claimed that his club 'cannot afford' to release its young players before the season. A questionable stance, especially given the young defender's immediate future.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nA centre-back accustomed to playing with four men, Yoro reads the game well. One of his strengths is to stick to his opponent's back so that the latter cannot turn around. This is a good way of forcing a foul and encouraging his teammates to recover the ball. It is worth pointing out, however, that Yoro is not - yet - a player who likes to rush into a duel and bases his game mainly on his sense of anticipation in trying to intercept the ball.\n\nHeight\n\nAt Lille, he was the second player to recover the most balls at the end of the 2023/24 season (36). His height is another important aspect of his profile. Standing at 1m90 (6ft2in), the defender is a real asset in aerial duels and proved it last season by being the LOSC player to win the most of them (44, or 63.8%). His right foot is also one of his strong points. Of his team, he is the second player to have attempted the most passes (1.880) and the one to have completed the most (1.731), with a 92.1% success rate - the fourth-best record in Ligue 1.\n\nRelated Leny Yoro's Stats Compared to Ruben Dias, William Saliba and Virgil van Dijk's\n\nAlthough just 18-years-old, Leny Yoro can already draw comparisons to current Premier League greats.\n\nHowever, this impressive total must be qualified by the fact that the vast majority of his passes were made inside his own half. This is one of his main areas for improvement, which, if worked on, could see him progress even further.\n\nPosition\n\nThe fact that Raphael Varane, a player whose career path is somewhat comparable to Yoro's, left Manchester United is no doubt a factor in the arrival of his young compatriot. Playing on the right side of a four-man defence, Yoro's future position would appear to be a natural one. Alongside him, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans should take it in turns to support him, while Harry Maguire could deputise.\n\nComparing Leny Yoro, Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez, Jonny Evans, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof's Stats for the 2023/24 season\n\nAppearances\n\nGoals\n\nYellow cards\n\nMinutes\n\nLeny Yoro\n\n44\n\n3\n\n5\n\n3.690\n\nRaphael Varane\n\n32\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2.211\n\nLisandro Martinez\n\n14\n\n-\n\n4\n\n900\n\nJonny Evans\n\n30\n\n-\n\n2\n\n1.600\n\nHarry Maguire\n\n31\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2.310\n\nVictor Lindelof\n\n28\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1.960\n\nAt just 18 years of age and with just one full season at the highest level, there is no doubt that young Yoro will need time to adapt. That period will inevitably be shorter at a club of Manchester United's stature, but the Frenchman will have to make the most of it to gain experience. Having finished eighth in the Premier League last season, the Red Devils will have to be far more impregnable (58 goals conceded, eighth worst defence in the league) than they have been if they hope to return to the top flight at the start of the 2024/25 season.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of FBref, Capology and Transfermarkt.

Yoro, 18, sealed a $67million transfer to Old Trafford on Thursday, which could potentially rise to nearly $77m with add-ons. He signed a five-year contract with an option for an additional 12 months.\n\nUnited acted swiftly to fill the void left by Raphael Varane, but there are questions about whether he can bolster Erik ten Hag's squad for the upcoming season.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer news LIVE: Adrien Rabiot latest, Alexander-Arnold update, Nico Williams 'bid'\n\nREAD MORE: Johan Bakayoko speaks out on future as Liverpool sent promising $54m transfer message\n\nDespite attracting interest from top European clubs due to his performances for Lille, the teenage defender is still developing and will undoubtedly be a work in progress. That is why Petit feels Yoro wasn't ready for the move to England, advising his former clubs Arsenal and Chelsea against signing him this summer.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN in April, Petit said: \"I know Leny Yoro well, I watch him in France, and he's been nicknamed the next Raphael Varane. He was 16 when he started with the Lille first team... and all of a sudden his life changed.\n\n\"The manager said he needed someone to repeat his age as he always was shocked at [how] young he is. In the space of two years, he's been an absolute rock in defence. Let Yoro improve step by step, right now it's too early.\n\nHow do you reckon Leny Yoro will fare at Old Trafford? Let us know in the comments section below.\n\n\"Saliba was [the] perfect example, he was at Arsenal early on but spent three years on loan before cementing his name in Arsenal's XI. The season Saliba did with Marseille changed everything and now he's one of the best defenders in the world.\"\n\nHowever, ex-United defender Rio Ferdinand was delighted with the move for Yoro. Ferdinand made a public plea for the club to sign the Frenchman on his podcast, and even sent him a congratulatory video when the teenager had signed his deal with United.\n\n\"Leny, Leny, Leny!\" said Ferdinand. \"How you doing bro? Listen, congratulations. Welcome to Manchester United man. I wish you all the best.\n\n\"I know you're going to work hard and that's the secret man, work hard, work hard, work, work, work on all the part of your game. You've got all the potential, you've got all the tools man. You've got everything there, ready to rock and roll, to go and make a big impact at this club. It's the best club in the world, it's a beautiful place to be.

Between now and then, United still have several more friendly matches to build up to the new season.\n\nUnited have already had their first pre-season friendly that ended in a 1- 0 defeat to Rosenborg earlier this week. Now the Reds will make the trip north of the border to face Scottish Premiership giants Rangers.\n\nTen Hag's team will travel to Ibrox for kick-off on Saturday, where the Dutchman will hope to give more valuable minutes to his players. There is one player in particular, though, that fans will be hoping to see in action.\n\nREAD MORE: United have learnt lessons from their scouting strategy in France with Leny Yoro deal\n\nREAD MORE: United suffer injury blow ahead of pre-season tour\n\nLeny Yoro is officially a United player after he completed a \u00a358.9million move from Lille on Thursday. United fended off competition from Liverpool and Real Madrid for the 18-year-old centre-back's signature.\n\nYoro has already been spotted training with his new United teammates just days after completing his move. He was seen being greeted by new teammates Mason Mount and took part in rondo passing drills.\n\nWhile Yoro certainly looked sharp, whether or not he will feature against Rangers remains to be seen. The centre-back's final appearance of last season came on May 19 for Lille against Nice in Ligue 1.\n\nYoro did not feature for his country following the conclusion of the domestic season and has been enjoying a summer break. Ten Hag will want to get Yoro some valuable minutes as soon as possible before the start of the Premier League campaign.\n\nA decision will be made on whether Yoro will make the trip to Scotland for United's friendly against Rangers, or if he will remain at Carrington to work on his fitness. It seems unlikely Ten Hag will thrust Yoro into his starting line-up so quickly after joining, although he could be named on the bench for the pre-season fixture.\n\nFellow new signing Joshua Zirkzee is not expected to be involved in the match against Rangers.

He was soon followed in by French defender Leny Yoro, a \u00a352million signing from Lille.\n\nVIDEO Ranking Every England Player At Euro 2024\n\nThe Red Devils were able to beat Real Madrid to the signature of Yoro, while Arsenal were one of Zirkzee's reported suitors. But after making this first splash in the transfer market, the books will have to be balanced.\n\nWith the club having posted a \u00a371.4million loss in their last set of quarterly accounts earlier this month, it would appear they have work to do in order to meet their Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR) commitments, meaning player sales are likely to follow this influx of signings.\n\nAnd according to ESPN, as many as seven players could be on their way this summer, should the club receive the right offer.\n\nThis seven consists of five players who have just entered the final year of their current contracts at Old Trafford, with defenders Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, plus midfielder Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen having all just ticked into the final 12 months of their deals.\n\nAdded to this quintet is Brazilian midfielder Casemiro, who has two years to run on his big-money contract, but was the subject of criticism during the run-in last season, plus disappointing forward Antony, who will be permitted a loan move if the club can find a suitor ready to subsidise his \u00a370,000-a-week salary.\n\nThe report adds that this is a significant change in policy at Old Trafford, as the Glazers would rather see players run down their contracts for them to leave on a free than spend money on replacements.\n\nManchester United are still said to be targeting a defensive midfielder and another centre-back this summer, with further moves depending on who they are able to move on.\n\nThe team face Rangers in a preseason friendly at Murrayfield on Saturday, before heading out to the United States for a tour that will see them face Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool before facing Manchester City in the Community Shield on August 10. They will then open their Premier League campaign by hosting Fulham at Old Trafford on August 16.\n\nManchester United moving in for Spain superstar as FOURTH summer buy: report\n\nTottenham to make shock move for Conor Gallagher alternative: report", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_mewis@fourfourtwo.com", "name": "Joe Mewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Wan-Bissaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Spanish Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Community Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FtF2eHUoDZx9J6FmokNYjK-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747348", "eventUri": "eng-9747348", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 2663, "textEnd": 2672}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 2761, "textEnd": 2770}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He impressed his coaches and made his league debut for Lille at just 16-and-a-half - some months younger than Chelsea legend Eden Hazard, Lille's greatest academy graduate, was when he had made his debut in this patch of north-east France.\n\nIf 16 sounds young to play as a defender in one of Europe's top five leagues, that's because it is - yet Lille boss Paulo Fonseca felt he had no choice.\n\nSuch was the quality and composure Yoro showed after being invited to train with the first team, his promotion into the side became inevitable. After a breakout 2022/23, he became an automatic choice last season.\n\n\"It's so rare to find a player aged just 18 with the maturity and technical qualities he has,\" Fonseca, now in charge at AC Milan, told French sports newspaper L'Equipe last year. \"For me, he will be one of the very best centre-backs, a top-class player, no doubt about it.\"\n\nThere was praise from some of Yoro's high-profile Lille team-mates, including former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Nabil Bentaleb and Canada international striker Jonathan David, too, while France's age-group coaches were similarly taken aback by him.\n\nYoro has made appearances for his country at Under-17, Under-18, Under-19 and now at Under-23 level, adapting to the standards whenever a new challenge has been set for him.\n\n\"His anticipation is very good, he reads the game excellently, he's good in the air and plays the ball out from the back well,\" France U-19 coach Lionel Rouxel told L'Equipe last year. \"There's room to improve his first touch, carrying the ball out from the back and that first key pass in the infield and down the wing. There's more to come in terms of his long passing game, too.\"\n\nSome of that more to come was on show in 2023/24. Across 30 starts in Ligue 1 last season, Yoro added a touch of aggression to his customary calmness, while exhibiting a growing sureness in the way he used the ball. Standing at 6ft 3in tall, he continued to impress in the air, winning 67.86 per cent of his duels.\n\nLille finished in fourth last season, with Yoro arguably their best performer. He earned a place on the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year five-man shortlist, while also being named alongside PSG and Brazil's Marquinhos as one of the centre-backs in Ligue 1's Team of the Season.\n\nAside from his innate ability, it's the progress Yoro has made over the past couple of years that has encouraged Man Utd to sign him.\n\nThe individual plaudits he won last season are a clear indication that he's already performing at a high level, and United are confident the teenager has the desire and attitude, plus capacity to learn, adapt and improve, to become an even more accomplished defender in the years ahead.\n\nAs Man Utd sporting director Dan Ashworth put it when the club completed the signing: \"Leny possesses every attribute needed to develop into a top-class centre-back. Having had such an excellent start to his career, we are excited to support him in reaching his immense potential here at Manchester United.\n\n\"This club has a fantastic record of developing young players, whether homegrown or brought in from elsewhere, and giving them the required guidance, time and patience to grow and flourish.\"\n\nPatience may be the key word. For all the amazing strides Yoro has made, a player's trajectory is rarely linear. There will be ups and downs as he adjusts to his new surroundings, life in a new country and the increased scrutiny that comes from turning out in the colours of one of the world's greatest clubs.\n\nLille fans will be disappointed they didn't get to see their star graduate playing for them for a little longer. Yet the path Yoro has taken is one they recognise.\n\nA long and impressive list of players have thrilled Lille followers before moving to the Premier League. Recent examples include Gabriel (to Arsenal), Carlos Baleba (Brighton & Hove Albion), Amadou Onana (Everton), Sven Botman (Newcastle United) and Nicolas Pepe (Arsenal).\n\nUnited followers will be encouraged that Gabriel and Botman appear on the roll-call. The pair's presence suggests that centre-backs that do well at Lille tend to shine in the Premier League.\n\nNow it's Yoro's turn. No one knows what the future holds, but the signs are good. He's a terrific prospect, and with the tremendous support he'll enjoy, there's every chance he'll succeed.", "source": {"uri": "premierleague.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premierleague.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoro_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Fonseca", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paulo Fonseca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Fofana_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Fofana (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Disasi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axel Disasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno\u00eet_Badiashile", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beno\u00eet Badiashile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eden Hazard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'\u00c9quipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L'\u00c9quipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-18_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national under-18 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_under-19_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national under-19 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabil_Bentaleb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nabil Bentaleb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Senior figures there made it clear over the past two weeks that Yoro would not be moving to Madrid, based on their offer,\" The Athletic explains.\n\n\"Yoro's preference for a move there counted for nothing to Lille, who were angered by suggestions their prized asset, who came through their academy, might choose to see out his contract and then leave free of charge.\"\n\nAccording to sources within Yoro's camp, \"there were concerns\" Lille would freeze the player out - not play him in the first team - and he would lose a year of development if he refused to take United's offer. This idea of there being a gun to his head when agreeing to join United might be a concern for the future should Real Madrid come knocking at his door further down the line.\n\n\"Going to the Bernabeu might have been Yoro's initial preference but, given the obvious impasse in valuations, it would not bring the same financial returns. The only offer received from Madrid had been flatly rejected.\"\n\nThe signing of Yoro \"will also be considered a feather in the cap of new chief executive Omar Berrada, who led final negotiations.\" It is said that the transfer \"had become an obsession\" with the club's new CEO keen to beat Madrid and \"signal a new direction for United.\"\n\nDan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox were also heavily involved in the deal and Wilcox flew out to meet Yoro early on in the deal to stress to the defender how much United wanted him and how they would ensure that he stayed on track to become one of the elite defenders of his generation.\n\nUnited legend Rio Ferdinand was also called into action to charm the youngster and this can be seen in the heart-warming video on the club's website of Yoro being shown a clip of the former United defender congratulating and advising the young player on his future progress.\n\nThe key role that United's new sporting team pulled off in the deal should surely breed confidence amongst fans of the club that finally there are highly competent people in positions of power.\n\nDespite the fact the club have had a very positive start to the window, there is still much work to be done in terms of outgoings and incomings, so there is plenty of time for Ineos to continue to flex their muscles this summer.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_browne@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Alex Browne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoro_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yoro Department"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/leny-yoro-2fbl-fra-ligue1-lille-toulouse-1-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747348", "eventUri": "eng-9747348", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Brazil midfielder Casemiro cost \u00a360million from Real Madrid but struggled in his second season at Old Trafford, while Cristiano Ronaldo returned on hefty wages in 2021 but left by mutual agreement after less than 18 months.\n\nIt has been a different story this summer. Joshua Zirkzee became the first player signed during the Ratcliffe era, and the 23-year-old has been joined by 18-year-old centre-back Leny Yoro.\n\nUnited have also got some older players off their books, with Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial both departing. However, it's the younger profile of transfer target which shows Ratcliffe's plan has - at least for now - been put in place.\n\n\"In a way also, I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune trying to buy success. It's not that clever is it buying Mbappe, anyone can figure that one out,\" Ratcliffe told The Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast in March.\n\n\"What's much more challenging is to find the next Mbappe or the next [Jude] Bellingham or the next Roy Keane. The Class of 92 and Ronaldo was only 16 or 17 when he came. The solution is not to spend a lot of money on a couple of great players.\n\n\"They've done that if you look at the last 10 years. The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes in the organising of the club. Then make can get recruitment right. It's such a vital part of a football club today, getting recruitment right.\"\n\nHave you been impressed with Manchester United's transfer business? Let us know in the comments section\n\nThe arrival of teenage defender Yoro was confirmed by United on Thursday evening. Hailing the signing, United's new sporting director Dan Ashworth pointed to the potential of a player who made his professional debut at 16 and was a regular for Lille last term.\n\n\"Leny is one of the most exciting young defenders in world football; he possesses every attribute needed to develop into a top-class centre-back,\" Ashworth said. \"Having had such an excellent start to his career, we are excited to support him in reaching his immense potential here at Manchester United.\n\n\"This club has a fantastic record of developing young players, whether homegrown or brought in from elsewhere, and giving them the required guidance, time and patience to grow and flourish. Under Erik ten Hag and our excellent staff we will ensure that Leny has the perfect platform to achieve the success that everyone across the club is aiming for.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Following the Netherlands' Euro 2024 semi-final defeat to England earlier this month, the defender gave a cryptic update on his future plans.\n\nImmediately after the game, Van Dijk admitted he has \"no idea\" about what the future may hold at both club and international level, telling Dutch outlet VI: \"I will think carefully this summer about what I want at club level and as an international. Then we will go for it again, but first recover from this.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool already has its own Leny Yoro that can explain $68m transfer call\n\nREAD MORE: Man Utd could hand Liverpool another transfer blow after Leny Yoro deal and agent's admission\n\nIt's no secret that Liverpool are in the market for a new defender following Joel Matip's departure at the end of last season, but Van Dijk will undoubtedly remain first-choice center-back no matter who comes in. Not only because he is club captain, but also because he is Liverpool's best defender.\n\nBattling it out to be his center-back partner is Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez, along with last season's breakthrough star Jarell Quansah. The trio are three strong options for Arne Slot but that proved to be Liverpool's downfall in capturing Yoro this summer.\n\nThe 18-year-old fully established himself as one of the best prospects and young center-backs in the world with his performances for Lille and was thought to be heading to Real Madrid. Yet despite interest from the Spanish giants as well as the Reds, Yoro opted for Old Trafford instead.\n\nSpeaking to Man United club media following his \u00a352million move, the youngster hinted at how the offer of more guaranteed game-time was decisive in his final decision. He cited how it was \"the perfect place to reach my potential and achieve my ambitions\", suggesting he would be able to pick up where he left off at Lille.\n\nWhile the news was gutwrenching for Liverpool fans, it does potentially hint at the future of Van Dijk, and that he may well be staying put at Anfield - at least for the coming season. While Yoro may fancy his chances of starting ahead of Konate, Gomez and Quansah, it's clear he feels he'd have better luck at Old Trafford.\n\nNothing has been confirmed on Van Dijk's future yet, but more news can be expected in the coming weeks once he finally returns to pre-season training following his extended break after the Euros.

But in other ways, the former Ligue 1 prospect makes the move to the Premier League down a well-trodden road. Especially when we consider where Yoro learned his trade.\n\nIndeed, Yoro joins Man Utd with a notable seal of approval following his education and development as a future defensive star after coming through Lille's youth academy and joining the French side's first team. Few clubs across Europe's top flight can lay claim to moulding as many future stars of English football as Lille can. And, to the club's credit, they've made sure to profit from such hard work each and every time a player opts to depart the Stade Pierre-Mauroy for England. Following Yoro's move to Man Utd, the club's profits in the transfer window over the last 10 years hit a remarkable sum of \u20ac372m. Which is not only the highest figure in all of French football, but it is bested by just three clubs in all of European football. So how do Lille succeed in developing and then profiting from so many young stars?\n\nAlthough French football is famed for developing some of the best players in the world at a level of quantity and quality that few other nations can match, Lille actually stand out as a notable exception to the idea that each Ligue 1 club has a constant stream of young players from their academy ready to step up and become stars. For example, of the 15 most valuable transfer fees the club have received for their players, just five could lay claim to French citizenship. \"Lille's academy isn't the most striking, as most of the best products were born before 2000,\" notes Transfermarkt's Ligue 1 expert Ronan Caroff when asked about the lack of French players among Lille's biggest sales. \" Benjamin Pavard, Martin Terrier or Lucas Digne would be the main names that come to mind when thinking about Lille homegrown talents, even if now Yoro, Lucas Chevalier and Ayyoub Bouaddi are starting to turn this reputation around.\"\n\nIndeed, the real secret behind Lille's success in the transfer market lies in their ability to scout young players from elsewhere, develop them in Ligue 1, then sell them to richer clubs in England and Spain. Of the club's top 10 biggest sales, Yoro and former Chelsea star Eden Hazard stand alone as the only players to have come through the club's youth academy. Whereas players like Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 (signed for \u20ac18m, sold for \u20ac80m), Victor Osimhen (signed for \u20ac22.4m, sold for \u20ac77.5m) and Rafael Le\u00e3o (signed for \u20ac20.2m, sold for 49.5m) were all scouted from neighbouring countries and developed in France before moving on elsewhere. In total Lille's 10 most valuable sales cost the club just \u20ac93.2m in transfer fees, but earned the club \u20ac451m in sales. \"The scouting has the most to do with the record sales,\" adds Caroff. \"Especially between 2017 and 2020, when the great mind of Luis Campos was at work to find gems, eventually putting the groundwork in for Lille's 20/21 Ligue 1 title. The staff has changed since, but the club still has a reputation for being a transfer window specialist. Typically, the players they buy join for fees rarely more than \u20ac20m and they are typically aged 23 or younger. Which offers room for better resale of these players once they prove themselves in Lille.\"\n\nHowever, Lille's interest in scouting, developing and then selling players only works if the Ligue 1 side have viable buyers at the end of the process to pay the fees necessary to keep the cycle going. And while Lille have sold players to all corners of the European continent, there's little doubt that English football takes a notable interest in any Lille player that begins to earn praise from the French press. No less than seven of the club's top 10 biggest sales ever were to English clubs and, rather remarkably, 49% of the \u20ac747m the club have earned in transfer fees over the last 10 seasons have come from English cheque books. While Arsenal fans may not have forgiven Lille for selling them P\u00e9p\u00e9 just yet, players like Hazard, Sven Botman, Amadou Onana, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, Yves Bissouma and Lucas Digne certainly underline why Lille are one of the Premier League's favourite shop windows to peer into and why the French club are so good at making money in the transfer window.", "source": {"uri":

{"id": 243320764, "title": "How White Sox' development plan is working for Jonathan Cannon", "text": "When White Sox starter Jonathan Cannon was told he was getting sent to the minors, he had a dour attitude. \u201cIt stinks in the moment,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cYou come up here to get experience, and then you get sent down.\u201d After he let the disappointment dissipate, he got to work. The Sox\u2019 2024 season is about seeing what they have in their young players, what they need to work on, and how they can help their prospects elevate their game. But the Sox have shown they\u2019re not afraid to send a prospect back to the minors if they\u2019re not performing. The team has sent Cannon and right-hander Nick Nastrini back to the minors after stints at the major-league level. Manager Pedro Grifol said it\u2019s good for guys to get that exposure and learn what they can or can\u2019t get away with in the majors. For Cannon, he worked on a cutter and changeup to get left-handed hitters out. \u201c[Sox pitching coach Ethan] Katz has been great,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWe sat down before I went back down and lined out what I needed to work on. Then, with [Triple-A Charlotte Pitching coach R.C. Lichtenstein] down in Charlotte, they\u2019ve all been very influential this year.\u201d Since being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte, Cannon has a 3.24 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP. Inadequate player development hurt the Sox in their last rebuild. The organization failed to get the most out of its players and couldn\u2019t replenish its farm system once those prospects graduated. General manager Chris Getz has proven he\u2019s not afraid to make a move that he might not see results from until years later after trading former ace Dylan Cease for a prospect haul \u2014 starter Drew Thorpe, outfielder Samuel Zavala, pitcher Jairo Iriarte and pitcher Steven Wilson. Acquiring young assets is the most important first step for an organization in a rebuild, but the difficult part is turning those prospects into major leaguers. One way to help the young players is to surround them with veterans. The one bright spot for the Sox this season has been their starting pitching, which had a 3.79 ERA in June, the sixth-best mark in the majors during that span, entering Friday\u2019s game against the Rockies. Cannon said it\u2019s been helpful to pick the brains of the other starters and that he talks to starters Garrett Crochet and Erick Fedde often. \u201cOn the bench between games, we pitch and then we sit and watch four games,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWe get a lot of downtime to talk. Guys like [starter Chris Flexen] have faced some of these lineups multiple times, so it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, last time you faced him, what worked, what didn\u2019t?\u2019 \u201cBeing able to talk to them about what their approach would be is very helpful, rather than going out there blind.\u201d As the Sox build the team back up and look for players who can remain with the team long-term, it\u2019s imperative to continue investing in player development. The Sox have one of the worst records in baseball, but their rotation has a ton of veterans who have been around the game for multiple seasons and operate with a sense of professionalism. \u201cBeing consistent at this level is a difficult thing to do,\u201d reliever Michael Kopech said. \u201cHaving a young pitching core like this, they can really develop some consistency as far as the environment here. \u201cThe game is going to be the game, so it\u2019ll take care of itself, but I think they have a chance to do something special.\u201d", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2024/06/29/how-white-sox-development-plan-is-working-for-jonathan-cannon", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c7e8a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7334x4187+0+352/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F27%2Ffd%2Ffd31f3914213941ae54c0d91de61%2Fjc-1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:47:42", "author": "Kyle Williams", "authors": ["Kyle Williams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.034}

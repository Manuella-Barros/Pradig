And Vanessa Ataides is no different \u2013 as she's on a mission to grow the \"world's biggest natural bum\" without going under the knife. Instead, she wants to grow her glutes in the gym. The 38-year-old, from Brazil, is certainly making good progress. But unfortunately, not all of the feedback she receives is positive. Not only do strangers gawp at her on the street, keyboard warriors also body shame her on social media. Vanessa won't hide away though \u2013 and defiantly continues to flex her muscles in public. She's even been posing in a bikini and sharing pictures of her impressive body on Instagram. In a recent post, Vanessa posed by the pool in her home city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She captioned the image: \"Stop letting others stop you from living! Create situations to make it happen.\" The body confident post amassed more than 2,300 likes \u2013 and many agreed with her motivational quote. One commenter said: \"Cutest thing ever\". Another wrote: \"Girl power.\" A third remarked: \"Beautiful and very hot.\" And a fourth added: \"Stay motivated! Great mood and mindset.\" By the looks of things, Vanessa is likely to keep getting up at 4am to exercise. She also makes sure to guzzle six protein-filled meals a day. Taking in enough calories is necessary if she wants to keep her muscles and curves in check \u2013 and it gives her energy to go all out in the gym too. Previously, Vanessa told local media: \"I know it's an addiction. When I reach a goal, I don't stop, I want more. Today I want to have the biggest bum in Brazil, but I know that when I achieve it, I'll want to have the biggest in the world.\"", "summary": "Vanessa Ataides gets up at the crack of dawn to workout in the gym \u2013 all in a bid to naturally increase the size of her behind.

I can sense the mood of the people to give our party an opportunity again to serve them.\"\n\nWearing the popular 'Mysore Peta' (headgear) and sporting a saffron shawl, Shah said the party would strive to win about 150 seats in the 225-member assembly to form the next government.\n\n\"It will be a BJP government this time to free the people from the corrupt and incompetent Congress government in the state. We will make Karnataka also a Congress-free state, as we did in other states,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP formed its first government in the southern state after winning a simple majority in the 2008 assembly election and was in power for five years with three Chief Ministers, but lost to the ruling Congress in the 2013 poll.\n\nUnion Ministers D.V.

For now focus on strengthening the party at all levels. You also need to take on the state government more strongly when it comes to issues such as corruption,\" Shah also said.\n\nShah sought to know how many rallies were organised to point out the failures of the Congress government. One leader who was part of the meeting said, \" Shah was clear in his approach. He was unhappy over several issues and felt that the state unit of the party had not done enough to take on the Congress government. There were so many issues about the Congress government reported, but the response from the BJP was either low-key or muted.\"\n\nGo for the kill and avoid marathon speeches and programmes aimed only at photoshoots, Shah advised.

A section of leaders from the Eshwarappa camp, which is upset with Yeddyurappa's \"arbitrary\" style of functioning, is said to be planning to raise the issue when they meet Shah in Bengaluru.\n\nThe 'loyal' party leaders fear that the factional feud may impact the party's electoral prospects if differences are not ironed out soon. Even Vistaaraks have reported that factional feud has to end and \"the frontline leaders have to behave themselves\" in the run-up to the elections. A large section of people, with whom Vistaaraks interacted recently, has expressed its anguish over the recent developments in the state unit of the BJP. It is high time the party deals with infighting sternly, the leaders added, hoping that Shah will send out a strong message in this regard.\n\nAbout 30,000 Vistaaraks interacted with the party workers and citizens at booth level in the state for 15 days recently and elicited their views on the party affairs. District-wise reports of the information gathered by Vistaaraks will be presented to Shah during his visit. Besides, he is also scheduled to directly interact with Vistaaraks, BJP sources said.\n\nThe sources said the party has already decided to clip the wings of the state leaders as part of the measures initiated to end infighting. The state leaders have been recently informed that they will not have much say in the ticket distribution for contesting the elections. The central leadership will finalise the candidates based on internal surveys and feedback from Vistaaraks. The BJP had recently sent an eight-member team from Delhi to the state to assess the mood among the workers.\n\nBesides, it has been conveyed to leaders of both the factions that loyalty to the party, winnability and one's background will be the basis for candidate selection and not loyalty to any individual leader.\n\nChanges in party\n\nThis apart, the sources said, Shah is likely to unveil a strategy to prepare the party for the polls. Specific responsibilities will be assigned to leaders in this regard. The BJP is likely to effect certain changes in the party organisation, keeping the elections in mind, the sources added.", "time": "21:01:00"}

In my three days here we will discuss preparations for the Assembly elections. Besides strengthening the party organisation from the booth level onwards, we will have to chalk out a plan for the coming poll,\" Mr. Shah said, urging the party workers to fight unitedly to bring the BJP to power in the state.\n\nDespite the dissidence simmering in the party, BJP leaders put up a show of unity before Mr Amit Shah both at the Kempegowda International Airport and the party office with senior leaders like Ananthkumar, K.S.

The reiteration is a message for those within the party more than for outsiders. With that one phrase, Shah has demanded that all dissent within the party be buried.\n\nIf there were any doubts left about who BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate would be in the 2018 Karnataka assembly elections, Amit Shah has just decimated it. The message is loud and clear 'decision is ours, work is yours'. In a series of meeting held on Saturday and Sunday, all that Amit Shah has asked the cadres to do is not stop working.\n\n\"There was no need for Amit Shah to keep repeating that Yeddyurappa is the BJP's chief ministerial candidate. He did for a reason. The intent was to drive home the point that decision on that front has already been made and neither leaders from the party nor from the ideological headquarters have a say anymore,\" said a source from the party.\n\nLeaders and party workers from the district and ward levels have been asked to set their differences aside and work for the organisation. The rift in the senior leadership of the state had trickled down to the grassroots level. In every ward and district, especially in the Shimoga region, cadres were divided into groups. Amit Shah's reiteration of who B S Yeddyurappa is is aimed at demolishing the division.\n\n\"The rift between two tall leaders of the state unit is no secret but you did see K S Eshwarappa telling the workers that the aim is to make B S Yeddyurappa the Chief Minister. He understands what the central leadership wants. Now is not the time for division and he is a senior leader who understands that organisation comes first,\" said another BJP leader.\n\nSome within the party, however, continued to believe that B S Yeddyurappa may be the CM face but things may turn out differently after the election results. \"Yes, he is the CM face but is there a chance for change in decisions? One can be too sure only after the BJP wins the elections,\" said a leader who is part of neither groups within the BJP. For now, Shah has put things into perspective. While he lashed out at the state leaders for failing to demand D K Shivakumar's resignation post the IT raids, he also encouraged them to be battle-ready. The BJP is readying itself to face elections as early as November or December this year.", "time": "08:43:00"}

In each of these issues, BJP is seen to be caught on the back foot.\n\nShah's other big challenge is the lack of unity in the party's state unit. He is expected to send out a strong message to warring factions to unite under the leadership of B S Yeddyurappa, the party's chief ministerial candidate.\n\nShah has his schedule all set, with 25 meetings packed in. Apart from Mission 150, which is the party's objective in the 2018 Assembly polls, Shah has already set sights on the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He has asked party men to rest 25 of the 28 seats in the parliamentary polls.", "time": "04:39:00"}

His visit to the mutt at Nagamangala taluk in neighbouring Mandya district, with a significant influence over Vokkaligas, is seen as an attempt to woo the community. Vokkaligas are the second largest community in Karnataka after Lingayats; they are significantly present in the old Mysuru or southern Karnataka region. Shah met the present pontiff of the mutt Nirmalanandanatha Swami and offered prayers at the temple. He later released a biography on Balaganagadharanatha Swamiji, the previous pontiff, titled 'Story of a Guru'. Lauding the works by the mutt and its pontiffs for the welfare of society, Shah made a special reference about Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru, who is highly regarded by Vokkaligas as he belonged to the community.\n\n\"Having come here, I will fail in my duty if I don't remember Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda, who was the follower of Adichunchanagiri Mutt,\" he said. Shah also appreciated the efforts put in by mutts and religious institutions in India towards ensuring a welfare society. \"In many countries in the world it is entirely the government's duty to ensure the welfare of society. There are welfare states in many countries, but it is only in India where attempts are being made to create a welfare society because of the efforts being put in by mutts and religious institutions along with the government... sometimes they are even ahead of the government,\" he added.\n\nSounding the poll bugle in Karnataka, Shah had yesterday kicked off his visit to the state, declaring that the party stands united and said, 'Ab Ki Baar, BJP Sarkar' (This time, a BJP government). Earlier today, he chaired a meeting of the political affairs committee of the Karnataka BJP at the party headquarters here, which was attended by state BJP President B S Yeddyurappa, Union ministers Ananth Kumar, Sadananda Gowda and other state leaders. Sources said that during the meeting, Shah asked party leaders to work together unitedly towards ensuring victory in the coming assembly polls.\n\nShah's comment to the faction-riven state unit comes after Yeddyurappa came under criticism from a section of party workers over his alleged \"arbitrary style\" of functioning with another senior leader K S Eshwarappa openly flagging the issue until both were told to shun open display of differences.

And our CM Siddaramaiah has also stepped up the pace of our campaign, so we are currently on a high,\" the office-bearer told ET.\n\nThe BJP mood is a bit low, though the party leaders expect Shah's three-day visit to change that. \"There has been a lot of infighting and bitterness within our state unit, though all the leaders have publicly said that they are united.\n\nThere is resentment over various issues and though our vistarak programme has been a success in terms of spreading our message, the feedback is that the public is unhappy with the infighting,\" a BJP leader admitted.\n\nShah is holding a whole series of meetings including one with intellectuals and public figures from various walks of life on how to improve the party's prospects. He will also meet the top Vokkaliga pontiff of the Adichunchunagiri mutt, who has enormous clout in South Karnataka and Sri Sri Ravishankar of the Art of Living, besides hold talks with OBC and SC/ST leaders and partyworkers from the 11Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka that the BJP lost in 2014.", "time": "20:22:00"}

The state BJP has now said that Kannada is priority in Karnataka and there would be no compromise.\n\nThe Congress in Karnataka had put the BJP on the backfoot with its open pro-Kannada and anti-Hindi imposition moves. Caught between the BJP senior leadership's Hindi push and Karnataka's anti-Hindi imposition sentiment, the state BJP could not, so far, take a crystal clear stand on the issue. On the day Amit Shah visited the state, however, the scenario seems to have changed.\n\n\"Kannada is priority in Karnataka and there is no two ways about it. Our stand is clear, Kannada is not just a language for us, it is our faith. But we do not want to politicise Kannada. It is our language and not a political agenda. The local language of every state is most important,\" said BJP leader Suresh Kumar. The BJP office was jubiliant as it welcomed its National President Amit Shah on Saturday.\n\nIn a series of meetings held at the state headquarters, Amit Shah is said to have given clarity on what the party's stand should be on various issues that the Congress has been cashing on. Post the interaction with Shah, leaders of the state BJP now are all set to take on their political rivals with more clarity and vigour. Following a series of meetings with office bearers, MLAs and MPs from the state Shah in scheduled to interact with people from various fields including business, religion, medicine and art on Saturday.\n\nMany of those invited for the Saturday evening meeting are expected to help BJP pave the way to prepare for election. Those invited also include Kannada actor and director Upendra who nurtures political ambitions but has refrained from openly supporting any political party.\n\nSpeaking on the Lingayat religious status row, BJP leaders said that they were confident of the community finding a solution from within. Lingayats are a huge voter base for the BJP considering its Chief Ministerial candidate B S Yeddyurappa belongs to the community. The BJP has managed to build a massive support base in North Karnataka thanks to the Lingayat voter base. While the BJP in the state had been mum over the demand for separate religious status to Lingayats, its leaders on Saturday said that there was no intention to intervene since it was important to keep the issue apolitical.", "time": "10:16:00"}

The event that was scheduled to be an interactive session ended up being an address by Shah.\n\n\"I have never seen a government more corrupt that Siddaramaiah's. His ministers are raided but neither is the minister questioned nor is his resignation sought. Perhaps the government is scared of being exposed. Siddaramaiah is like a transformer who has gone kaput. He refuses to allow the electricity of development from the centre to reach Karnataka. When something stops working, you need to pluck it out. Throw out Siddaramaiah,\" Amit Shah urged the gathering.\n\nFormer Governor of Jharkhand and Bihar Rama Jois, renowned cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, senior RSS members, advocates, Chartered accountants, bankers, urban scientists and conservationists etc were invited to be part of the intellectual's meet on Saturday. Many were left disappointed that no interaction took place in a meeting that was called for the very purpose.\n\n\"Leadership in BJP not based on birth or family\"\n\nTaking potshots at the Congress, Shah claimed that the BJP was the only truly democratic party in the country. \"Leaders in my party are not born into families. They rise from the grassroots level. None can guess who will be the next BJP National President but does anyone have a doubt over who the next President of Congress will be after Sonia Gandhi,\" he mocked the Nehru-Gandhi family.\n\nIn his attempt to push BJP as a democratic entity Shah said that parties are to be evaluated on internal democracy, ideology and performance when in power. He went on to state that the BJP topped in all three criterion. \"BJP has been able to give the country good Prime Ministers and Chief Minister because of this internal democracy,\" Shah said.\n\n\"Congress was merely a special purpose vehicle\"\n\nDeeming the Congress an entity that came to be without a singular ideological identity, Amit Shah called it a 'special purpose vehicle'. The Congress was merely a group formed by people who wanted freedom. People of all ideologies, beliefs joined the Congress to fight for freedom. Its foundation has no ideology but only had intent. It was a special purpose vehicle with people of all ideologies onboard,\" he said mockingly.\n\nHe compared that to the formation of Jan Sangh, the mother party that later became the BJP. Shah said that the Jan Sangh was formed on the basis of ideology. An ideology to provide alternates to the ones being offered by the Nehru government to help the people of India better.\n\nDrawing comparisons between every state's economic performance, financial status, socio-cultural reforms under the Congress and the BJP government, Shah declared that states under BJP fared better. Be it in terms of economy, reforms or welfare schemes, Shah said that the BJP government had always ensured that states under its rule were put on the fast track for development.\n\nQuestioning the Siddaramaiah government on central funds, Shah asked where all the money was going. \"You may not ask them, but I will.

Yeddyurappa here on Saturday making it clear that he would stand for no dissidence from rival claimants even in the face of some unhappiness in the ranks over the role of BSY's coterie.\n\nArriving at the airport to a near euphoric welcome, he addressed party workers at the BJP office in Malleswaram.\n\nMr. Shah, who is here on a three day visit to bolster party unity and build it up from the booth level, said the party hoped to gain a foothold in south India by coming to power in Karnataka in the coming assembly polls and told party workers not to rest until they had removed the 'corrupt' Congress government in the state.\n\n\"My focus in Karnataka is not only on strengthening the party base, but also on removing the corrupt Congress government and installing a BJP government in its place in 2018,\" he said, noting that since winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won one election after another in the country.\n\n\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity has helped the party win many elections. In my three days here we will discuss preparations for the Assembly elections. Besides strengthening the party organisation from the booth level onwards, we will have to chalk out a plan for the coming poll,\" Mr. Shah said, urging the party workers to fight unitedly to bring the BJP to power in the state.\n\nAlso, observing that the country had never seen such unemployment before as today, he said, \"Mr Modi had promised to generate two crore jobs, but has been able to create only one lakh jobs during the last three years. On the contrary the Siddramaiah government has provided 30,000 jobs in the government sector. While the Congress party wants to help the last man in a queue, the BJP government wants to benefit those at the top. This is the difference between the Modi government and a Congress government.\"\n\nReferring to the \"Make in India\" programme announced by Mr Modi, Mr Gandhi noted that not even one new industry had been opened by his government.\n\nOn the other hand, lauding the performance of the Siddaramaiah government, he asserted that it would come back to power in the state in the 2018 elections as it had delivered on all its promises. In his address, CM Siddaramaiah exuded confidence that his government would return to power for a second term.\n\n\"BJP leaders are hoping to come back to power by fomenting communal trouble in the state. But (Amit) Shah's tricks won't work in Karnataka, which is a land of Basavanna, Kanakadasa and Kuvempu. Nobody can stop me from retaining power in 2018 and Rahul Gandhi from becoming PM in 2019,\" he thundered. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, KPCC president Dr G. Parameshwar and former Union Minister Muniyappa spoke.\n\nDKS: I am a disciplined Congress soldier\n\nEnergy Minister D K Shivakumar, who is smarting under the recent Income Tax raids on his properties , described himself as a \"disciplined solider\" of the party on Saturday and reassured Congress leaders that he had not done anything to cause them any hurt or pain.\n\nAddressing the rally to felicitate AICC vice president Rahul Gandhi, he referred to the the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat saying it had turned into \"a big fight,\" but eventually truth had won (Satyameva Jayate). \"This victory has given a big boost to the Congress workers,\" he added.\n\nClaiming that efforts were being made to divide the Congress, he urged party workers not to be disturbed by such attempts, but remain courageous as only the party could protect the country. Mr Shivakumar was put in charge of keeping the Congress flock together before the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat and was raided even as he was busy keeping the MLAs \"safe\" at a resort near Bengaluru. Meanwhile, working president of KPCC S.R. Patil asserted that no force could destroy the Congress. \"The Congress has a history of successfully fighting the British. When it could take on the mighty British empire, why not the opposition parties in the country?\" he asked.", "time": "05:21:00"}

Shah arrived in Bengaluru on Saturday morning to begin his three-day tour of the state.\n\nShah targetted Siddaramaiah, saying the Congress government should be \"thrown out for eating up all of the Centre's grants\". He likened the Centre to a power plant that supplies electricity to all states. \"The state government here is like a burnt transformer. That's why people here get nothing. Still, Siddaramaiah complains that the Centre is not giving enough funds,\" Shah charged, urging people to make state party president B S Yeddyurappa the next chief minister.\n\nThe previous UPA government had earmarked Rs 61,691 crore for Karnataka under the 13th Finance Commission, he said. \"The Modi government has given Karnataka Rs 1.86 lakh crore under the 14th Finance Commission. Where's all this money going? Siddaramaiah has to answer this. Regardless of whether people ask for it, I will demand that he shows the accounts,\" he said.\n\nAmid speculation that the state party unit was beset with bickering, Shah said the BJP was the only party in India with its internal democracy in tact. \"Who'll replace Sonia Gandhi as the Congress president?

Someone asks or not, but I am going to come to Karnataka during the run-up to the Assembly election and ask for the accounts from Siddaramaiah,\" he said.\n\nUnder the Manmohan Singh rule, Karnataka had received Rs 61,691 crore from the central government, but under the 14th Finance Commission, the Centre gave Rs 1,86,975 crore to the state, Shah said.\n\n\"The money has increased three folds under Narendra Modiji's government,\" he said.\n\nAttacking the Congress, he said the BJP was among the few parties which has protected internal democracy within the party, unlike the Congress which runs on dynastic principles.\n\n\"Can anybody predict the next national president of the party (BJP). But one can predict with precision who could be the president of Congress after Soniaji decides to retire.\n\nEverybody knows it will be Rahul Gandhi. There is no confusion about it. There is no internal democracy there,\" he argued.\n\nThe BJP is the only party in which a boy who spent his life pasting posters (himself) and a tea seller (Modi) can climb up the ladders of the highest ranks, he said.\n\nShah also said that whenever, the BJP ruled the nation, the GDP grew rapidly, unlike in the Congress rule.\n\n\"When Atal Bihari Vajpayee took charge as the Prime Minister, India's GDP increased from 4.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent, and when Manmohan Singh left after ten years of rule, the GDP climbed down to 4.4 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"Now under the rule of Modi, who is the son of a tea seller, the GDP has increased to 7.2 per cent from 4.4 per cent,\" he added.", "time": "18:43:00"}

The compensation will dip further with the new rules for drought relief,\" he pointed out. He also challenged the centre, which claimed be \"pro-farmer\", to waive farm loans from nationalised banks. The state has already waived loans from cooperative banks, he pointed out.\n\nMr. Rao also claimed that by imposing Hindi and amending rules of recruitment for nationalised banks, the NDA government was affecting the federal structure. \"Over 8,000 Kannadigas are being denied jobs in banks because of the new recruitment rules framed by Institute of Banking and Personnel Selection,\" he observed.\n\nAccusing BJP of poaching Congress leaders, he sought to know why former Union Ministers S.M.

{"id": 243340040, "title": "Detroit Tigers stung by late 3-run homer in 5-2 loss to Los Angeles Angels", "text": "Detroit Tigers right-hander Kenta Maeda left the game with one out in the sixth inning. A line-drive comebacker from Taylor Ward, clocked at a 94.4 mph exit velocity, deflected off his glove hand and his stomach. The ball ricocheted toward first base, and although Maeda hustled to cover first on the scary play, he didn't get there in time, resulting in an infield single. It was the final pitch of Maeda's 14th start. \"Kenta is fine,\" manager A.J. Hinch told reporters in Anaheim. \"I didn't take him out because of any injury. I was taking him out anyway for the next at-bat if the guy got on base. Luckily, it hit his hand and not a direct hit to the ribs or anything like that.\" The Tigers didn't lose Maeda to an injury, but they lost 5-2 to the Los Angeles Angels on Friday in the second of four games in the series at Angel Stadium. The Angels took the lead with Logan O'Hoppe's three-run home run off right-handed reliever Shelby Miller with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning. The Tigers (37-45) have lost 15 of their past 21 games, falling to eight games below .500. \"That was the ending of the game,\" Hinch said of O'Hoppe's home run. \"There were a lot of reasons for the game. It looked like a splitter that backed up and hung, and he didn't miss it. They made the biggest swing at the biggest moment. It hurt.\" STOCK WATCH: Jack Flaherty shines, but veteran trade chip scuffles as Tigers complete first half Once again, the Tigers struggled on offense. The Tigers finished with two hits and four walks off six different pitchers. The four walks, though, occurred in the third inning against right-hander Zach Plesac. Plesac recorded the first two outs before Ryan Kreidler's single jumpstarted a two-run inning. That's because Plesac walked the next four batters in a row: Wenceel P\u00e9rez, Riley Greene, Matt Vierling and Mark Canha. Vierling and Canha's walks came with the bases loaded, for a 2-2 tie. A MUD HEN: Tigers right-hander Matt Manning 'working on delivery' in Triple-A Toledo Other than that, the Tigers' offense was lifeless against the Angels. The only other hit came from Andy Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez against right-handed reliever Jos\u00e9 Marte to open the fourth inning, but the next three batters were sent down. After Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's single, the Angels \u2014 using a combination of five pitchers \u2014 retired 18 Tigers in a row to end the game. It marked another brutal performance on offense, as the Tigers have mustered just 10 hits over their past three games. \"We get in these stretches, and you got to try to find a solution rather than let it drag you down,\" Hinch said. \"It's not a lack of effort or trying, but it's results whenever you're in the competition, and we haven't been able to find the right spark, certainly recently.\" Canha, whom the Tigers acquired in an offseason trade from the Milwaukee Brewers, finished 0-for-3 with one walk out of the cleanup spot. The 35-year-old is hitting .207 with one home run, 18 walks and 41 strikeouts in his past 46 games, dating to May 1.

The Angels scored two runs against him in the first inning. It only took two batters for the Angels to score those runs, a result of Nolan Schanuel's leadoff single and Luis Rengifo's two-run home run. Rengifo smashed a middle-middle fastball for a 398-foot homer to center field. Maeda, a fly-ball pitcher for his entire career, has surrendered 12 homers in 59\u2153 innings this season, putting him at a career-high 1.8 homers per nine innings. SKUB: How Tarik Skubal tackled Phillies to help Tigers beat ERA leader Ranger Su\u00e1rez After that, Maeda settled in. He retired the next three batters to end the first as part of six batters sent down in a row before Luis Guillorme's leadoff single in the third inning, but a strikeout/caught stealing shut down Guillorme on the bases. Maeda worked around a single and a walk in the fourth inning, striking out Mickey Moniak with a splitter below the zone to strand two runners in scoring position. He also pitched a clean fifth inning and recorded the first out in the sixth inning before taking a line drive from Ward off his hip. In his 14th start, Maeda allowed two runs on six hits and one walk with four strikeouts across 5\u2153 innings, throwing 87 pitches. He lowered his ERA to 5.76.

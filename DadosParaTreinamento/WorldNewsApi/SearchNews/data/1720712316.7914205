Aontu\u2019s Luke Silke got the biggest share of the transfers from Tom Quirke but will struggle to make up enough ground. At this stage Cllr Joe Sheridan (FF) is on course to lose his seat with over 164 between him and Independent Karey McHugh Farag. Transfers from Luke Silke and Stiof\u00e1n De Lundres \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh of Sinn F\u00e9in are more likely to favour an Independent but anything can happen over the next few hours. Shaun Cunniffe for Independent Ireland and Cllr Donagh Killilea will have to wait for a few more counts to cross the line with just 13 surplus votes to be distributed \u2013 they currently stand at 1,701 and 1660 respectively.

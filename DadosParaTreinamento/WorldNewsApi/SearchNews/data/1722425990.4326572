The \u201cI Luv It\u201d pop star, 27, spoke to the Sunday Times recently to discuss the release of her latest studio album, C, XOXO, which features the \u201cFamily Matters\u201d rapper, 37, on not one but two tracks: \u201cHot Uptown\u201d and \u201cUuugly.\u201d While dishing on the new songs \u2014 which came together after Cabello slid into Drake\u2019s DMs \u2014 the singer was asked for her opinion on the war of words that\u2019s been happening between her collaborator and Lamar over the last few months. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating to see people talk about someone you know in a way that is negative,\u201d Cabello shared generally, not mentioning the rappers by name. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Dang, if only you guys could just have dinner or something.\u2019\u201d Cabello is the latest star to weigh in on Drake and Lamar\u2019s verbal sparing match, which began after the latter unloaded his pointed diss verse on Metro Boomin and Future\u2019s \u201cLike That\u201d hit in March. In the weeks that followed, the rap stars \u2014 plus others like J. Cole, Rick Ross and A$AP Rocky \u2014 exchanged diss records back and forth, as Drake officially kicked things off with his \u201cPush Ups\u201d track. He followed up with his controversial \u201cTaylor Made Freestyle,\u201d which featured AI vocals from the late Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, as a way to urge the West Coast rapper to respond. Lamar answered the call on April 30 when he surprise-dropped his diss song \u201cEuphoria.\u201d The song featured direct shots at Drake, calling him a \u201cmaster manipulator and a habitual liar\" and even criticizing his approach to fatherhood. In the days afterward, Lamar and Drake dropped multiple responses to each other, with the final round consisting of the latter\u2019s \u201cThe Heart Part 6\u201d \u2014 a nod to Lamar's staple \"The Heart\" series \u2014 and Lamar\u2019s scathing, chart-topping anthem \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d The Pulitzer Prize winner performed the song live for the first time (five times in a row) during his star-studded \"Ken & Friends\" concert on June 19. The show, which took place at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, marked the latest development in Lamar and Drake\u2019s beef. However, fans expect it may continue after Lamar drops his \u201cNot Like Us\u201d music video, which he was seen filming in his hometown of Compton on Saturday, June 22. The video does not yet have a release date.", "summary": "&#34;It&#39;s so frustrating to see people talk about someone you know in a way that is negative,&#34; the singer said of her &#34;Hot Uptown&#34; collaborator and Lamar feuding", "url": "https://people.com/camila-cabello-says-drake-kendrick-lamar-rap-beef-is-so-frustrating-8671279", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/q_QU9q83y-ujqrPfrQUGsS0aTp8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/camila-cabello-drake-kendrick-lamar-tout-062824-8d895d64443448d98a7821c01161ac63.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:00:26", "author": "Njera Perkins", "authors": ["Njera Perkins"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.109}

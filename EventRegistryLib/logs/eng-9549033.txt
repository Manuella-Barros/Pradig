However, according to the investigation, the athletes were cleared by the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA), which said that they had failed the tests due to a contaminated hotel kitchen. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted the explanation and allowed the athletes to compete, the media outlets claim.\n\nIn an interview with the news outlet Politico published on Monday, Tygart claimed that WADA is biased towards Chinese athletes and let China off the hook intentionally and \"swept [the case] under the carpet.\"\n\n\"Because of the cover-up that happened by China, and WADA allowing it, now that it's come to light it's going to be a train wreck waiting to happen going into Paris,\" he stated.\n\nThe official went on to accuse the entire International Olympic Committee (IOC) of favoring China due to its position as an \"incredibly important country to the Olympic Movement.\"\n\n\"The IOC has cozied up to China in a really big way.

And it's chosen [in] this case not to do so,\" he claimed.\n\nNeither CHINADA nor the IOC has commented on Tygart's accusations.

It informed, as it should do, the World Anti Doping Agency WADA and started to investigate the case:\n\nChina acknowledged the positive tests in a report by its antidoping regulator, saying that the swimmers had ingested the banned substance unwittingly and in tiny amounts, and that no action against them was warranted.\n\nBut an examination by The New York Times found that the previously unreported episode sharply divided the antidoping world, where China's record has long been a flashpoint. American officials and other experts said the swimmers should have been suspended or publicly identified pending further investigation, and they suggested that the failure to do so rested with Chinese sports officials; swimming's international governing body, World Aquatics; and the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global authority that oversees national drug-testing programs.\n\n...\n\nEven after other national and international antidoping officials repeatedly provided the global regulator, known as WADA, with intelligence suggesting a cover-up and doping by Chinese swimmers, the agency chose not to try to hold the athletes accountable, asserting \"a lack of any credible evidence\" to challenge China's version of events. WADA defended its decision not to take action, calling the criticism unsubstantiated.\n\nThe Chinese anti-doping agency as well as WADA handled the case by the book. There was a plausible explanation of a food contamination with tiny amounts of the drug during a swimming event in China. No other test before and after that event had been positive. The amount of drugs involved was too tiny to make a difference. WADA did not put out a public notice about the incident as no further action was required. No athletes were publicly named and shamed as none had been proven to be guilty.\n\nBut that did not fit the U.S. messaging agenda that was designed to defame China. Thus other headlines in the usual western propaganda media were following up:\n\nIn a long press conference (video) WADA went public to defend itself. It had done all what it was supposed to do in that case.\n\nWADA says it astonished by 'completely false, defamatory' remarks by USADA chief in case of Chinese swimmers - Global Times\n\nA fairly neutral report on the issue came out in support of WADA:\n\nChinese swimming scandal: a strong defence by world anti-doping body, but narrative of 'cover-up' remains - The Conservation\n\nTransparency is key to any organisation's reputation. It is never a good look when a body like WADA is forced to respond to a story exposed by the media, in this case a German documentary and a New York Times report.\n\nWADA has surely suffered reputational damage by not being open about the case when it unfolded three years ago. But it maintains it couldn't have handled the situation differently because of the complexity of the global anti-doping framework between WADA and national anti-doping agencies.\n\nIt wasn't up to WADA to make the details of the failed tests public - this responsibility rested with the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) because it had carried out the tests and investigated the positive results. To protect innocent athletes if no violation is found, no public announcement is required.\n\nGiven an investigation by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security found traces of the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ) in a kitchen at the swimmers' hotel, CHINADA ruled the positive tests were the result of accidental contamination. The Chinese swimmers were cleared without any public announcement.\n\n...\n\nFar from accepting CHINADA's findings on the face of it, WADA requested the entire case file so it could conduct its own scientific and legal investigations - including speaking with the drug manufacturer to get the latest unpublished science on TMZ, and comparing the Chinese positive tests with TMZ cases in other countries, including the US. WADA ultimately determined there was no concrete evidence to \"disprove\" the possibility of environmental contamination.\n\nThe damage though, due to the sensational U.S. information operation, has been done:\n\nSo, has WADA succeeded in changing the narrative? Probably not.\n\nWhy? Because putting the words \"China\" and \"doping\" together is a lightning rod in the current political climate given the intense rivalry between China and the US.\n\nCurrently there are 23 people serving anti-doping suspensions in Australia. Do we feel personal or national shame for their wrongdoing?\n\nEvery time the US team marches into an Olympic Games, or steps up onto a World Championships medal podium, do we point at them while recalling memories of the US Postal Service cycling team and the banned-for-life cyclist Lance Armstrong?\n\nBut when it comes to China, many observers are quick to name and shame athletes, viewing every news story as some kind of proof the country must have a systemic, state-sanctioned doping program.\n\nAnd that dear friends was the sole purpose of this nonsense.\n\nAs the next summer Olympics will soon begin we can expect to see more of such stuff.", "source": {"uri": "lewrockwell.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lew Rockwell"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For example the NY Times reports that US team swimmer Paige Madden thinks medals from the Tokyo Olympics should be reallocated. \"I feel that Team USA was cheated.\" British swimmer James Guy says, \"Ban them all and never compete again.\" What might be considered whining and poor sportsmanship is effectively being encouraged by western media.\n\nThe NYTimes and ARD are the same two media that precipitated the accusations of \"state sponsored doping\" in Russia. It did enormous damage to thousands of Russian athletes and resulted in different levels of banning starting with the Rio Olympics in 2016. Although widely accepted as \"truth\" in the West, the claims of widespread Russian doping were weak when evidence was required. Most Russian athletes who challenged their banning were exonerated. The major accusers, the Stepanovs and Grigory Rodchenkov, were themselves guilty of doping and profiting from doping. Despite this, the banning has continued and escalated after the Russian intervention in Ukraine. The accusations and banning were useful in propelling the \"new cold war\" and \"new McCarthyism\".\n\nNYT and ARD, and their anonymous informants, may be seeking to do something similar to China. USADA has issued a response in which they say China may be engaging in \"systematic doping\" under a \"coordinated doping regime\". On May 6 USADA's Tygart escalated his attacks. He implies the Paris Olympics will be a \"train wreck\" because of WADA complicity in China's \"cheating\". He hopes the US government will \"step in and help lead and fix this.\" Surely a recipe for success.\n\nOn Jan. 1-3 in 2021, the Chinese swim team was having a domestic swim meet. It was in the midst of covid lockdown. As usual, the team was drug tested but this time a strange thing happened: many swimmers tested positive for a trace amount of the banned medication trimetazadine (TMZ).\n\nThe China Anti Doping Agency (CHINADA) investigated and reported the facts to the World Anti Doping Agency as required. They found:\n\nCHINADA concluded the positive TMZ tests were from hotel food and the athletes were not at fault.\n\nThey reported the incident and investigation to the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and the international swimming federation now known as World Aquatics (formerly FINA). Both organizations examined the facts and agreed with the findings.\n\nBecause the athletes were deemed to have no fault, the incident and names of the athletes were not publicized. WADA regulations indicate that there should be no publicity or naming of athletes deemed innocent and without an \"Anti Doping Rule Violation\" (ADRV).\n\nApproximately a year later, in 2022, anonymous sources reported this incident to the NY Times and ARD. Since then, the two media outlets have done further investigation but kept the story secret until two weeks ago.\n\nThey suggest something shady happened back in early 2021. They suggest WADA may be complicit in covering up anti doping violations. They almost encourage western athletes to challenge the Chinese swimming accomplishments and be \"angry\". On April 20 the story was \"Top Chinese Swimmers Tested Positive for Banned Drug, Then Won Olympic Gold\". On April 21 the story was \"'Team USA Was Cheated': Chinese Doping Case Exposes Rift in Swimming\". On April 22 the story was \"Top Biden Official Calls for Inquiry Into Chinese Doping Case.\"\n\nThese reports ignited a flood of other sensational and accusatory reports and editorials. The Guardian report is titled \"Poison in the pool: why the latest Chinese doping row is proving so toxic\". Sports Yahoo says \"Extremely concerned Olympians will not let the Chinese doping allegations die\". The PBS News Hour had a video report titled \"Chinese doping 'swept under the carpet': US anti-doping chief says\". Sports Illustrated said the news may alter the distribution of medals from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the situation. .\n\nThe NY Times and ARD say they have been investigating this story for two years. The release appears timed to have maximum impact and possible damage, just months before the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe US Anti Doping Agency (USADA) is led by the hyper-aggressive Travis Tyler. He has used the reports to claim that WADA is complicit in a Chinese \"cover-up\". In a TV interview before a large national audience Tygart said,\n\n\"China didn't follow the rules. They effectively swept this under the carpet because they didn't find a violation. They didn't announce a violation. They didn't disqualify the athletes from the event at which they tested positive. And this is absolutely mandatory under the world anti-doping code that all nations are required to follow.\"\n\nWADA has responded that Tygart's comments seem \"politically motivated\". They say CHINADA followed the rules, investigated and reported as required. They say China did NOT have to announce it to the world, or name the individual athletes for the very good reason that false accusations of doping can destroy a career. WADA regulations say the names of athletes should NOT be publicized until or unless it is confirmed they have an Anti Doping Rule Violation.\n\nWADA is the international organization charged with supervising global anti-doping in sports. With its headquarters in Canada and most of its leaders from NATO countries, it is a largely western organization.\n\nThey are highly sensitive to criticism from the West. It has pushed back against some of the most extreme criticism, for example from the USADA head. They have also appointed an independent investigator to review what happened in China and whether WADA was correct to accept the Chinese investigation and report.\n\nWADA appointed Eric Cottier, the prosecutor general of a Swiss region. WADA headquarters are in Canada but the organization is registered in Switzerland. USADA has criticized the appointment suggesting that Cottier is not sufficiently \"independent\".\n\nThoms Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee, has voiced support for WADA.\n\nWADA has defended their actions in a press conference and fact sheet about the case.\n\nThe controversy may quiet down. But a lot of poison has been spread around. Encouraged by the NY Times and other media, numerous western athletes now claim they feel \"cheated\" out of medals at the Tokyo Olympics since 5 medals were won by Chinese swimmers involved in the TMZ \"doping scandal\".\n\nIt is also possible the controversy will continue. Will the \"Sports Czar\" of the Biden Administration get involved? Will the FBI be designated to investigate? These are now possible in the wake of the Rodchenkov Anti Doping Act which passed Congress in 2020.\n\nReader comments following articles indicate there is a wellspring of anti-China hostility encouraged by the accusations. The most popular comment on this article says, \"When will democracies learn that authoritarian regimes play dirty, and should be viewed as suspect not deserving of good faith.\" Another says,\"No one knows doping like China knows doping, China knows doping best.\" Another one says, \"China cheats. Russia cheats. Just like the East Germans did before them. Their governments will meet the same fate as they did.\"\n\nThere has been some pushback to the sensational anti-China accusations. For example Denis Cotterell is a world class coach who has trained both Australian and Chinese Olympic swimmers. He has spoken out strongly in support of the Chinese swimmers. He says, \"I can see what they (the swimmers) go through. I see the measures... The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time. They are so adamant on having clean sport.\"\n\nAn insightful article from an Australian academic sports authority and popular sports commentator suggests there are political forces at work: \"WADA - like the United Nations and other organizations - finds itself in the cross hairs of the great power struggle of our time: a rising China and its challenge to US dominance.\"\n\nAccording to the \"2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community\", China is \"challenging longstanding rules of the international system as well as U.S. primacy within it.\" China's positive \"international image\" is a challenge to U.S. leadership. By this logic, it is in the US interests to damage China's international reputation and standing.\n\nThis raises the question: How did the TMZ get into the hotel kitchen and into the food being served to these Chinese athletes?\n\nIn February 2022, accusations of intentional doping were heaped on the Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva. A trace amount of trimetazadine (TMZ) was detected in a drug test taken seven weeks before the Beijing Olympics. There are similarities to the Chinese case: same drug, same trace amount detected, same mystery as to how it was ingested.\n\nBecause she could not explain how it got there, Valieva was condemned in the West and ultimately had her international career destroyed. The Russian figure skating sweep was prevented and the Russian team lost their gold medals. The controversy distracted and partially ruined the Beijing Olympics. The \"intelligence community\" undoubtedly considers this a success.\n\nHow did the TMZ get in the hotel kitchen in China? Who are the \"whistle blowers\" who informed the New York Times and ARD and supplied the names of the athletes who tested positive for the trace amount of TMZ?\n\nThe anti doping crusade is being manipulated by powerful forces with ignoble intentions.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

The swimmers were allowed to compete in the Olympics after WADA accepted China's findings that suggested the Chinese swimmers unwittingly ingested the substance from food they ate at a hotel in Shijiazhuang, in the country's Hebei Province.\n\nChinese investigators did not say how the banned substance got into the hotel's kitchen. Two months after the swimmers tested positive, investigators reported finding trace amounts of the substance in spice containers, sink drains and extractor vents in the hotel's kitchen, an explanation that many anti-doping experts question.\n\nAccording to a 61-page report compiled by those investigators and reviewed by The New York Times, 60 tests were conducted on 39 swimmers, whose urine samples produced 28 positives involving 23 swimmers. All of the samples tested positive for the same drug -- TMZ.\n\nQuestions remain regarding how Chinese authorities handled the samples, which were supposed to be immediately sent to an accredited laboratory that would analyze findings and report them to WADA and World Aquatics, the sport's international governing body. The results were not reported to the tracking site until two months after the samples were taken.\n\nEven trace amounts of this banned substance are supposed to register as a failed drug test and prompt punishment. The chain of events that followed the testing differed significantly from what happened a year later when Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva tested positive for TMZ (and also blamed contaminated food). In that circumstance, WADA immediately challenged the Russian anti-doping agency's decision to clear her, and she was ultimately given a four-year ban.\n\nBut in the lead-up to Tokyo, there were no suspensions and no public disclosures. WADA didn't stop any of the swimmers who tested positive from competing in an Olympic qualifying event and ultimately the Olympic Games.\n\nThe day of the Times' report, WADA released a lengthy statement defending its decision to accept the conclusions made by the China Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) -- that the swimmers had tested positive in early 2021 for TMZ after inadvertently being exposed to the substance through contamination. The statement emphasized their review process and said that an on-the-ground inquiry was not possible due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\"WADA ultimately concluded that it was not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source of TMZ and it was compatible with the analytical data in the file,\" the statement said. \"WADA also concluded that, given the specific circumstances of the asserted contamination, the athletes would be held to have no fault or negligence. As such, and based on the advice of external counsel, WADA considered that an appeal was not warranted.\"\n\nWADA also said it was asked in 2022 by the International Testing Agency to review its sample collection and reporting process, and that an independent review \"concluded that proper procedures had been followed and that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.\"\n\nWADA also threatened to take legal action against those publishing \"misleading and potentially defamatory\" coverage of the events.\n\nThe same day, Travis Tygart, the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, went scorched earth.\n\n\"It is disappointing to see WADA stoop to threats and scare tactics when confronted with a blatant violation of the rules governing anti-doping,\" Tygart said in a statement. \"When you blow away their rhetoric, the facts remain as have been reported: WADA failed to provisionally suspend the athletes, disqualify results, and publicly disclose the positives. These are egregious failures, even if you buy their story that this was contamination and a potent drug 'magically appeared' in a kitchen and led to 23 positive tests of elite Chinese swimmers. ...\n\n\"Transparency is the key to shining the light in the darkness, and here, by not following the rules, WADA and CHINADA have left clean athletes in the dark.\"\n\nWADA then fired back by stating it was \"astonished by the outrageous, completely false and defamatory remarks\" from Tygart while reiterating its view that it acted appropriately in deciding not to appeal the case.\n\nIn response to the blowback, WADA on April 25 announced a new review of its process via an independent prosecutor, Eric Cottier. That also drew criticism from USADA, as WADA hand-picked the Swiss attorney to conduct the review. Last week, WADA defended Cottier's reputation and said he was \"entirely independent.\"\n\nAlso last week, WADA published a six-page fact sheet to defend its actions (and inaction) further. It mentioned that WADA does not have the authority to issue a provisional suspension, and it reiterated that WADA believed the Chinese investigators and the kitchen contamination scenario.\n\nWADA also stated that, \"based on the concentrations of TMZ detected in the athletes' samples, there would have been no performance benefit during the national competition on January (1-3,) 2021, let alone at subsequent events such as the Olympic Games in Tokyo some seven months later.\"\n\n\"WADA understands that some stakeholders may disagree with the outcome of this case,\" the fact sheet reads. \"However, to leap to conspiracy theories of cover-ups and favoritism towards China is outrageous, without basis and defamatory.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a growing chorus of organizations are criticizing the investigation. The World Players Association issued a statement last week calling for reforms in WADA's process, and the Team USA Athletes' Commission and USA Swimming'' Athletes' Advisory Council sent a letter to the White House asking for an independent investigation of the case.\n\nA number of high-profile swimmers who swam against the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for TMZ have shared their reactions to these revelations -- and their support for USADA. It's hard to imagine this storyline fading away anytime soon, considering that some of the same Chinese swimmers (including Zhang Yufei, who won gold in the 200-meter butterfly and as part of the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay) will be contending for medals again in Paris.\n\nFive-time U.S. Olympic medalist Lilly King posted on Instagram after the news broke, \"Complete heartbreak for our clean athletes and frustration in the system that has failed them.\"\n\nThe 2024 Games open July 26, and Cottier's report is due before then. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said recently he had \"full confidence\" in WADA and did not think the situation should affect Chinese swimmers' participation in Paris.\n\n\"If the procedures are followed, there is no reason for them not to be there,\" Bach told French news agency AFP. \"It is not possible that you will just throw an allegation to an athlete which is not supported by the relevant authorities -- in this case, WADA -- and then you say, OK, for these reasons, because some people are not happy, you keep them away from the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIt will likely be hard for many Olympic swimmers to trust WADA after it took three years for such a large number of failed tests to be made public. It will also likely be difficult for them to believe that WADA is doing what's best for all of its international athletes when its defense so far essentially amounts to, We just trusted CHINADA.\n\nExpect this case to be a topic of conversation at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Indianapolis and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"},

The exercises are the Russian president's latest salvo in a stand-off with the west over his invasion of Ukraine, during which Putin has repeatedly made veiled threats to use nuclear weapons. Russia said the drills, which cover non-strategic nuclear weapons that can be used in battlefield situations, were a response to \"provocative statements\" from western officials including Macron. The French president last week reaffirmed that he was leaving open the possibility of sending western troops to Ukraine, as he warned of the threat Russia's invasion poses to Europe. The Kremlin also signalled its ire with the US Senate, which passed a long-delayed $61bn aid package for Kyiv last month, as well as the UK, whose top diplomat Lord David Cameron said last week that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons against targets inside Russia. - FT\n\nEuropean intelligence agencies have warned their governments that Russia is plotting violent acts of sabotage across the continent as it commits to a course of permanent conflict with the west. Russia has already begun to more actively prepare covert bombings, arson attacks and damage to infrastructure on European soil, directly and via proxies, with little apparent concern about causing civilian fatalities, intelligence officials believe. While the Kremlin's agents have a long history of such operations -- and launched attacks sporadically in Europe in recent years -- evidence is mounting of a more aggressive and concerted effort, according to assessments from three different European countries shared with the Financial Times. Intelligence officials are becoming increasingly vocal about the threat in an effort to promote vigilance. \"We assess the risk of state-controlled acts of sabotage to be significantly increased,\" said Thomas Haldenwang, head of German domestic intelligence. Russia now seems comfortable carrying out operations on European soil \"[with] a high potential for damage,\" he told a security conference last month hosted by his agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. - FT\n\nIsraeli leaders have approved a military operation into the Gaza Strip city of Rafah, and Israeli forces are now striking targets in the area, officials announced Monday. The move came hours after Hamas announced it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, which could end seven months of war in Gaza, reported AP. Separately, Israeli forces are going to take over the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing in the next few hours, according to a CNN political and global affairs analyst, citing two sources.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to ensure more balanced trade with Europe as the three met in Paris on Monday at the start of Xi's two-day visit. Macron also pressed the Chinese leader to use his influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, while Xi said France and China should jointly aim to prevent a \"new Cold War\" between global blocks, on matters including trade. Xi arrived in Europe for the first time in five years, at a time of growing business tensions that include the European Union investigating Chinese industries such as electric vehicle exports, while Beijing probes mostly French-made brandy imports. Macron's official gifts for Xi included cognac by LVMH-owned Hennessey and Remy Cointreau, which are among the French companies affected by China's retaliatory anti-dumping brandy investigation. - France 24\n\nChinese drug cheats and officials willing to turn a blind eye threaten to make the Paris 2024 Olympics a \"train wreck,\" the top U.S. anti-doping regulator said. American regulator Travis Tygart accuses the World Anti-Doping Agency of \"allowing\" Chinese authority to cover up illegal drug-taking by top swimmers. Travis Tygart's trenchant remarks cast another shadow over Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ongoing visit to France where he is meeting President Emmanuel Macron, less than three months before the Olympics begin. Last month, The New York Times and German broadcaster ARD published a bombshell investigation revealing 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for prohibited drugs before the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but were still permitted to take part in the Games, with several winning medals. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the global drugs regulator for sport, accepted an explanation from Beijing's domestic watchdog, CHINADA, pinning the swimmers' failed tests on a contaminated hotel kitchen where the banned drug trimetazidine, known as TMZ, was present. Clean athletes and top figures fighting for drug-free sport are incensed at the revelations about the Chinese athletes at the Tokyo Games. Few more so than Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. \"Because of the cover-up that happened by China, and WADA allowing it, now that it's come to light it's going to be a train wreck waiting to happen going into Paris,\" Tygart said during an exclusive interview with POLITICO.\n\nA U.S. soldier was detained in Russia last week, a U.S. Army spokesperson said in a statement. The soldier, Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, had been stationed in South Korea and traveled to Russia on his own, not on official business, according to four U.S. officials. He had finished his deployment and was heading back to the U.S. when he made a side trip to Vladivostok, Russia, to visit a woman he was romantically involved with, officials said. They added that he had traveled there without permission from his superiors and that he is being held in pretrial confinement. The soldier is accused of stealing from a woman, the officials said. It was not immediately clear whether it was the same woman he was visiting. The soldier was detained Thursday, U.S. Army spokesperson Cynthia O. Smith said in a statement. - NBC\n\nColumbia University is canceling its large university-wide commencement ceremony amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests but will hold smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next, the university announced Monday. \"Based on feedback from our students, we have decided to focus attention on our Class Days and school-level graduation ceremonies, where students are honored individually alongside their peers, and to forego the university-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15,\" Columbia officials said in a statement.The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants. The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. - VOA", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType":

For example the NY Times reports that US team swimmer Paige Madden thinks medals from the Tokyo Olympics should be reallocated. \"I feel that Team USA was cheated.\" British swimmer James Guy says, \"Ban them all and never compete again.\" What might be considered whining and poor sportsmanship is effectively being encouraged by western media.\n\nThe NYTimes and ARD are the same two media that precipitated the accusations of \"state sponsored doping\" in Russia. It did enormous damage to thousands of Russian athletes and resulted in different levels of banning starting with the Rio Olympics in 2016. Although widely accepted as \"truth\" in the West, the claims of widespread Russian doping were weak when evidence was required. Most Russian athletes who challenged their banning were exonerated. The major accusers, the Stepanovs and Grigory Rodchenkov, were themselves guilty of doping and profiting from doping. Despite this, the banning has continued and escalated after the Russian intervention in Ukraine. The accusations and banning were useful in propelling the \"new cold war\" and \"new McCarthyism\".\n\nNYT and ARD, and their anonymous informants, may be seeking to do something similar to China. USADA has issued a response in which they say China may be engaging in \"systematic doping\" under a \"coordinated doping regime\". On May 6 USADA's Tygart escalated his attacks. He implies the Paris Olympics will be a \"train wreck\" because of WADA complicity in China's \"cheating\". He hopes the US government will \"step in and help lead and fix this.\" Surely a recipe for success.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nOn Jan. 1-3 in 2021, the Chinese swim team was having a domestic swim meet. It was in the midst of covid lockdown. As usual, the team was drug tested but this time a strange thing happened: many swimmers tested positive for a trace amount of the banned medication trimetazadine (TMZ).\n\nThe China Anti Doping Agency (CHINADA) investigated and reported the facts to the World Anti Doping Agency as required. They found:\n\n23 swimmers tested positive for a very small amount of trimetazadine (TMZ) the swimmers were from different regions of China with different coaches and trainers all 23 were staying at the same hotel eating in the same dining room none of the swimmers staying at a different hotel tested positive some of the swimmers tested positive one day, negative the next tests in the hotel kitchen showed the presence of TMZ on the air vent and counters\n\nCHINADA concluded the positive TMZ tests were from hotel food and the athletes were not at fault.\n\nThey reported the incident and investigation to the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) and the international swimming federation now known as World Aquatics (formerly FINA). Both organizations examined the facts and agreed with the findings.\n\nBecause the athletes were deemed to have no fault, the incident and names of the athletes were not publicized. WADA regulations indicate that there should be no publicity or naming of athletes deemed innocent and without an \"Anti Doping Rule Violation\" (ADRV).\n\nHow It Has Been Reported\n\nApproximately a year later, in 2022, anonymous sources reported this incident to the NY Times and ARD. Since then, the two media outlets have done further investigation but kept the story secret until two weeks ago.\n\nThey suggest something shady happened back in early 2021. They suggest WADA may be complicit in covering up anti doping violations. They almost encourage western athletes to challenge the Chinese swimming accomplishments and be \"angry\". On April 20 the story was \"Top Chinese Swimmers Tested Positive for Banned Drug, Then Won Olympic Gold\". On April 21 the story was \"'Team USA Was Cheated': Chinese Doping Case Exposes Rift in Swimming\". On April 22 the story was \"Top Biden Official Calls for Inquiry Into Chinese Doping Case.\"\n\nThese reports ignited a flood of other sensational and accusatory reports and editorials. The Guardian report is titled \"Poison in the pool: why the latest Chinese doping row is proving so toxic\". Sports Yahoo says \"Extremely concerned Olympians will not let the Chinese doping allegations die\". The PBS News Hour had a video report titled \"Chinese doping 'swept under the carpet': US anti-doping chief says\". Sports Illustrated said the news may alter the distribution of medals from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the situation. .\n\nThe NY Times and ARD say they have been investigating this story for two years. The release appears timed to have maximum impact and possible damage, just months before the Paris Olympics.\n\nUSADA Accuses WADA\n\nThe US Anti Doping Agency (USADA) is led by the hyper-aggressive Travis Tyler. He has used the reports to claim that WADA is complicit in a Chinese \"cover-up\". In a TV interview before a large national audience Tygart said,\n\n\"China didn't follow the rules. They effectively swept this under the carpet because they didn't find a violation. They didn't announce a violation. They didn't disqualify the athletes from the event at which they tested positive. And this is absolutely mandatory under the world anti-doping code that all nations are required to follow.\"\n\nWADA has responded that Tygart's comments seem \"politically motivated\". They say CHINADA followed the rules, investigated and reported as required. They say China did NOT have to announce it to the world, or name the individual athletes for the very good reason that false accusations of doping can destroy a career. WADA regulations say the names of athletes should NOT be publicized until or unless it is confirmed they have an Anti Doping Rule Violation.\n\nWADA Appoints Independent Investigator\n\nWADA is the international organization charged with supervising global anti-doping in sports. With its headquarters in Canada and most of its leaders from NATO countries, it is a largely western organization.\n\nThey are highly sensitive to criticism from the West. It has pushed back against some of the most extreme criticism, for example from the USADA head. They have also appointed an independent investigator to review what happened in China and whether WADA was correct to accept the Chinese investigation and report.\n\nWADA appointed Eric Cottier, the prosecutor general of a Swiss region. WADA headquarters are in Canada but the organization is registered in Switzerland. USADA has criticized the appointment suggesting that Cottier is not sufficiently \"independent\".\n\nThoms Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee, has voiced support for WADA.\n\nWADA has defended their actions in a press conference and fact sheet about the case.\n\nThe controversy may quiet down. But a lot of poison has been spread around. Encouraged by the NY Times and other media, numerous western athletes now claim they feel \"cheated\" out of medals at the Tokyo Olympics since 5 medals were won by Chinese swimmers involved in the TMZ \"doping scandal\".\n\nIt is also possible the controversy will continue. Will the \"Sports Czar\" of the Biden Administration get involved? Will the FBI be designated to investigate? These are now possible in the wake of the Rodchenkov Anti Doping Act which passed Congress in 2020.\n\nReader comments following articles indicate there is a wellspring of anti-China hostility encouraged by the accusations. The most popular comment on this article says, \"When will democracies learn that authoritarian regimes play dirty, and should be viewed as suspect not deserving of good faith.\" Another says,\"No one knows doping like China knows doping, China knows doping best.\" Another one says, \"China cheats. Russia cheats. Just like the East Germans did before them. Their governments will meet the same fate as they did.\"\n\nPushback\n\nThere has been some pushback to the sensational anti-China accusations. For example Denis Cotterell is a world class coach who has trained both Australian and Chinese Olympic swimmers. He has spoken out strongly in support of the Chinese swimmers. He says, \"I can see what they (the swimmers) go through. I see the measures... The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time. They are so adamant on having clean sport.\"\n\nAn insightful article from an Australian academic sports authority and popular sports commentator suggests there are political forces at work: \"WADA - like the United Nations and other organizations - finds itself in the cross hairs of the great power struggle of our time: a rising China and its challenge to US dominance.\"\n\nGeopolitical Consequences\n\nAccording to the \"2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community\", China is \"challenging longstanding rules of the international system as well as U.S. primacy within it.\" China's positive \"international image\" is a challenge to U.S. leadership. By this logic, it is in the US interests to damage China's international reputation and standing.\n\nThis raises the question: How did the TMZ get into the hotel kitchen and into the food being served to these Chinese athletes?\n\nIn February 2022, accusations of intentional doping were heaped on the Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva. A trace amount of trimetazadine (TMZ) was detected in a drug test taken seven weeks before the Beijing Olympics. There are similarities to the Chinese case: same drug, same trace amount detected, same mystery as to how it was ingested.\n\nBecause she could not explain how it got there, Valieva was condemned in the West and ultimately had her international career destroyed. The Russian figure skating sweep was prevented and the Russian team lost their gold medals. The controversy distracted and partially ruined the Beijing Olympics. The \"intelligence community\" undoubtedly considers this a success.\n\nHow did the TMZ get in the hotel kitchen in China? Who are the \"whistle blowers\" who informed the New York Times and ARD and supplied the names of the athletes who tested positive for the trace amount of TMZ?\n\nThe anti doping crusade is being manipulated by powerful forces with ignoble intentions.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

In the interview, which was aired on KSTP-TV's \"5 Eyewitness News Nightcast\" channel, Gwen could be heard talking about the riots and her choice to leave the \"windows open as long\" as the city was burned by looters and rioters. (RELATED: Tim Walz Turned His State Into A Destination For Late-Term Abortions)\n\n\"I could smell the burning tires. That was a very real thing, and I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,\" Gwen Walz said.\n\nMinneapolis was quickly swarmed by rioters after the death of George Floyd in 2020, leading to many buildings being burned down and businesses looted, with the violence lasting for three days.\n\nFollowing the reveal of Walz as Harris' running mate, Republican lawmakers and others online quickly pointed out how Walz failed to immediately send the National Guard into Minneapolis to address the violence occurring at the time. Walz had previously argued that calling the National Guard would only incite further rioting, as he had suggested protesters needed space to express their outrage, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I want to just be clear there's philosophically an argument to be made that an armed presence on the ground in the midst of where we just had a police killing is seen as a catalyst,\" Walz said at the time.\n\nWalz's office and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That was a very real thing, and I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nThis statement has sparked controversy and raised questions about the Walz family's perspective on the violent events that unfolded in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd.\n\nDaily Caller reported that the riots, which lasted for three days, saw widespread looting and the burning of numerous buildings in Minneapolis.\n\nThe intensity of the situation prompted calls for immediate action, with many criticizing Walz's initial response to the unrest.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and online commentators have been quick to point out that Governor Walz hesitated to deploy the National Guard to quell the violence.\n\nAt the time, Walz defended his decision, arguing that an armed presence might escalate tensions further.\n\n\"I want to just be clear there's philosophically an argument to be made that an armed presence on the ground in the midst of where we just had a police killing is seen as a catalyst,\" Walz stated during the crisis, as highlighted by Daily Caller.\n\nFox News reported that this approach, which prioritized giving protesters space to express their outrage, has come under renewed scrutiny in light of the recent revelations.\n\nCritics argue that the delay in deploying the National Guard allowed the situation to spiral out of control, resulting in extensive property damage and endangering lives.\n\nThe resurfaced interview with Gwen Walz has added a personal dimension to the political debate surrounding the handling of the 2020 riots.\n\nHer comments have been interpreted by some as insensitive to the destruction and fear experienced by many Minneapolis residents during that tumultuous period.\n\nAdding more fuel to the Walz family controversy, their daughter Hope tweeted out the line position of the National Guard in an attempt to protect rioters.\n\n\"His daughter is as insane as Kamala's unnatural daughter, it seems,\" one X user posted.\n\nAs the 2024 election campaign gains momentum, the Walz family's stance on law enforcement and public safety is likely to face increased scrutiny.\n\nNeither Governor Walz's office nor the Harris campaign has responded to requests for comment on the matter, Daily Caller and Fox noted.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this revelation will impact public perception of the Harris-Walz ticket and their approach to issues of civil unrest and public safety.\n\nThe resurfacing of this interview highlights the enduring impact of the 2020 riots on American politics and public discourse.", "source": {"uri": "resistthemainstream.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Resist the Mainstream"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordyn_m@resistthemainstream.com",

Tim Walz dilly-dallied for days, resisting pleas for him to call in the National Guard to quell the growing riots as Minneapolis burned. A few months later, local news station KSTP interviewed Tim and Gwen Walz about the state's COVID response and the Black Lives Matter riots.\n\nGov. Walz's wife, Gwen, made a bizarre and disgusting statement about what she did in those first few days.\n\nHere's what she said in the clip:\n\n\"I would say those first days, you know, when there were riots, I could smell the burning tires, and that was -- that was a very real thing. And I kept the windows open for as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nWho thinks to do that? Did she keep the windows open for as long as she could as a \"weird\" way to feel solidarity with the rioters? Or was she savoring the smell of burning tires, burning stores, burning police stations, burning dreams? Or both?\n\nIn those first days, Walz's daughter, Hope, made sure rioters knew that the National Guard was not going to be deployed on the night of May 28 so they could continue their rampage.\n\nShe tweeted [spelling and capitalization original]:\n\n\"Could someone who actually has followers rely [sic] to the masses that ... the [National] guard [sic] WILL NOT be present tonight? there is a lot of misinformation that is further spreading fear and chaos at the scene of the protests.\"\n\nAnd then in another tweet:\n\nthe guard cannot be sent in minutes. It takes time for them to deploy because they come from all over the state. to be clear, the national guard will not be present tonight.\n\nAnd in a third:\n\njust because someone asked for something doesn't mean it's happening right away or even happening at all. i don't know about swat but what i do know is that the guard will not be present arresting people tongiht.\n\nThat night a six-story housing project and the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct burned, and several stores were looted. As reported by American Experiment in an excellent article detailing the timeline of Walz's failure to respond, it seems that Hope Walz was sharing information she had access to through her father:\n\nWalz activated the National Guard at 2:30 p.m. Thursday May 28. But eight hours later, only 90 National Guard soldiers were on the ground across the Twin Cities. By that time, officers had already evacuated the Third Precinct after it was besieged by protesters.\n\nBy their words and actions, it's clear that the entire Walz family stood in solidarity with the anti-American hooligans who sought to destroy the businesses and homes of the people in Minneapolis who could least afford to have their neighborhoods destroyed, like this woman:\n\nI should note that, in an effort to provide context to Walz's remarks in the video, I looked for a full clip of the interview to see what was said before that, whether Walz was responding to a question or not, but KSTP removed the video from that story and I was not able to find the video on YouTube. KSTP's story does have Walz's quote, though, the video clip isn't a fake. Here's how KSTP wrote up Walz's comments:\n\n\"With COVID-19, the entire state was watching what Tim did,\" said Ms. Walz. \"But with Mr. Floyd's death, it was the entire country and the whole world looking at and watching what we did here in Minnesota in response to that.\"\n\n\"Again we had more sleepless nights during the riots,\" Walz said. \"I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing. I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nThrough it all, Walz said she and the governor prayed, leaned on family and friends and were lifted up by the generous support of Minnesotans along the way.\n\n\"There have been, I think, two different times when we just stopped and shed some tears,\" Walz said. \"He doesn't throw himself down on the bed and sob, but there have been tears.\"\n\nYes, the world was watching to see what she and her husband did, and I doubt that Tim Walz shed any tears for the hardworking Minnesotans who were victims of the riots.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_van_laar@redstate.com", "name": "Jennifer Van Laar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTP-TV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KSTP-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tire fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/150/bbc4df3f-4977-4c54-bc97-2a6c7ade86fd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796650", "eventUri": "eng-9796650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-28", "textStart": 1236, "textEnd": 1242, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 141, "textEnd": 149}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The incident saw Gov. Walz align with the violent protesters, a fact that is coming back to haunt him now that he's the running mate for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nPerhaps more subtly disturbing are the actions of the state's first lady.\n\n\"With COVID-19, the entire state was watching what Tim did, but with Mr. Floyd's death, it was the entire country and the whole world looking at and watching what we did here in Minnesota in response to that,\" Gwen Walz told KSTP-TV in July 2021.\n\n\"Again we had more sleepless nights during the riots,\" she said. \"I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing.\n\n\"I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nAs anyone watching the government-enabled collapse of social order after Floyd's death knows, it wasn't just tires that rioters were burning. In some instances, the smells coming though Mrs. Walz's windows could have easily been charred human flesh.\n\nAt least one of the deaths that occurred during the Minneapolis riots was due to rioters burning down an occupied building.\n\nMontez Lee, a 25-year-old man, was recorded boasting in front of the burning Max-It Pawn building on May 28 about starting the inferno, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Videos of the blaze and its towering smoke column spread like wildfire across social media, becoming an early indicator of what was to come for other American cities.\n\nTwo months after the blaze died down, authorities found a charred body amidst the rubble.\n\nAccording to KMSP-TV, the deceased was identified as 30-year-old Oscar Lee Stuart Jr. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office determined Stuart likely died of \"inhalation of combustion and thermal injury.\"\n\nLee, the man seen boasting in front of Max-It Pawn, was convicted of sparking the deadly fire.\n\nAt least two others were killed in the fiery riots.\n\nThe smell of destruction isn't pleasant -- all the thick, black smoke seen in riot footage is the result of burning plastics, petrochemicals and other inorganic and organic material, resulting in noxious clouds.\n\nTo be around this toxic smoke is unpleasant. To be in it is torturous.\n\nIf the governor and first lady wanted a \"touchstone\" moment, they should have spoken with the people whose lives were ruined by the chaos allowed to rage with leftist applause in Minneapolis.\n\nInstead, the death and destruction that burned the city were used as incense for contemplation at the Walz home.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType":

Once again, across every category touches upon the key figure of today's top story, the selection of MN governor Tim Walz for the veep slot on the Democrat ticket, and just what a completely horrendous character he is and what his party and movement represent. That is, the dismantling and destruction of America as founded.\n\nGoing to start by taking credit. I called that it would be Tim Walz two weeks ago.\n\nI knew by paying attention to the leaks coming out of the Dems. Walz was the preferred choice by Obama, but a puzzling one. On the face it looks like they are weak in Minnesota, but I think it really was a matter of having no good choices.\n\nThe Dems wanted someone else on the top of the ticket, preferably Whitmer who polled the best. But they are stuck with Harris, who is living down to their expectations. She is a terrible candidate.Whitmer made it clear she was not interested in VP, I suspect because she plans to be the nominee in 2028.\n\nNext choice was Kelly, but he has too many Chinese connections in the closet.\n\nWhile on paper Shapiro looks like the best choice because Harris cannot win without PA, he is a slimy weasel and has massive baggage. When I saw that \"leaked\" video over the weekend, I knew he wasn't the choice. That was a trick to try to force him into the position.\n\nButtigeg was never a choice.

Tim Walz, and their daughter Hope Walz during the George Floyd riots is a prime example of why I detest white progressive elites.\n\nThe issue isn't just about the comments these people made, but what their words reveal about the deeper, more insidious nature of progressive politics. It serves as a stark reminder that the plight of black Americans is nothing more than an instrument for their incessant virtue signaling as their policies continue destroying black communities.\n\nNEW: Tim Walz Now Caught in a Scandal Involving a Muslim Cleric and Adolf Hitler\n\nVIDEO: While Minneapolis Burned, Walz's Wife Threw Her Windows Open to Enjoy the Smell of Burning Tires\n\nDuring a 2020 interview, Gwen Walz described her experience during the riots in Minneapolis in a disturbingly cavalier manner.\n\n\"I would say those first days, you know, when there were riots, I could smell the burning tires, and that was -- that was a very real thing. And I kept the windows open for as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nNote how Gwen seems to romanticize the destruction that engulfed predominantly black neighborhoods in Minneapolis. This is beyond tone-deaf. It betrays a remarkable lack of concern for the black lives and property that were damaged and destroyed.\n\nTim and Gwen's daughter was even worse. Hope Walz attempted to help the rioters burn down black communities by posting information about National Guard movements to help the thugs avoid being arrested.\n\nThe damage wrought by the rioters was devastating - especially to black neighborhoods in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the first few days after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, rioters tore through dense stretches of Minneapolis, St. Paul and other metro communities in retaliation, causing millions in property damage to more than 1,500 locations.\n\nIn their wake, vandals left a trail of smashed doors and windows, covered hundreds of boarded-up businesses with graffiti and set fire to nearly 150 buildings, with dozens burned to the ground. Pharmacies, groceries, liquor stores, tobacco shops and cell phone stores were ransacked, losing thousands of dollars in stolen merchandise. Many were looted repeatedly over consecutive nights.\n\nThe behavior of the Walz family during the riots, coupled with the governor's inept handling of the unrest, encapsulates everything that is wrong with the white progressive elite. They purport to champion the cause of black Americans while feigning concern for black Americans when it suits their political agenda. Yet, their actions expose a complete disregard for those they claim to support.\n\nGwen Walz's remarks about leaving her windows open to smell the destruction are nothing short of grotesque. It's easy for her ilk to romanticize the violence when it's not her neighborhood that's burning.\n\nMoreover, Hope Walz's actions during the riots underscore the hypocrisy that runs deep within progressive circles. By providing rioters with information that could have helped them avoid the National Guard, Hope wasn't just a passive observer; she was an active participant in the chaos that destroyed countless black lives and black livelihoods.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan would be proud.\n\nThis provides yet another example of how progressives exploit the plight of the black community to signal their virtue to their fellow elites and advance the political agenda. They are quick to voice their support for movements like Black Lives Matter but are comfortably insulated from the consequences of the atrocious policies they support.\n\nHow eager would Gwen Walz have been to \"smell the burning tires\" if Antifa thugs were torching her neighborhood? Would Hope Walz have been so gung-ho about aiding the rioters if they were threatening the area where she lives?\n\nOf course not. For these people, it's just fine when death and destruction affect black folks as long as they don't have to bear the ramifications of what they support.\n\nLet's not forget that these are the same people who consistently push for policies that harm the very communities they claim to champion. They support lax crime policies, despite the fact that black neighborhoods are often the hardest hit by rising rates of criminality. They fight against school choice even though most black parents favor having more educational options. And when their policies inevitably lead to chaos and destruction, they sit back and romanticize the violence from the safety of their privileged enclaves.\n\nIn many cases, white progressives actively participate in the destruction. Many, if not most, of those rioting in cities across the country were white progressives LARPing as pro-black activists. There were plenty of videos showing black residents begging these white progressives to stop the violence because the black folks would be the ones dealing with the fallout after the Antifa thugs went back to their parents' basements.\n\nTim Walz's family represents the worst of progressive hypocrisy. They pretend to care about black Americans while using us as pawns in their political game. The Walz family's behavior during the 2020 riots is just the latest example of how progressives exploit our suffering for their gain. It's time we see these people for what they truly are: disgusting scum who push this agenda because they know they will never have to face the consequences.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/153/a543cd14-0624-4cd6-ab99-06b07eb9497e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796650", "eventUri": "eng-9796650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

One lies about his military record and has a record of left-wing extremism, with a devoted spouse endorsing and enabling this mayhem. CBS News had this mini profile on Mrs. Walz:\n\nGwen Walz, n\u00e9e Whipple, was born in Glencoe, about 55 miles west of Minneapolis, and raised in western Minnesota by her parents Val and Linn. She has three sisters.\n\nShe attended Gustavus Adolphus in St. Peter, then started her teaching career in Nebraska, where she met her future husband, Tim Walz.\n\nThe two married in 1994 and moved to Mankato in 1996, where she taught for more than two decades.\n\nWhen Tim Walz was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018, the family moved to St. Paul. They have two children, Hope and Gus.\n\nAccording to her state bio, some of her passions include \"teaching at prisons and promoting criminal justice reform, to advocating for the LGBTQ movement\" with a goal to \"build a more just and equitable world.\"\n\nAnd the building of that \"more just and equitable world\" comes with taking sick enjoyment of watching violent leftists burn down portions of the state your husband is governing. The woman is nutty, saying in 2020 that she loved huffing the fumes of burning tires as unhinged left-wingers burned cities to the ground.\n\n\"I could smell the burning tires,\" she said. \"I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\"\n\nShe also thinks repeat criminal offenders deserve as many chances as possible.\n\nIt's a marriage made in heaven for the Walz and a total nightmare for the country.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt Vespa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linn County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Linn County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gustavus Adolphus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Peter, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Peter, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tire fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2014/149/3a9b1524-210f-46b2-8e09-c4caf8c9dc59.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796650", "eventUri": "eng-9796650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

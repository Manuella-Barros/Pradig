{"id": 243339606, "title": "How RFK Jr. Is Seizing on Biden\u2019s Debate Nightmare", "text": "For weeks, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. railed against the first presidential debate. CNN, the debate\u2019s host, determined that Kennedy had not qualified for the ballot in enough states to appear on stage. As their party\u2019s presumptive nominees, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will qualify for the ballot later this summer. Kennedy\u2019s campaign filed an FEC complaint against CNN and even threatened legal action against everyone at the company involved in debate planning. But Kennedy may have won the debate without even showing up. Biden\u2019s performance was widely panned, even by members of his own party, for his hoarse voice and trains of thought that appeared to go off the tracks. Though Trump claimed victory, he peddled numerous falsehoods including on immigration and abortion. However, Kennedy is taking advantage of the discontent by focusing most of his fire on just one of them. \u201cWe have 341 million people in this country and to think those are the best two candidates the political parties can come up with is depressing,\u201d Kennedy said in a press release after the debate. \u201cLast night was a disaster for President Biden,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s statement continued. \u201cI think people saw how frail he was and even the hardcore Democrats have lost faith that he can even win the election or more importantly, that he can run the country. He seemed very confused. It\u2019s scary to think that he\u2019s going to get the call at 3 in the morning, maybe, that we all dread, and he has 6 minutes to make a decision that will affect the lives of everybody on this planet.\u201d Asked for additional details about Kennedy\u2019s reaction to the debate, the campaign pointed The Daily Beast back to the press release. Both parties have fretted that Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could siphon votes away from them, but there has been plenty of argument over whether his independent bid will hurt Biden or Trump more. Kennedy\u2019s comments about last night\u2019s debate suggest he sees Biden as its biggest loser. Reached for comment, a Biden campaign aide did not address concerns about Biden\u2019s age and ability to think on his feet, but shared that the campaign brought in $14 million on Thursday and into Friday morning. ActBlue, the online fundraising platform for Democrats, also shared on X that it raised nearly $22 million from small-dollar donors on June 27, making debate day ActBlue\u2019s biggest fundraising day of the cycle. The Kennedy campaign did not address a question from The Daily Beast about how debate night impacted RFK Jr.\u2019s fundraising. But American Values, the big-money super PAC supporting Kennedy, did a victory dance. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement,\u201d American Values\u2019 treasurer, Tony Lyons, wrote in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cEveryone sees this as a game changer. It\u2019s clear that Biden is bi-done and anyone who doesn\u2019t want Trump to be their president recognizes now that a vote for Bobby Kennedy is a vote for Bobby Kennedy. He\u2019s the only candidate who can beat Trump.\u201d On Friday morning, a new filing with the Federal Election Commission showed that American Values launched a big messaging push in support of the candidate on Thursday; the report of independent expenditures noted the PAC was spending nearly three-quarters of a million dollars for nationwide ads on X, as well as $121,000 worth of national newspaper ads in USA Today. According to American Values, its ads on X\u2014which say it began #therealdebate\u2014were viewed by 36 million people and drove viewers to a 30-minute video about Kennedy. The X ads, along with the PAC\u2019s USA Today ones, invited voters to \u201cjoin the rebellion.\u201d The FEC filing also listed $7,500 in new spending for video production on Friday. During an MSNBC hit about the debate, Kennedy continued to go after the president, promising that he \u201cwould take a spoiler pledge with Biden.\u201d In October, Kennedy said, whichever of the two men polling finds is less likely to defeat Trump should drop out of the race. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s national polling average currently has Biden and Trump neck-and-neck, with the former president slightly ahead at 41.4 percent compared to the current president\u2019s 40.5 percent. Kennedy is way behind at 9 percent, and isn\u2019t doing much better in polls of individual swing states. But Kennedy has drawn some interest from constituencies Democrats have traditionally counted on for robust support, like young people, African Americans, and Latino voters. As debate reactions poured into reporters\u2019 inboxes Thursday night and Friday morning, many of the most disaffected came from these groups. Still, not all the reactions point in the same direction. A Univision focus group of undecided Latino voters, for instance, showed that some were more supportive of Biden after the debate. The week before the debate, a Democratic National Committee memo noted that Kennedy\u2019s favorability rating has been on the decline. It will take time for pollsters to determine if that trend continues afterwards. \"The more voters learn about RFK Jr. the less they like him,\u201d wrote DNC spokesman Matt Corridoni in a statement to The Daily Beast.", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240628-rfk-biden-debate-hero_i0zcyo\"/><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Erin O\u2019Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>For weeks, independent presidential candidate<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/robert-f-kennedy-jr\"> Robert F.

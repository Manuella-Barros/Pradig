Vance (R-OH), a leading possible contender for former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, answered several key questions from Breitbart News for this exclusive question-and-answer written interview about Hollywood star Robert De Niro\u2019s appearance at the behest of Democrat President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump is being tried. The moment, one of the most consequential of this 2024 presidential election so far, represents a significant escalation by the incumbent president of the United States against his political opponent. It\u2019s also a moment that Vance, who may end up being Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick, thinks political prognosticators will look back on as similar to failed 2016 Democrat presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s infamous speech where she attacked Trump\u2019s supporters in 2016 as being \u201cirredeemable\u201d people she considered in the \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d That\u2019s because De Niro, on Biden\u2019s behalf at the formal Biden campaign event outside the courthouse, attacked Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cgangsters\u201d and \u201cclowns.\u201d Vance\u2019s written interview here also gives critical insight into electoral victory strategy for Trump, and how the former president should continue on working class and rust belt voters in states like Vance\u2019s Ohio and nearby Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and more. Vance\u2019s advice for Trump on how he strengthens his already \u201cpowerful\u201d connection with such working class voters is key for the former president as he embarks on an effort to pull off the greatest political comeback in the history of mankind. HAHAHAHA https://t.co/L1up5wLWFw \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 28, 2024 Most importantly, too, Vance argues that this incident with De Niro at the Biden campaign event outside the Manhattan courthouse demonstrates once and for all what Trump and his supporters have long been saying: Biden is behind these political prosecutions of Trump, and weaponized the government either through his own administration or through his allies including Democrat, George Soros-funded prosecutors like Alvin Bragg in Manhattan or Fani Willis in Atlanta. Vance called this a \u201cmask off moment for the Biden regime\u201d and his insights on this in particular are revealing. So, without further ado, here is a full transcript of the back-and-forth Breitbart News had with Sen. Vance on Tuesday afternoon in between fundraising events for Trump on this in the aftermath of De Niro\u2019s big Biden campaign moment. BREITBART NEWS NETWORK (BNN): What do you think of the Biden campaign decision to bring out of all people Robert De Niro and on of all days the day of closing arguments to stage a press conference outside the Trump trial courthouse? SEN. J.D. VANCE: Well first of all, what business does the president have at the show trial of his chief political rival? The impartial administration of justice requires that jurors not feel intimidated. Would you feel intimidated if the president sent a bunch of hacks to yell outside of the courtroom? The Biden administration\u2019s entire argument up to this point is that this is a local case in New York. They\u2019re not involved at all. So they decide to show up during closing arguments and stage a campaign rally? De Niro is of course a joke. His wild gesticulation, what he said. He\u2019s a washed up actor campaigning for a washed up president. We\u2019ve been saying this entire trial is political theater for Joe Biden. And he decides to send a literal actor to a campaign rally on the day of closing arguments? It\u2019s like the Democrats are trying to make our argument for us. BNN: De Niro at various points during his public appearance today called Trump supporters \u201cclowns\u201d or \u201cgangsters.\u201d Is this eerily reminiscent of when Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters in the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d who are \u201cirredeemable\u201d? VANCE: That\u2019s exactly what I thought. It\u2019s rule one of American politics: attack the candidate, attack their campaign, attack their policies, but don\u2019t attack the voters. The whole idea of an election is to persuade voters, not insult them. So you have a rich actor stand before a courthouse and call people names? That\u2019s the Biden administration\u2019s campaign strategy? It\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re flailing. The contrast with the Trump campaign is really incredible. A week ago Trump goes to the South Bronx to campaign in a traditionally Democratic area. His message? We\u2019re all Americans. We\u2019re all on the same team. Joe Biden has failed you, and I want to help you. Oh, brother. pic.twitter.com/hIevpJQd5S \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 28, 2024 The Biden campaign\u2019s message is: don\u2019t believe your lying eyes. Inflation isn\u2019t bad. America isn\u2019t losing our place in the world. Everything\u2019s fine. And if you disagree, you\u2019re a clown or a gangster. The Trump campaign treats Americans with respect and dignity. The Biden campaign treats us like children. We\u2019ll see which approach works in November. BNN: While all of this is happening, the Biden team is not focusing on the concerns of working class Americans in rust belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, et cetera. Just today, the Democrat County Executive of Macomb County in Michigan announced he is not supporting Biden this year. Do you think the tone deafness of the Biden operation provides an opening for Trump to reconnect with these rust belt voters and flip these states back to being red in November? VANCE: One of the things that occurred to me as I watched De Niro make a fool of himself is that Trump voters, and especially rural white people, are the last group of people in the country it\u2019s OK to insult. Can you imagine if De Niro called any other group of voters \u201cgangsters\u201d? It would be a career ending move. I think it does give Trump a huge opening. His connection to these voters has always been very powerful, and I think it rests on two things. The first is that Trump says what he thinks. Agree or disagree with him, it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s not selling a load of bullshit. Working people are blunt because they respect one another to be honest and direct. The second thing Trump has going for him is that people can tell he actually likes them and respects them as human beings. For a long time, a lot of Democrat and even many Republican politicians were ashamed of normal Americans. They think their values are backwards, their patriotism is tacky, and their jobs are part of the old economy. But here\u2019s the thing people are waking up to: if a politician disrespects you, is he ever going to fight for you, your job, or your family? A campaign that dispatches an actor to call you a gangster doesn\u2019t give a shit about you. When they ship their job to China they won\u2019t even feel guilty about it. Trump has an opportunity to say: I am your champion. I am the guy who will fight for your wages, your job, your public safety, your local community. Don\u2019t entrust the guy who insults you with more power. Entrust me, the guy who actually respects you. It\u2019s a huge opportunity for him to sweet working class voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. BNN: Having a Hollywood elitist like De Niro of all people \u2014 famous for his roles as a mobster in films like The Godfather, Casino, The Irishman, and more \u2014 lecturing tens of millions of Americans on the stakes of the 2024 election while calling them \u201cgangsters\u201d seems especially ironic but perhaps even more incredible in the sense that it shows the various sides in this election quite clearly. You\u2019ve got Hollywood elitists, Wall Street bankers, and connected, high-powered career politicians on one side, and the working class union workers and families struggling due to Biden\u2019s inflation and immigration policies on the other. What say you about the contrast here? VANCE: Yeah it\u2019s ironic. De Niro has gotten rich playing gangsters on the big screen and now he wants to call the people who build our buildings and make the things we use every day gangsters? Sometimes we overcomplicate this stuff. Robert De Niro and other Hollywood elitists like illegal immigration because they gets cheaper servants at their mansions without ever having to meet a normal citizen of their own country. Wall Street likes cheap labor because they get rich from it. And Democrat politicians get more votes. Normal Americans get fentanyl in their communities, illegal criminals on their streets, and lower wages for their work. Donald Trump stands for higher wages and safer streets. Joe Biden stands for cheap labor and fentanyl. We need to take that message all the way to November. BNN: Most amazingly about this moment, though, perhaps is the fact that after years of denying it, the Biden campaign\u2019s decision to do this seems to confirm what we all knew all along which is that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the Democrats are behind this political prosecution for political purposes. What do you think about the optics of the Biden campaign engaging in a political stunt like this? Is the cat out of the bag now for good? VANCE: As you know, Matt, I\u2019m not afraid of a partisan fight. Some issues really are Democrats versus Republicans. But this is about whether we\u2019re a corrupt country. Do we want the standard to be that you can try to throw your political opponents in jail for winning elections they should have lost? Do we want the president sending his attorneys to a local prosecutors office to go after his rival? And then following it up with a campaign rally on jury instruction day? If this isn\u2019t political, why hold a campaign rally the day the jury deliberates on the verdict? This is a mask off moment for the Biden regime, and I use that word carefully. For the first time in my life, we have an administration that is willing to shred nearly three centuries of legal tradition to gain power. Our ancestors fought, bled, and died to give us the kind of country where \u201cequal justice under the law\u201d meant something. Biden and his cronies are willing to throw it all away to win an election. I\u2019m optimistic because I don\u2019t think it will work. I really do think Trump will win. But then we need to have courage as Republicans to make sure that those who corrupted our system of justice are punished for it. If these guys suffer no consequences for what they did to Trump, they will eventually do it to every Republican elected official in the country. That\u2019s how banana republics work. It never stops with just the guy on top.", "summary": "<p>Sen. J.D.

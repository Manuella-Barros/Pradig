The Super League has been given Division 1 status by the United States Soccer Federation, which means the league is on par with the NWSL.\n\nSeason ticket holders for both Louisville City and Racing Louisville will receive presale access to tickets for the October USWNT match. Access will also be available to fans who make a deposit toward LouCity or Racing Louisville season tickets for 2025.\n\nThe presale for tickets for the match will begin Tuesday and continue until 8 a.m. Friday.

Although the Albiceleste failed to advance from the group stages, they lost 1-0 to Italy, drew 2-2 with South Africa and lost 2-0 to Sweden.\n\nThe United States has faced Argentina four times in its history, but the two teams have not met since February 2021, when they won 6-0 in Orlando, Florida, at the SheBelieves Cup as the soccer world was emerging from the global pandemic.\n\nTICKETS\n\nPre-sales for the USWNT vs. Argentina match in Louisville will begin on Tuesday, August 6 and end on Friday, August 9 at 8 a.m. local time.\n\nCoaches Circle and Presidents Circle members who support the US Soccer Development Fund are eligible for one-on-one customer support and concierge services for their ticketing needs.

Therefore, she believes that learning English is crucial for advancing in the job market in the state.\n\n\"When you arrive and start talking to someone, to the manager, in Spanish through a translator, you immediately lose credibility.

Both parties had 180 days to negotiate the terms of a development agreement after signing the letter of intent, but despite \"significant progress being made,\" that still hasn't happened.\n\nHowever new documents signed July 15 reveal Metro Government and RCEG agreed to amend the original letter of intent to extend the negotiation period through July 2025 to give RCEG more time to complete further investigations of the property.\n\nThe $65 million Louisville Gardens redevelopment project includes plans for new stages for film, music and digital productions. The building's fa\u00e7ade will also be restored back to the original design of the Louisville Armory.\n\nPlans also call for a building behind the Louisville Gardens on Cedar Street to be converted into an educational facility for local universities.\n\nRCEG said it's still interested in the property and has started researching structural and construction costs of the project, according to city documents.\n\nDue to the building's previous uses, a 2016 environmental assessment found the Louisville Gardens needed remediation. A city official said the remediation process began in 2022 and concluded in March 2024.\n\nThe historic building, which occupies an entire city block, first opened in 1905 as the Jefferson County Armory and drill hall. By 1923, public events took over and the building was transformed into an entertainment venue.\n\nA young Cassius Clay, before he was known as Muhammad Ali, fought there in the 1950s as part of the Louisville Golden Gloves Boxing tournament. It was even home to the Kentucky Colonels basketball team, and Elvis Presley performed there in 1956.\n\nProfessional wrestling was also big at the Gardens, where legends such as Ric Flair, Jerry Lawler, Andre the Giant, the Undertaker and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin competed.\n\nThe venue had a thrilling history, but in the early-2000s it all went quiet.\n\nAccording to Louisville Forward, the last concert at the Louisville Gardens was in 2006 when the band My Morning Jacket performed. It eventually shut its doors for good in 2008.\n\nSince then, it's sat vacant for decades and is primarily used for city storage.", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "whas11.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Gardens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville Gardens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Letter_of_Intent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Letter of Intent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Louisville", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Louisville"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Colonels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Colonels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Lawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gloves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gloves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_the_Giant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 the Giant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Undertaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone Cold Steve Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Morning_Jacket", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "My Morning Jacket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.whas11.com/assets/WHAS/images/eafbd071-eacf-41a4-8e39-b26db3a5021c/20240807T201805/eafbd071-eacf-41a4-8e39-b26db3a5021c_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792666", "eventUri": "eng-9792666", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 604}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Center. A start time was not specified.\n\nThis is the fifth iteration of Louisville Live -- and the first at the 22,090-seat arena the Cardinals call home.\n\nPrevious host sites included: Fourth Street Live! (2018-19), Churchill Downs (2021) and Louisville Slugger Field (2022).\n\nThe Yum! Center is due for a large turnout after men's basketball attendance plummeted to an average of 6,504 scanned tickets per game during former head coach Kenny Payne's 12-52 tenure. There were only three crowds of 10,000 or more during his 35 home games at the helm; and one of those included a lot of fans wearing Kentucky blue.\n\nPayne's successor, Pat Kelsey, has rejuvenated the program -- first by overhauling the Cards' roster through the NCAA transfer portal, then by getting all the new faces on the same page to the tune of 52- and 40-point victories during an exhibition tour of the Bahamas. His tenure officially begins Nov. 4 against Morehead State at the Yum! Center.\n\nOn the women's side, Louisville Live will also mark the one-month-out mark for coach Jeff Walz's team as the Cards prepare to open the 2024-25 season against UCLA at the Aflac Oui-Play Event in Paris. Coming off a 24-10 campaign, which ended in a first-round NCAA Tournament loss to Middle Tennessee, Walz assembled what ESPN considers the No. 6 high school recruiting class in the country.\n\nTickets for Louisville Live will go on sale in September, U of L said. Students will be able to attend the event for free.\n\nReach Louisville men's basketball reporter Brooks Holton at bholton@gannett.com and follow him on X at @brooksHolton.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Payne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Payne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Street_Live!", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Street Live!"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC_Yum!_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KFC Yum!

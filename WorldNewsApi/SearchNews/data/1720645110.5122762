The greatest threat of severe weather hovers over the plains eastward of Greeley, but storms are expected to start around noon across Colorado, NWS forecasters said. Large hail of up to two inches in diameter \u2014 approximately golf ball-sized \u2014 and damaging winds of up to 75 mph are the main threats, forecasters said. Tornadoes are possible, but not likely. In the Denver area, winds will reach up to 60 mph, and quarter-sized hail about one inch in diameter could rain down upon the metro area Saturday afternoon, according to a NWS hazardous weather outlook. Despite the on-and-off storms expected through the afternoon, Denver can expect to see a partly sunny day with temperatures reaching 85 degrees, NWS forecasters said. Cloud cover will increase overnight as temperatures fall to 58 degrees. Severe weather will largely wrap up by 8 p.m. Saturday, before picking back up in intensity around noon Sunday, according to NWS meteorologists. Showers and thunderstorms will continue Sunday over the Front Range and areas just east of the mountains, including Denver, the hazardous weather outlook stated. Elsewhere, scattered thunderstorms are expected. Rainy weather will continue through Monday in most of the state, but a drying and warming trend will start Tuesday, NWS forecasters said. By Wednesday, temperatures are expected to be back in the mid to upper-90s across the metro area, bringing new record highs for the year.

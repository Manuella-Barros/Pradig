(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s not often you see the hurdler finishing in the back signing autographs before she heads off the track. In this case, that hurdler was Lolo Jones. Jones, 41, was once one of the main faces of track and field \u2014 with endorsements galore and high expectations to win as she headed into the 2008 Olympics. She tripped on the ninth hurdle in Beijing and finished seventh but left as big of a celebrity as she came. She\u2019s still a fan favorite. On Friday, she was entered in the 100-meter hurdles at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials. Jones finished last in her heat, which wasn\u2019t a big surprise. But she\u2019s moving on to the semifinals. In fact, everyone who made it over the 10 hurdles advanced after two competitors didn\u2019t start. Jones\u2019 time of 14.86 wasn\u2019t particularly speedy \u2014 her best legal time is 12.43 \u2014 but she\u2019s just about six weeks removed from a torn hamstring and hasn\u2019t hurdled much since then. \u201cToradol, the official sponsor of 40 year olds,\u201d joked Jones of the pain medication. Her biggest fear going into the race wasn\u2019t going fast, but being able to finish at all. \u201cI ran a fearful race because I was terrified,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever done in my career \u2014 and I know it sounds insane.\u201d Jones, an Olympian at both the Summer and Winter Games, said politics in her other sport, bobsled, pushed her back into hurdles realm. She was given a huge cheer as she took the track. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long I thought people forgot,\u201d said Jones, whose first Olympic trials was 2004. \u201cIt just means a world for me to like have even people remember or shout my name because I was terrified on that start line.\u201d What was she doing here so far past what many thought was her prime and the end of her career? Just proving she could still compete. \u201cYou sometimes feel your world is over in your 20s if you don\u2019t make a team. I hope to show (young athletes) you can still be in your 40s and be good enough to qualify for the Olympic trials,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI hope someone after me is going to be good enough to throw down in their 40s.\u201d Also making the semifinals was 35-year-old Nia Ali, a silver medalist at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Guaranteed a spot into the semifinals, Ali took a leisurely stroll over the hurdles in a time of 20.38 seconds. Jones hopes to be on the start line for the semis on Saturday \u2014 hamstring willing, of course. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how I feel,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf I wake up and I\u2019m super sore, I might have to pull out. But if we\u2019re good, I\u2019m going to go for it.\u201d ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xvbG8tam9uZXMtb2x5bXBpY3MtYzIwODdiOGQ4MzU3Yjc5YjkzODg0MWNkMGIwYjY5NTjSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Hurdler Lolo Jones returns to Olympic trials at 41, advances to semis on sore hamstring</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/lolo-jones-olympics-c2087b8d8357b79b938841cd0b0b6958", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9a48a02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5689x3200+0+296/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd1%2Fcc%2Fd222c46a7911526280d1c99bfc30%2F3302395c7bcd4283a54962c4e5484e4a", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:44:27", "author": "Pat Graham", "authors": ["Pat Graham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.164}

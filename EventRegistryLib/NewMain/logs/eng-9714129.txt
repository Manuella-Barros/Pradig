During the pandemic she raised money for food banks and the Wales Air Ambulance and brought joy to her community by growing sunflowers and setting up a book exchange on her garden wall.\n\nTheir Majesties will also meet members of Senedd staff who have worked here for 25 years, or are themselves 25 years old, and Welsh Youth Parliament representatives.", "source": {"uri": "wrexham.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrexham.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywydd_of_the_Senedd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Llywydd of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elin_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elin Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_chamber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debate chamber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Right Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_RT_Davies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew RT Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhun_ap_Iorwerth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhun ap Iorwerth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multilingualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceredigion", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceredigion"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ceredigion"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Youth_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Youth Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanelli", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Llanelli"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Llanelli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.wrexham.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CharlesCardiff.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714129", "eventUri": "eng-9714129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The couple were be greeted by children representing schools across Wales before meeting the Llywydd Elin Jones and First Minister Vaughan Gething.\n\nThey also met party and parliamentary leaders and heard a performance by the King's new harpist, Mared Pugh-Evans, in her first performance in the position. Two poems written by Aron Pritchard were be performed - one written when he was a school pupil to mark the official opening of the then National Assembly in 1999 and a new one written for this event. Mr Pritchard is now a member of staff at the Senedd.\n\nDuring his speech the King said he was proud to join MSs in celebrating 25 years of devolution and to see his son William's growing relationship with Wales. Charles said: \"It is a milestone on a journey which it has been my privilege, all my life, to share with you - during times which have seen great change, profound sorrow, and tremendous achievement. Through it all my respect and affection for the people of this ancient land have deepened with every passing year.\"\n\nThe former Prince of Wales added: \"It has given me great pleasure to see my son's relationship with this special land continue including returning only this week to Anglesey - Ynys Mon - a place which I know means so much to him. So it is with countless special memories and particular pride that I am able to join you as we reflect upon the last quarter-century of the history we have shared and which you - in your work in this Senedd - have the great responsibility of making.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cathy_owen@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Cathy Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ruth_mosalski@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Mosalski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywydd_of_the_Senedd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Llywydd of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elin_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elin Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard of honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglesey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglesey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anglesey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29522546.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/35_King_Charles_cardiff_2024JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714129", "eventUri": "eng-9714129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

region.\n\nAddressing the assembly in both Welsh and English, King Charles expressed his appreciation for the Senedd's commitment to using the Welsh language not just symbolically, but as a fundamental part of its operations.\n\n\"It's wonderful to see the Senedd embrace Welsh as a foundation,\" remarked the King, underscoring the significance of linguistic inclusivity.\n\nReflecting on Wales' journey over the past quarter-century, Charles emphasized the Senedd's pivotal role in providing the nation with a \"distinct voice\" characterized by clarity and purpose.\n\nHe described the occasion as a milestone that has shaped Wales throughout his lifetime.\n\nThe King also touched upon Prince William's recent visit to Ynys Mon, noting its personal significance to his son.\n\n\"It's a place that means so much to him,\" King Charles remarked warmly, connecting the royal family's personal ties with the broader Welsh community.\n\nSchoolchildren from various corners of Wales, alongside civic leaders including Senedd's presiding officer Elin Jones and First Minister Vaughan Gething, joined in the ceremonial welcome as King Charles and Queen Camilla entered the Senedd

speech, followed by remarks from First Minister Vaughan Gething and leaders of political parties present.\n\nAmidst the ceremony, the poignant notes of \"Safwn yn y Bwlch\" filled the Senedd chamber, performed by the talented ensemble from Ysgol Treganna.\n\nThe atmosphere was further enriched by the recitation of two evocative poems.\n\nOne, penned by Aron Pritchard of the Senedd staff,

I hope you can feel a real sense of pride in the respect that has been earned and in the contribution that has been made to the lives of so many.\n\n\"Welsh minds have indeed been directed to Welsh matters and the distinct voice of Wales is heard with clarity and purpose.\n\n\"We look back at the journey so far and we look forward to the journey yet to come.\"\n\n'Unique mosaic'\n\nLooking to the Plaid Cymru benches in the Siambr, the Kind said: \"Now, of course, a parliament would not be worthy of the name were there not differences of opinion.\n\n\"But it is a tribute to that spirit of community - so evident to all who love Wales, as we do - that this has been managed with an inclusivity the very shape of this chamber symbolises.\"\n\nHis Majesty described Wales as a \"unique mosaic of places, landscapes and cultures\".\n\nTurning back to Welsh, he said: \"It is wonderful to see that the Senedd uses the Welsh language so often - not just as a symbolic act but as its foundation.\n\n\"The greatest honour is its use.\"\n\nThe 25th anniversary coincides with the passing of a law which will see the Senedd expanded from 60 to 96 members elected under a new voting system from 2026.\n\n'Threatened'\n\nKing Charles said the Senedd has become more than a symbol over the past 25 years: \"It has become essential to the life of Wales.\n\n\"And as we look back ... I offer you heartfelt congratulations on all you have achieved.\n\n\"We now look forward to the tasks that we face in the next quarter century - not least the challenge we all share as inhabitants of this threatened planet.\n\n\"A challenge which I know you are seeking to meet with energy and determination.\n\n\"A great milestone has been reached: there are many more ahead: but you do not travel alone. The strength, resilience and aspiration of the Welsh people will help to sustain you.\n\n\"You take with you the goodwill and support of all who have the interests of Wales at heart - they will be equal to any task.\n\n\"With those interests in mind, I pray that in the years to come you will achieve even more - overcome even more challenges and find even more causes for celebration.\n\n'Pioneering'\n\nElin Jones, the Senedd's speaker or Llywydd, is one of a few remaining members of \"class of '99\" who have served for the full 25 years since the then-National Assembly was set up.\n\nMs Jones said: \"We'd come to build Wales and change the world but, as with life, we were soon deflated by the mundane and sometimes bizarre - nothing more so than our annual scrutiny of the potatoes originating in Egypt regulations.\n\n\"Those early years demonstrated the inadequacy of our powers and the aspiration to do more. The people of Wales in 2011, by referendum, supported granting primary law-making powers to the Senedd.\n\n\"And we have been pioneering and ambitious in the use of those powers.... we've been innovative in how we do our politics, with coalitions, co-operation and joint working.\"\n\nThe speaker quoted Steffan Lewis - her Plaid Cymru colleague who died in 2019 - who urged Senedd members to \"always say what you believe and believe what you say\".\n\nIn closing, Ms Jones said. \"The class of '99 and the class of today will come and go.\n\n\"In our time of service we are merely custodians, as this Senedd is in the permanent and precious ownership of the people of Wales.\"\n\n'Welsh minds'\n\nVaughan Gething told the Senedd 1999 feels like a lifetime ago and he was still a student about to graduate from Aberystwyth University.\n\nWales' first minister said: \"While I was sitting my final exams, another former student of that great Welsh university - another former resident of Pantycelyn hall of residence - was addressing the first National Assembly.\n\n\"Your majesty told members: in the Assembly the voice of Wales will have its authentic and vigorous expression, in ways not possible before Welsh minds will be directed to Welsh matters. Indeed, this was the very aim of devolution then as it is now.\"\n\nMr Gething said devolution has evolved into an established part of the constitutional fabric of the UK over the past quarter of a century.\n\nThe first minister said Queen Elizabeth told the Senedd in 2003 that it is vital to the health - both of the UK and Wales - that democratic institutions flourish and adapt.\n\n'What next'\n\n\"And adapt we have,\" said Mr Gething, pointing to the move to law-making powers and the introduction of the first Welsh taxes in 800 years as examples.\n\nLooking to the future, he said: \"Yma o hyd [still here] is not enough. Beth nesa and what is next must always be our mission.\"\n\nEurope's first black leader told the Siambr part of the challenge is to ensure institutions reflect and represent all the communities of Wales.\n\nHe said: \"As a black person and leader of my country, I know the responsibility I have to open doors for people who look like me to have the same opportunity to serve.\"\n\nIn closing, the former lawyer said: \"As we move to the next chapter in the history of devolution, I hope those of us here today will continue ... to discharge our responsibility to improve the lives that it is our privilege to serve.\n\n'Beating heart'\n\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of Conservative opposition, said the Senedd has grown into a mature and developed parliament that the people of Wales are proud of.\n\nMr Davies told the chamber: \"Ultimately, this institution over the past 25 years, has endeared itself to the fabric and make-up of Wales.\"\n\nHe said: \"It is a huge privilege for me to stand here as leader of the Conservative group.\n\n\"25 years ago I was milking cows - 27 years ago when the referendum took place, I did not vote for the establishment of this place because I was not interested in politics at that time.\n\n\"But I fully agree that this institution, this parliament is now where the beating heart of Welsh democracy lies ... let's develop a democracy here in Wales we can all be proud of.\"\n\n'Electrifying'\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth echoed the King's words on the opening of the National Assembly in 1999: \"This body is the modern expression of the spirit of Wales which has flourished through the centuries like a grand and sturdy tree.\"\n\nThe Plaid Cymru leader, who was a political journalist at the time, described the the spirit of hope and sense of confidence in 1999 as electrifying\n\nMr ap Iorwerth said: \"We must always sow new ideas and harvest change that makes a positive difference and genuine difference to the lives of our citizens.\"\n\n\"In two years' time this will become an even stronger, fairer parliament - more representative and more able to meet our citizens' aspirations for the future.\n\n\"As we look ahead to the next 25 years and beyond, I hope we can all resolve to pursue those aspirations and continue to nurture our Senedd - our democracy - in a way that is truly worthy of the people of Wales.\"", "source": {"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA new law which will mean every voter in Wales will automatically be added to the voting register has been passed by Senedd members. If trials are successful, it will be in place for the 2026 Senedd elections.\n\nThe Elections and Elected Bodies (Wales) Bill is, the Welsh Government say, something which will help increase participation in Welsh council and Senedd elections.\n\nThe law has four main parts:\n\nIntroducing new pilots for the automatic registration of voters for Senedd and local government elections in Wales Setting up a new all-Wales body responsible for co-ordinating the effective administration of Welsh elections Creating a new online voter information platform Introducing measures to increase diversity in the membership of the Senedd and local government.\n\nREAD MORE: Sacked Welsh Government minister accused of leak breaks silence with Senedd statement\n\nREAD MORE: Rhun ap Iorwerth: 'We'll hold Labour's feet to the fire in the Senedd'\n\nIn the final stage of debate before it was passed, Labour's counsel general Mick Antoniw told the chamber that automatic registration \"will have the potential to add the missing 400,000 Welsh electors to the register\". He said in the wider UK it would mean an extra potential 7m voters on the register.\n\nThe Conservatives in the Senedd opposed the bill. Voters will be automatically added to the register by council staff and don't have to initiate the process themselves.\n\nVoters are then contacted to ensure the details are correct and to ensure they are happy to be added to the register and whether they want to register anonymously. The Electoral Reform Society has hailed the passing of the bill as a big step forward for Welsh democracy.\n\nDarren Hughes, chief executive of Electoral Reform Society, said: \"The passing of this bill is a groundbreaking moment for democracy in Wales, as well as the wider United Kingdom. Automatic voter registration is a win-win for voters as it takes one more thing off their to-do list while also strengthening our democracy by helping to enfranchise the hundreds of thousands of missing voters in Wales.\" For the latest politics news in Wales sign up to our newsletter here.\n\nAfter the bill passed, Mr Antoniw said: \"This is a big year for elections, with last week's general election reminding us everyone's vote counts, and by voting we can determine who runs our governments. It is important that every citizen has the opportunity to vote and that means being on the electoral register.\n\n\"According to the Electoral Commission, around 400,000 people are missing from it. This is bad for democracy. Our Bill will seek to automatically register every citizen who is entitled to vote.

They were First Minister Vaughan Gething and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was in the Welsh capital just three days after securing a huge majority in the general election which made him the first Labour Prime Minister since the party - led by Gordon Brown - lost the 2010 election to David Cameron's Conservatives.\n\nThe wonderful footage was captured by Channel 4 News journalist Andy Davies, and has been shared and liked thousand of times on social media.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nReform UK is aiming to win more than 10 seats in the Welsh Parliament at the next election, its leader in Wales Caroline Jones has said.\n\nMs Jones, who previously ran a cafe in Porthcawl and worked as a prison officer at HMP Parc in Bridgend, became a Senedd Member when Ukip won seven seats in the 2016 Senedd election. She said that she believed Reform was on track to win even more seats than Ukip did eight years ago.\n\nAt the general election last week, Reform won 17% of the vote around Wales, only marginally behind the Conservatives on 18% and Ms Jones said she believed the party was on course to win more seats than Ukip had done in 2016. In 13 of Wales' 32 constituencies including Bridgend, Reform came second.\n\nREAD MORE: The general election results in full for every constituency\n\nREAD MORE: The Nigel Farage effect: How Reform UK overnight became one of the biggest forces in Welsh politics\n\nAt the next Senedd election in 2016, there will be a different voting system and an increase in the number of Senedd members from 60 to 96.\n\nMrs Jones said the timing of the Westminster election took them \"on the hop\". She said: \"We had started preparing and all candidates were in situ. Some had never been candidates before but the six weeks did come as a bit of a shock. Obviously we didn't expect it in July, we thought we had more time to prepare and get the leaflets printed but it suddenly became a huge rush, for every party, not just us. We were caught on the hop.\n\n\"Considering that, I think we did remarkably well to get, as a new party, five MPs in. I wished Wales could have had something but we are Labour-entrenched in Wales, it is first past the post and it begs the question why Reform had only five MPs with four million votes and the Lib Dems have 72 MPs with 3.5 million votes. It isn't representing the public.\"\n\nWhen Nigel Farage made a return and announced he would be a candidate in the Essex seat of Clacton, she said that made a difference. She said: \"People absolutely love Nigel, like us all there are people who don't but the majority were just so excited about Nigel coming back\".\n\nIn the 2024 election in Wales, the party's best result was in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, where 23.7% of voters voted for candidate Gareth Thomas - second to Labour's Gerald Jones, the winning candidate. It is the constituency where Nigel Farage attended to launch the party's equivalent of a manifesto.\n\nIn Llanelli, Reform's Gareth Beer won 11,247 votes - only marginally shy of winning Labour candidate Nia Griffith who took 12,751 votes.\n\nMs Jones said: \"To me, that proved Wales is turning a corner. Voting is changing, there's less turnout, there's voter apathy, but that's because it's first past the post, safe seats should not be in existence now. There should be no such thing. People now need a different voting system.\"\n\nIn two years, the Senedd will elect politicians via a different voting system and asked if she was optimistic that would result in Reform candidates being elected she said: \"Absolutely\". She expects it to exceed the seven UKIP secured in 2016. \"I think we'll be working with double figures, we'll be working to be the opposition in that Senedd because that's exactly what it needs, an opposition. Plaid Cymru are not an opposition because as soon as they get elected they join forces with Labour and that, to me, defeats the object of an opposition\".\n\nThe target areas will be the south Wales valleys seats, she says. \"Where there's more of a chance we'll be giving it all we've got, putting all our efforts into the Senedd and hopefully getting double figures\". The landscape is, she said: \"Starting to turn. When people in Wales become more familiar with us, if we start branches and made our presence more prominent then that would stand us in good stead in two years time.\n\n\"One thing I like in Reform is that there's no arguments, no one upmanship, we all work towards the same goal and that's a refreshing change looking around me and looking at the other parties and the way they argue,\" she said, confirming she will stand again. \"I always felt I had unfinished business in the Senedd,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors":

Charles used to be the Prince of Wales, and he used to regularly visit Wales and he even speaks some Welsh. The current PoW does not speak any Welsh, nor does he regularly visit Wales, nor does he have any interest in forging connections with Welsh people.\n\nWell, today's visit to Cardiff was to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Welsh Parliament, Senedd Cymru. Charles made a speech (in English and and some Welsh) and a quiet time was had by all:\n\nSo, here's the question: why didn't the Prince of Wales attend this anniversary event? Don't get me wrong, I understand why they wanted King Charles there, and I'm quite sure that Charles is more warmly received in Cardiff than his heir. But this is exactly the kind of event which Prince William should attend as the Prince of Wales. Meanwhile, William decided that today - of all days - was the moment he should give a big speech on how he can \"end homelessness.\" There are larger questions about whether Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace are actually coordinating their schedules because I don't think they are. BP stepped in back in March and took over the KP clownshow after KP completely bungled everything around Kate's disappearance. But over the past month or so... we've seen that the clowns are back in charge.

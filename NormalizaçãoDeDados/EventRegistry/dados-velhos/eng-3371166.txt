Warrnambool RSL president John Miles said the new addition, expected to cost about $330,000, would be built on land behind the existing stone monument at the end of Liebig Street.\n\nConcept plans have been drawn up by a specialist architect. An interactive touchscreen will be housed under a pagoda-style roof, providing searchable information on those involved in conflicts up to the present day.\n\nWarrnambool's existing memorial makes little reference conflicts beyond the First World War, and unlike names engraved in stone, the computer-based lists can be updated.\n\n\"The new one will cover all conflicts and it can be added to all the time,\" Mr Miles said.\n\n\"It's very significant for Warrnambool.\"\n\nThe RSL is already working to secure funding for the project from government and philanthropic trusts. A community fund-raising campaign will also be launched. The memorial is due for completion in August 2018 to coincide with the centenary of Anzac celebration.\n\nMr Miles said the RSL expected the memorial would become something of a tourist attraction.\n\n\"I think it will be the only one like it. It will be a big draw card for Warrnambool.\"\n\nWarrnambool mayor Kylie Gaston agreed. \"This is going to be one of the most unique memorials in the nation and certainly has great potential to drive tourism,\" she said.\n\n\"We're excited about the plans they've put together, people coming will be able to look at the interactive screen and find information about family members.\n\n\"It's going to be done incredibly professionally and become a point of reference.\"\n\nNew memorial to put faces to the names\n\nA new interactive war memorial planned for Warrnambool will help put faces to the names of thousands of south-west men and women who have served their country.\n\nWarrnambool RSL and the city council have united on the project to create a second memorial that will give proper recognition to servicemen and women post World War I.\n\nThe memorial will feature a touchscreen allowing people to search the names and service records of those involved in conflicts including World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Australia's peace-keeping efforts.\n\nRSL memorabilia officer David McGinness has been given the mammoth task of co-ordinating the collection of names for the project.\n\nUnder the plans, the memorial will provide basic service records and a photo of all those who served.\n\nMr McGinness said being able to put a face to a name would \"speak volumes\".\n\n\"We can go across and see the names on (on the existing memorial), but then you go 'OK, but what did they look like? Who were they? You don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"To build this portfolio up for the memorial, it's a massive task.\"\n\nMr McGinness began about eight months ago. \"I've just completed sifting through our World War II side of things. What started off with about 15,000 names I think it was I've got it down to 7800, that's including women,\" he said.\n\n\"That's people from Warrnambool, born, enlisted and their residential address in Warrnambool and also the Moyne Shire.\"\n\nHistorian James Affleck has gathered the numbers on Korea (45 from Warrnambool) and Vietnam (190), but Mr McGinness said there would still be additions to be made.\n\n\"That's why we need to get it out there to bring the people forward so we can confirm,\" he said.\n\nArchitect and war memorial specialist Max Chester has drawn up plans for the state-of-the-art memorial. A touchscreen will be housed under a pagoda-style structure and 10 bronze plaques will represent the 10 conflicts Australians have been involved in since 1918, including special recognition of women and indigenous involvement.\n\nAt dusk each night a screen of water will come down and a projector will show the Menin Gate at midnight and a silhouette of a bugler will play The Last Post and The Ode will be read.\n\nPlans for the new memorial.\n\n\u200bThe project will cost about $330,000. The state government has contributed $80,000. A grant for $40,000 has been submitted to the federal government. The Warrnambool City Council will contribute $20,000 and provide the administrative and technical co-ordination for the project. The Warrnambool RSL will contribute $20,000. The RSL hopes to source a further $80,000 from local foundations. A fund-raising campaign is hoping to raise about $100,000.\n\nThe project will be officially launched in late October or early November this year.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T07:40:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1801, "textStart": 1790, "date": "2018-08-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3371166", "time": "07:40:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3371166", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "12", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "241", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "65773", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea"}, "country": null}, "score": 2}, {"id": "69668", "label": {"eng": "Warrnambool"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrnambool", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrnambool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "101845", "label": {"eng": "Menenpoort"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menin_Gate", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Menenpoort"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "302872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Computer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "score": 3}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 3}, {"id": "309993", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War I"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "score": 3}, {"id": "311564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "War memorial"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial", "score": 5}, {"id": "312182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "score": 4}, {"id": "844958", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shire of Moyne"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Moyne", "score": 2}], "image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/fdcx/doc6w910cmk9er828okk4q.jpg/r0_192_5184_3121_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "timeCrawl": "07:40:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Plans unveiled for new war memorial", "originalArticle": null}

It has been on our agenda for a long while.\n\n\"One of the other motivations was to offer our customers more services.\n\n\"We will be able to do things we couldn't do in Fairy Street because we were restricted with size.\"\n\nImprovements at the Raglan parade site will include a tyre service, a safety-stop brake tester alignment machine, and an automatic car wash.\n\nMr Callaghan said the move was also instigated by a want to improve amenities and have a better working environment for staff, and manufacturers wanting improved facilities to meet standards.\n\nCallaghan Motors are also adding Mercedes Benz vans to its offerings, which currently include Mercedes Benz, Holden, Mitsubishi and Suzuki. New Era caravans and TJM 4x4 are already open for business at the new site.\n\nMr Callaghan said the city was the regional hub for car sales, with buyers coming from across the south-west, Victoria and even interstate.\n\n\"The general trend across Warrnambool is that there are more buyers coming in from further away than what they did 10, 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nCallaghan Motors place a high importance on training for its 56 employees.\n\n\"We need to keep working on ourselves and evolving. That's our general philosophy,\" Mr Callaghan said.\n\n\"We are always looking at what we can do better.\"\n\nInternet trading boosted\n\nThe explosion of the internet has been a game-changer for many industries.\n\nThe Warrnambool Business Trends Survey asked respondents if they generated sales over the web, with respondents saying the proportion of business sales online grew from 39 per cent in 2011 to 50 per cent in 2017.\n\nCallaghan Motors dealer principal Steve Callaghan said the Warrnambool car dealership fully utilised the web and social media.\n\n\"I think the world has got smaller by the internet.

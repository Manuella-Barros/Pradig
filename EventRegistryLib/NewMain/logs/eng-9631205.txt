The rhythmic pulsing noise is happening inside their body and is related to the vascular system, according to the clinic.\n\nIt can be severely life-disrupting.\n\n\"I've had at least one patient who was so distraught by this that she was (having) suicidal thoughts,\" Shaibani tells TODAY.com.\n\n\"People have trouble doing their jobs because they say the noise is so loud that it's hard to have a telephone conversation.\"\n\nPulsatile tinnitus can sometimes be the symptom of a dangerous condition -- a short circuit between arteries and veins close to the base of the skull, known as an arteriovenous fistula, which can lead to stroke or hemorrhage, Shaibani says.\n\nBut in Pulciani's case, the cause was more benign. She had a narrowing of one of the main veins that take blood out of the brain, likely caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension or high pressure in the head, Shaibani says.\n\nA narrowed vein creates noise in the same way pursed lips create a whistling sound, Shaibani notes. And because blood flows rhythmically, people with this condition hear a whooshing sound in sync with their heartbeat.\n\nPulciani was able to quiet the noise when she pressed on her jugular vein because that stopped the blood flow in the vein, thus stopping the sound.\n\nThat's a good first test when doctors are trying to figure out whether a person has pulsatile tinnitus, Shaibani says.\n\nIn November 2023, Shaibani placed a stent in the narrowed vein in Pulciani's brain to open the blood vessel and take away the noise. There was no skull opening involved during the three-hour surgery -- the stent was delivered through a vein in her groin, then guided with a long flexible tube through her body to the vein in her head.\n\nThe stent also treated the thinning of the bone around her vein, a secondary cause of the noise, by creating a supportive wall for the blood vessel, Shaibani says.\n\nThe results were immediate.\n\n\"Once I fully woke up ... it was literally the most rewarding feeling after 13 months to not hear this noise,\" recalls Pulciani, who is a supervisor for a Northwestern Medicine spine clinic.\n\n\"I told Dr. Shaibani that I feel like he gave me my life back.\"\n\nMore than six months after the surgery, Pulciani says she feels great. She urges people who have the same symptoms to be aware of the difference between regular tinnitus and pulsatile tinnitus. When she was still hearing the noise, she found answers and support in a Facebook group called the \"Whooshers\" for people with pulsatile tinnitus.\n\nShaibani says it's common to occasionally hear a heartbeat sound, especially if you're lying on your left side in bed against two pillows.\n\nBut if you're hearing it every day -- especially a whoosh-whoosh sound, even if it's not necessarily continuous -- it's something to pay attention to, even if it's not that bothersome, because it can signal that dangerous arteriovenous fistula in a minority of cases.\n\n\"Many of the causes of pulsatile tinnitus are treatable, as opposed to regular tinnitus for which we don't always have good treatment,\" Shaibani says.\n\n\"Certainly, if the noise is loud enough that it's really affecting

About 15% report that they are affected on a daily basis by tinnitus, where they hear ringing or other sounds that are not perceived by those around them.\n\nIn one of the largest studies of its kind, researchers from the University of Michigan collected data from more than 160,000 participants who answered a questionnaire and completed a hearing test through the Apple Research app, starting in 2019. The research aims to study the effect of exposure to sounds through headphones, How tinnitus affects people's daily lives and perhaps the development of new methods for managing symptoms.\n\n\"The trends we identify through this process in people's experiences with tinnitus can help us better understand which groups are most at risk, which in turn can help guide mitigation efforts associated with this phenomenon,\" said Rick Nagel, a professor of health sciences at the University of Michigan. In a press release.\n\nTinnitus is a widespread phenomenon, which can affect people's daily lives. About 10% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of tinnitus, according to estimates from the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders (NIDCD).\n\nBut the way people experience tinnitus, which can be caused by exposure to loud noise, may change with the devices people use now. In the past, tinnitus was associated with people working in particularly noisy areas. Over the past decade, listening to music through headphones, attending concerts or sporting events, and other forms of \"recreational\" exposure to noise have become more concerning for researchers. Previous studies agree that for people living in urban environments, listening to music can be the largest source of noise exposure. Apple's iPods, smartphones, and headphones have undoubtedly played a role in this trend.\n\nAs expected, exposure to very high levels of noise was the main cause of tinnitus in participants in the new research. About 10% of people who participated in the Apple-sponsored study reported that tinnitus affects their ability to hear clearly. At the same time, the researchers found that the duration of this episode \"increases dramatically\" over time. Nearly 46% of participants aged 55 or older had persistent tinnitus, compared to 14.7% among all adults. More than half of participants turn to machines that produce other sounds or nature sounds to control tinnitus.\n\nThe study could \"contribute to the development of new products to improve the listening experience and reduce the likelihood of hearing loss,\" the University of Michigan said on its website.

Similarly, after the vaccine rollouts, there was a noticeable uptick in tinnitus cases among vaccinated individuals, particularly those with specific metabolic histories or who experienced reactions post-vaccination,\" Anusha Yellamsetty, audiologist, assistant professor at San Jos\u00e9 State University, and the second author of the study, told The Epoch Times via email.\n\n\"The frequency of tinnitus reports in the VAERS database is higher for COVID-19 than for other vaccines,\" the authors wrote.\n\nIn the Facebook group, 336 respondents were evaluated for shared risk factors. Forty had hypertension, 39 were obese, and 40 had thyroid disorders. The authors thus suggested that metabolic disorders increase a person's risk of tinnitus.\n\nThe survey also revealed a possible link between post-vaccine tinnitus and genes. Thirty-six survey respondents reported that at least one other household member had also developed tinnitus after vaccination.\n\nMs. Yellamsetty, the audiologist, took an interest in post-vaccine tinnitus after developing the condition post-COVID vaccination.\n\n\"General tinnitus cases often present with a more gradual onset compared to the abrupt onset seen in post-vaccine tinnitus,\" she said, adding that post-vaccine tinnitus can be more severe.\n\nThrough the survey, researchers identified one drug that appeared to help with tinnitus: the steroid prednisone. Steroids are often used to relieve tinnitus.\n\nDr. Keith Berkowitz, an internist and medical director at the Center for Balanced Health in New York who was not involved in the study, added that 88 of the 336 participants had allergies, and this risk was unexplored in the article.\n\nA person prone to allergic reactions usually has high levels of histamine. Dr. Berkowitz said he has observed this in patients he has treated who got tinnitus after COVID vaccination. Sometimes, these cases of tinnitus can be alleviated with antihistamines like loratadine and cetirizine. Supplements like quercetin, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and vitamin C can also help reduce histamine.\n\nSteroids have also been prescribed to reduce inflammation from histamine reactions and allergies, though these are not antihistamine drugs.\n\nHowever, since most reports of tinnitus are rapid-onset, appearing immediately or within two days, the study authors speculated that this is too fast to be caused by an overactive immune response to the vaccines.\n\n\"It is likely the vaccine adverse effect was mediated by a more direct pathway,\" the authors wrote, suggesting that spike proteins, viral proteins the body makes after being vaccinated to trigger antibodies, may be causing the damage.\n\n\"Spike proteins have been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, activate microglia/neuroinflammation and cause neuronal death,\" the authors wrote. If this occurs near the ears or in the nerves supplying the ears, it can lead to tinnitus.\n\nFurthermore, spike proteins can aggregate to form plaque proteins, which, in mass, lead to neurodegeneration.\n\n\"These ... inflammation could disrupt blood-brain barrier and other brain function, and potentially lead to tinnitus and other mental health issues,\" the authors wrote.\n\nDr. Berkowitz said that he was pleasantly surprised to see spike protein being considered as a mechanism for post-vaccine injuries. Since all COVID-19 vaccines produce spike proteins in the body, implications of spike proteins being potentially injurious can be controversial.\n\nAnother mechanism he proposed that could cause tinnitus is allergic or histamine reactions.\n\n\"Allergies are so common that a lot of people don't consider it a serious medical risk factor,\" said Dr. Berkowitz.\n\nDr. Berkowitz, who has treated hundreds of long-COVID and post-vaccine patients, said that the study's observations do not reflect what he sees in his clinic.\n\n\"I haven't seen any case of post-COVID tinnitus,\" he said. However, the Canadian paper reported that around 5 percent of people infected with COVID-19 develop tinnitus.\n\nBased on estimations from VAERS, the risk of post-vaccine tinnitus is less than 0.1 percent. If the authors relied on incidence from the survey alone, the risk could reach over 8 percent.\n\n\"The research climate regarding COVID-vaccine adverse events is evolving,\" said Ms. Yellamsetty.\n\n\"Initially, there was significant controversy and sensitivity around discussing adverse events due to the urgent need for widespread vaccination and public health messaging. However, as the pandemic has progressed, there is growing recognition of the importance of understanding and addressing these adverse events.\n\n\"More researchers are now engaging with this topic, aiming to provide comprehensive data to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy while addressing public concerns. This shift towards a more balanced and open approach is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge and maintaining public trust in vaccination programs,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tinnitus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Histamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metabolic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antihistamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acetylcysteine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thyroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biochemistry_and_Molecular_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/03/id5661982-GettyImages-1777374318-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631205", "eventUri": "eng-9631205", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 243247398, "title": "Children given digital devices then they are having tantrums do not learn to regulate emotions, study finds", "text": "According to the study, if parents regularly use digital devices to calm their children, that child could have issues with emotion regulation, which could lead to anger management problems in later life. Children learn a lot about self-regulation \u2013 affective, mental, and behavioural responses to certain situations \u2013 during their first few years of life, and this is mainly done through their relationship with their parents, researchers say. In recent years, it has become more common to give children digital devices to control their responses to emotions, especially if they are negative. But researchers suggest that if people knew digital devices were not appropriate for dealing with tantrums, the mental health and well-being of children would benefit. Dr Veronika Konok, the study\u2019s first author and a researcher at Eotvos Lorand University in Hungary, said: \u201cTantrums cannot be cured by digital devices. \u201cChildren have to learn how to manage their negative emotions for themselves. \u201cThey need the help of their parents during this learning process, not the help of a digital device.\u201d She added: \u201cHere we show that if parents regularly offer a digital device to their child to calm them or to stop a tantrum, the child won\u2019t learn to regulate their emotions. \u201cThis leads to more severe emotion-regulation problems, specifically, anger management problems, later in life.\u201d Senior author, Professor Caroline Fitzpatrick, a researcher at the Universite de Sherbrooke, Canada, added: \u201cWe frequently see that parents use tablets or smart phones to divert the child\u2019s attention when the child is upset. \u201cChildren are fascinated by digital content, so this is an easy way to stop tantrums and it is very effective in the short term. \u201cIf people\u2019s awareness about digital devices being inappropriate tools for curing tantrums increases, children\u2019s mental health and well-being will profit.\u201d In 2020, the researchers conducted an assessment and a followed-up one year later. More than 300 parents of children aged between two and five years old completed a questionnaire that assessed child and parent media use. According to the findings, published in Frontiers in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, when parents used digital emotion regulation more often, children showed poorer anger and frustration management skills a year later.", "summary": "<p>Handing a child a mobile phone or tablet when they throw a tantrum may be damaging their ability to manage their emotions, new research suggests.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/life/family/parenting/children-given-digital-devices-then-they-are-having-tantrums-do-not-learn-to-regulate-emotions-study-finds/a81432198.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/hnKbIz7tgDRhbb_Boyg9kp5J96o=/0x0:5760x3840/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/829a417c-e716-4372-a79a-0af9416c4731/087c7617-e1c7-435e-b3ad-e60300820542/829a417c-e716-4372-a79a-0af9416c4731.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:30:00", "author": "Nina Massey", "authors": ["Nina Massey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.153}

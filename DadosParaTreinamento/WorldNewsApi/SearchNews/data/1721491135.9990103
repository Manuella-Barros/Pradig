The trend has even morphed into a new form of social interaction among the younger generation. One such event that took place on May 25, was called \u201cIf You Are the Cute One,\u201d and attracted significant online attention, Star Video reported. The idea was inspired by the Chinese television dating show, \u201cIf You Are the One,\u201d in which male contestants introduce themselves in video clips, and female guests show their interest by turning the lights on for \u201cyes\u201d and off for \u201cno\u201d. During the pet matchmaking event, a male cat that was described as \u201chaving a car, a house and financial independence\u201d stood out as a desirable candidate as he sought to find a partner. The cat\u2019s dating profile amusingly disclosed that he \u201chas just turned two years old and is successful in his career\u201d. The profile went on to describe the feline as \u201cintroverted, appearing cold on the outside but warm on the inside, sexy and shy, quietly passionate, with a strong physique, and a lover of fitness\u201d. \u201cToday, I am publicly seeking a suitable companion in the feline world, aiming to join paws with a gentle and lovely young cat to nurture a thriving family together,\u201d it said. Four female cats who were attracted to the profile described their family backgrounds, talents and other details. The trend is not the only way the younger generation in China is creating entertainment for themselves while searching for a mate for their pets. Many have also turned to second-hand websites, such as Xianyu, where they post ads for \u201cpet dates.\u201d Owned by Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post, Xianyu has about 3 million people using its platform every year to find partners for their pets and has even created a \u201cPet Matchmaking Corner\u201d to facilitate connections. Ads on the site are often creative and funny, with owners highlighting their pets\u2019 attributes. Some emphasise personalities, such as \u201cadorably silly and honest\u201d while others show photos of their pure breeds, boasting that they have \u201cfur as soft as silk\u201d. The trend has sparked a lively discussion on mainland social media. \u201cHas the pet matchmaking market become so competitive that even male cats must be successful and financially stable?\u201d one online observer joked. \u201cWhether it\u2019s young people or their cats, one of them has to go on a date. It\u2019s better if I\u2019m single, rather than my pet,\u201d said another. \u201cIt seems that young people pressured to marry are passing their stress onto their pets,\u201d wrote a third.", "summary": "China\u2019s young adults are having fun arranging relationships for their domestic animals, partly in an attempt to divert expectations for them to find a partner.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3264502/date-my-cat-china-youth-host-matchmaking-events-pets-relieve-stress-pressure-get-married", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/29/f83f4eb3-9d98-4b64-a34c-95e25797bcfa_0fc92e09.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:12:39", "author": "Yating Yang", "authors": ["Yating Yang"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.532}

Most said they were not aware the synod was meeting.\n\nBut many Romanians are increasingly demanding more accountability from the powerful Orthodox Church to which more than 85 percent of Romanians belong. It has been criticized for the generous subsidies it receives from the state and for being exempt from some taxes.\n\nPublic furor over the bishop and another scandal involving a priest who had sex with a male student has been more marked as it involves homosexual acts. The church, however, insists the bishop would have been similarly rebuked if the alleged sexual misdemeanors involved a woman.\n\nStelian Tanase, a commentator, did not agree. \"Society is still not accepting of homosexuality,\" he said. \"And the church has been losing popularity in recent years,\" for various reasons, \"so it needs to take action.\"\n\nChurch spokesman Vasile Banescu told The Associated Press: \"The message is that you should not be ordained if your moral behavior does not meet church standards.\" He said the church would be stricter in the future over monks that broke the vow of chastity.

The session was confidential, however, and all members were asked to leave their mobile phones and all recording devices at the entrance.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of the Romanian Orthodox Church that a senior cleric is on trial in the Synod for such a moral and disciplinary transgression,\" Banescu noted on Thursday.\n\nHe also said that he had advised the bishop to resign, so the scandal would not damage the image of the entire Church, but the prelate had refused.\n\nIn another case, Cristian Pomohaci, a priest in a village in Mures County, in Transylvania, was recorded trying to convince a 17-year-old boy to have sexual intercourse. The priest is under investigation by the Prosecutor's office. He has been unfrocked already despite having denied the accusations.\n\nThe same priest was involved in 2013 in an exorcism, a practice the Romanian Orthodox Church bans. Then, a Church discipline commission sent him to a monastery to pray and repent.\n\nThe abbot of a monastery in the northern region of Maramures has meanwhile been accused by a theology student of trying to seduce him.

Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims. Meanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County got their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged.

Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control. In Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans also were choosing between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen. The primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Gallego ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate. Accepting victory Tuesday night, Lake called Trump a \"hero\"\u009d and urged his supporters to back her as well. \"He can't do this alone,\"\u009d Lake said. \"He needs backup in Washington, D.C. And I'm going to be his backup.\"\u009d The once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\"\u009d movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat. Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million. Lake faces Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it. Lake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate. \"Go vote,\"\u009d Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\u009d She defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her. This time, Lake made gestures toward unity, inviting people who didn't vote for her to join her. She said she will need \"people from all walks of life\" and told \"traditional Republicans\"\u009d from the GOP establishment that \"we love you.\" But she also framed the general election as \"a battle between good and evil\"\u009d and between \"the people who want to destroy this country and the people who want to save America.\"\u009d Gallego, she said, \"is an extreme liberal Democrat from Chicago\" who is aligned with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Since launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\"\u009d but later spoke favorably for it. She has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims. Meanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County got their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement. Those races were too early to call. The feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud. \"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\"\u009d said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix. Republicans also had an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy. On the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area. The winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties. Two Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego. ___ Associated Press writer Anita Snow in Sun City West, Arizona, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of

Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans also were choosing between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's unproven claims about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nGallego ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nLake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nLake faces Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, D.C.,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her contentions.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County got their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also faced challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement. Those races were too early to call.\n\nRepublicans also had an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted in connection with Trump's fake-elector scheme was also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Anita Snow of The

Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat-turned-independent who is not seeking a second six-year term in the Senate.\n\nKari Lake, the front-runner for the Republican Senate nomination, on the eve of the primary teamed up with former President Trump for a tele-rally.

Three of those seats are in red states Trump easily carried in 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nFive other seats are in key swing states narrowly carried by President Biden in 2020: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the race for the House, the GOP holds a fragile majority in the chamber. And in Arizona, Democrats are aiming to unseat two vulnerable Republican incumbents in districts Biden carried four years ago.\n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of northeast Phoenix and surrounding suburbs, seven-term GOP incumbent Rep. David Schweikert is the front-runner in a field of primary rivals that includes businessman Robert Backie and former FBI agent and corporate investigator Kim George.\n\nThere's a crowded field of Democrats vying for their party's nomination.\n\nIn the southeastern part of the state, Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani is running for a second term in a district that includes much of suburban Tucson.\n\nHe's facing off on Tuesday in a GOP primary that includes challenger Kathleen Winn, who came in third in the 2022 nomination race.\n\nIf Ciscomani wins the primary as expected, he'll face off in November against Democrat Kisten Engel in a rematch of their extremely close 2022 election showdown.\n\nMeanwhile, in the red-leaning 8th Congressional District, Trump has endorsed both major candidates in the Republican primary, Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh, who ran unsuccessfully for

(KGUN) -- PHOENIX (AP) -- Kari Lake is looking defeat opponent Sheriff Mark Lamb in the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nMark Lamb: What to expect in Arizona's state primaries\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nLake's GOP primary opponent is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who says he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he has struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nThe winner will face Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nGallego is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary.\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nThe feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\" said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\n___\n\nBy JONATHAN J. COOPER Associated Press.

Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nGallego is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nHer GOP primary opponent is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who says he's more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he's struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nThe winner will face Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_j_cooper@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Jonathan J.

And in Arizona, Democrats are aiming to unseat two vulnerable Republican incumbents in districts Biden carried four years ago.\n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, which includes parts of northeast Phoenix and surrounding suburbs, seven-term GOP incumbent Rep.

Ruben Gallego, who is running uncontested in his primary, will officially learn his general election opponent -- though he and GOP front-runner Kari Lake have been sparring for months under the assumption she will be her party's nominee.\n\nLake, who has been endorsed by Donald Trump, has steadfastly refused to mention her nearest Republican rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, on the stump. When she was questioned about whether she would be open to debating Lamb in March, Lake said: \"I am focusing on the general election. We feel very confident in what those poll numbers look like.\"\n\nThe closest the two came to a formal debate was on May 23, when Lake and Lamb both participated in a virtual forum and Lake, an election denier, ripped on him for not sharing her unfounded theories.\n\n\"He's a total coward when it comes to election integrity,\" Lake said of Lamb's refusal to reject the results of the election in 2020, when Joe Biden defeated Trump in Arizona and nationally.\n\n\"I don't think Joe Biden got 81 million votes,\" Lamb said at the forum. \"But I don't live in the world of feelings and thoughts. I live in the world of evidence, what you can prove in court beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nWhile Lake is the heavy favorite in the primary, having outraised Lamb and snagged big-name endorsements from Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Vivek Ramaswamy and more, some in the Arizona Republican establishment have expressed skepticism that her firebrand style will be successful in a general election. She narrowly lost the governor's race in 2022.\n\nRepublican former Gov. Jan Brewer was complimentary of Lamb in an interview with KSAZ-TV of Phoenix this summer. Talking about Lake, Brewer had less favorable things to say: \"There's a lot of people that are unhappy with her. They don't think that she is a truth teller and that she has changed her opinion on certain things. She goes to different rallies, she says different things to different audiences.\"\n\nLooking ahead to November, Gallego launched his Latino campaign coalition, Juntos con Gallego, on Monday. Speaking afterward, he agreed to debate Lake should she clinch the GOP primary.\n\n\"Unlike her, where she didn't debate her opponent, we will gladly debate Kari Lake,\" he said.\n\nWhile Lake refuses to utter Lamb's name, she has choice words for Gallego at every campaign stop, rotating insults from \"swamp rat\" to \"deadbeat.\"\n\nA battle over who's more loved by Trump\n\nOne of the most closely watched GOP primaries of the election features a battle between a pair of Trump acolytes who have both made him the most prominent feature of their campaigns in the 8th Congressional District.\n\nBlake Masters, a financier who lost his 2022 Senate bid, and Abraham Hamadeh, who lost his 2022 race for state attorney general by just 280 votes (and has made unfounded claims that the race was stolen a centerpiece of his current campaign), are the front-runners in a race crowded with several other well-known Republicans. Also running are state House Speaker Ben Toma; former Rep. Trent Franks, who served in Congress for 16 years before he abruptly resigned in 2017, acknowledging at the time that he discussed surrogacy with two former female staffers; and state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was among 18 Trump aides and allies whom an Arizona grand jury indicted in April for their roles in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.\n\nHamadeh and Masters have been duking it out over who remains closer to Trump. Hamadeh won Trump's endorsement in December, though Masters had for months touted that he had won Trump's backing during his failed 2022 Senate bid. In an unusual move, Trump recast his endorsement in this year's primary to throw support to both of them. Masters, like Vance, won major financial support from tech billionaire Peter Thiel in 2022.\n\nThe 8th District -- in the northwest valley of the metropolitan Phoenix area with an older, retired population and a large chunk of evangelical Christians -- is solidly Republican. Tuesday's winner is all but certain to defeat likely Democratic nominee Greg Whitten in November.\n\nTwo of the closest House battlegrounds in the country\n\nFormer state Sen. Kirsten Engel is running uncontested in the Democratic primary in the swing 6th District, which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson.\n\nThe race for the seat -- currently held by Republican Juan Ciscomani, who is in his first term -- is considered a toss-up by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. It is one of two toss-ups in Arizona, which could help decide control of the tightly divided House.\n\nThe match-up would be a repeat of the race in 2022, when Ciscomani defeated Engel by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. David Schweikert is a heavy favorite in his primary against lesser-known and lesser-funded candidates in the 1st District. But across the aisle, the Democratic primary is tight, with six candidates in contention.\n\nLocked in battle for the Democratic nomination for the seat Schweikert barely held in 2022 are Andrei Cherny, a businessman and former chair of the Arizona Democratic Party who previously ran for Congress; Amish Shah, a former member of the state House; Conor O'Callaghan, a businessman; Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former television news broadcaster; Kurt Kroemer, a former Red Cross regional CEO; and Andrew Horne, a photographer and orthodontist.\n\nAs the only woman in her party's primary, Gal\u00e1n-Woods is emblematic of a larger trend in congressional politics. The Rutgers University-based Center for American Women and Politics, the pre-eminent organization tracking the topic, found fewer women are running as major-party candidates for the House this year.\n\nThe race to succeed Gallego\n\nArizona's 3rd District, currently represented by Gallego, has a rich Latino history: The area sent Arizona's first Latino member of Congress, Ed Pastor, to Washington before Gallego continued that legacy, and now former state Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n hopes to extend it.\n\n\"We are making the case that we need to make sure that we have our voices heard in Congress,\" Ter\u00e1n said in an interview Friday.\n\n\"Of course, this is a Democratic primary, and we welcome healthy competition. But what we don't welcome is that Republican investors, donors that have bankrolled Donald Trump, are meddling in a Democratic primary,\" Ter\u00e1n added, swiping at her primary opponent, Yassamin Ansari.\n\nAnsari, a former Phoenix City Council member, has been backed by $1.3 million from the Protect Progress PAC, which has spent money backing Democratic candidates around the country -- but whose cryptocurrency industry funders are also supporting Trump. In an interview with NBC affiliate KPNX of Phoenix, Ansari distanced herself from the donors.\n\n\"I'm not sure what they want,\" Ansari told KPNX's Brahm Resnick of her PAC supporters. \"I ran for office because I hate Donald Trump. I cannot stand MAGA extremism.\"\n\nA big election about elections\n\nIn most counties, and in a previous time, the race for county recorder would not typically generate a whole lot of hoopla. Maricopa County is not most counties.\n\nStephen Richer, one of the most outspoken Republican defenders of election processes in the country, is simultaneously fighting to keep his job while preparing to manage the vote this fall in Maricopa, the largest county in battleground Arizona.\n\nThe Maricopa County recorder's administrative role is vast, including processing deeds and overseeing the voter file and other parts of elections. Since 2020, that is what has captured the most attention.\n\nAfter ballot printers and vote tabulation machines malfunctioned during Arizona's 2022 election, baseless claims of malicious activity arose, and conspiracy theories about Richer, fueled by Lake, resulted in Richer's facing death threats.\n\nRicher has continued to face a slew of attacks to this day. Last month, he posted a video on X of Shelby Busch, the chair of Arizona's delegation to the Republican National Convention this month, saying she would \"lynch\" him if she had the chance. The video stemmed from a livestreamed event on Rumble, a conservative video platform, in Mesa on March 20.\n\nRicher's main primary challenger is state Rep. Justin Heap, who has dodged questions about whether the 2020 election was fraudulent. But he has been endorsed by many of Arizona's most prominent election deniers, including Lake.\n\nDon Hiatt, a long-shot candidate who worked in information management technology, has more explicitly sown doubt about the 2020 election.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_edelman@aol.com", "name": "Adam Edelman", "type": "author",

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Kari Lake is looking to win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nGallego is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary.\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nHer GOP primary opponent is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who says he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he has struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nThe winner will face Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nThe feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\" said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Anita Snow in Sun City West, Arizona, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's

Please try again later.\n\nVoters in Arizona will cast their ballots in a slate of primary elections Tuesday, including a Republican primary for what will be a hotly contested Senate seat that could help determine which party controls the chamber next year.\n\nPerhaps the most closely watched primary in the state will be the race for the Republican nomination to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who left the Democratic Party in 2022 and announced earlier this year that she would not seek reelection to a second term. The winner of the GOP primary will advance to the general election to face Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who is uncontested in the Democratic primary.\n\nThere are also competitive primaries for two of the state's largest congressional districts, including one that Democrats see as an opportunity to flip a House seat and another that will pit two top allies of former president Donald Trump against one another.\n\nArizona Senate Republican primary\n\nFormer television anchor Kari Lake, who ran for Arizona governor and lost in 2022, is considered the front-runner in the GOP primary race for Senate that also includes Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and Elizabeth Reye, a neuroscientist who has positioned herself as a \"Reagan Republican.\" Trump has endorsed Lake, who has echoed Trump's false claims that widespread voter fraud cost them their elections.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary will advance to the general election to face Gallego, who has been running ads attacking Lake as his presumptive opponent nearly since he launched his campaign.\n\nThe GOP primary has polarized Republicans in the state, who remain divided between those who are staunch supporters of Trump and those who consider themselves more in the mold of the late Arizona senator John McCain, a conservative who also rejected Trumpism.\n\nFor instance, Randy Kendrick -- a conservative activist who is one of Arizona's top GOP donors and is married to the owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks -- recently sent an email to her entire \"Christmas card list\" telling people that Lake \"cannot win the general election\" in Arizona and urging them to vote for Lamb instead. Lake lost the 2022 gubernatorial race to now-Gov. Katie Hobbs (D).\n\nArizona 1st District Democratic primary\n\nA crowded field of Democrats is competing to take on incumbent Rep. David Schweikert (R) in what is likely to be the state's most competitive race in November. Arizona's 1st Congressional District is sprawling, covering much of northeastern Phoenix as well as the wealthy suburbs of Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, Cave Creek and Fountain Hills.\n\nThe half-dozen Democratic candidates vying for the party's nomination include business executive Andrei Cherny, former television anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, orthodontist Andrew Horne, business executive Kurt Kroemer, lawyer Conor O'Callaghan and former state representative Amish Shah. No clear front-runners have emerged.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will advance to the general election to face Schweikert, who has served in the House for 25 years. He was first elected to Congress in 2010, and he has won reelection -- in various redrawn districts -- several times since, though his margins of victory have decreased over the years. Schweikert narrowly won reelection in 2022 by less than one percentage point, and Democrats have targeted his seat as a possible pickup.\n\nArizona 8th District Republican primary\n\nA half-dozen Republican candidates are competing in the GOP primary to replace Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.), who announced in October that she would not seek reelection after the end of her term. Arizona's massive 8th Congressional District covers much of north Glendale and the West Valley suburbs of Peoria, Sun City and Sun City West, and stretches all the way north to Lake Pleasant and New River.\n\nFront-runners for the GOP primary include several prominent figures in the state party: former Senate candidate Blake Masters and former state attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh -- both of whom lost their respective races in 2022 to their Democratic opponents. In an unusual circumstance, both also have the support of Trump, who hedged his bets with a last-minute dual endorsement.\n\n\"They will both be spectacular, and I'm pleased to announce that both Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh have my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona's 8th Congressional District -- THEY WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!\" Trump wrote Sunday in a post on his social media platform.\n\nAlso running in the GOP primary are Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, former congressman Trent Franks -- who previously represented this district -- and Arizona state senator Anthony Kern.\n\nYvonne Wingett Sanchez contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She arrived at her polling location in Paradise Valley earlier Tuesday in a new tour bus that featured a giant decal of her with Trump and the words \"Endorsed by President Trump.\"\n\n\"Knowing that I'm Trump-endorsed is important to a lot of people here in Arizona,\" Lake said.\n\nLake's challenge will now take her MAGA-themed message to a broader electorate in a critical swing state for both the race for the White House and control of the Senate. Democrats hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nGallego, 44, once a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has played up his willingness to work across the aisle as he seeks statewide office.\n\n\"In the 554 days since we launched this campaign, Arizonans in every corner of the state have made clear that they want a U.S. Senator who can bring people together to defend abortion rights, cut costs for families, protect our water future, and take care of our veterans -- and that's exactly what I intend to do,\" Gallego said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nGallego enters the general election stage of the race with a cash advantage: He had $8.2 million in his campaign account compared to $2.1 million for Lake as of July 10.\n\nArizona also hosted notable House primaries, several of which remained uncalled late Tuesday night.\n\nFreshman GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani fended off a primary challenger in the swing 6th District, setting up a rematch with former state Sen. Kirsten Engel, a Democrat.\n\nEngel, who ran uncontested in Tuesday's Democratic primary, lost to Ciscomani two years ago by less than 2 percentage points. The race for the seat -- which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson -- is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.\n\nIn another battleground, the 6th District, a crowded field of Democrats were vying to take on GOP Rep. David Schweikert.\n\nIn the 8th District, former Maricopa County prosecutor Abe Hamadeh, financier Blake Masters and state House Speaker Ben Toma were locked in a tight race for the Republican primary.\n\nHamadeh and Masters, 2020 election deniers who both ran unsuccessfully for statewide office two years ago, both had support from Trump. The winner of the primary will be a heavy favorite in the general election to replace retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko.\n\nAnd in the 3rd District, the seat Gallego is vacating to run for Senate, former Phoenix City Council member Yassamin Ansari and former state Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were battling in the Democratic primary.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who has forcefully pushed back against unfounded election fraud claims, was in a close race with state Rep. Justin Heap. The outcome could have a major impact on how elections are administered in the country's largest battleground county.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nLake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nLake faces Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County got their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement. Those races were too early to call.\n\nThe feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\" said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix.\n\nRepublicans also had an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Anita Snow in Sun City West, Arizona, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, D.C.,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she had previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's allegations the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democrat side, voters will decide two hotly contested House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democrat district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democrat nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_j_cooper@newsmax.com", "name": "Jonathan J.

Headlining the election is former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake who faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m.\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer faces a challenge from fellow Republicans state Rep. Justin Heap and information technology professional Donald Hiatt in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state\u00b4s most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nFILE - Then-Republican candidate for Arizona Attorney General, Abraham Hamadeh, smiles prior to a televised debate against Democrat Kris Mayes on Sept. 28, 2022. In a Truth Social post on Saturday night, 27, 2024, former President Donald Trump backed candidates Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters - former political allies turned bitter rivals - to represent Arizona's conservative-leaning 8th Congressional District, praising the pair of Republicans as \"two spectacular America First Candidates.\" (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File)\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor\u00b4s race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don\u00b4t have faith in the county\u00b4s election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race\u00b4s lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nSeveral members of the county\u00b4s governing board also face challengers aligned with Trump.\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert is looking to keep it, but his reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Democrats looking to unseat him include Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair who once ran for state treasurer; ex-local news anchor Marlene Galan-Woods; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; investment banker Conor O\u00b4Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert is considered the front-runner, with challenges from businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. The winner between ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n is a favorite to win overall and represent the district spanning central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post.\n\nJesus David Mendoza and Jeff Zink are seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time in Tuesday's election. She's facing small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans farther to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook is challenging incumbent Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents the Flagstaff region and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett is facing a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a lawyer and real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nFILE - Then- Republican Senate challenger Blake Masters smiles on stage prior to a televised debate with Arizona Democratic Sen.

Ruben Gallego, who is running uncontested in his primary, will officially learn his general election opponent -- though he and GOP front-runner Kari Lake have been sparring for months under the assumption she will be her party's nominee.\n\nLake, who has been endorsed by Donald Trump, has steadfastly refused to mention her nearest Republican rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, on the stump. When she was questioned about whether she would be open to debating Lamb in March, Lake said: \"I am focusing on the general election. We feel very confident in what those poll numbers look like.\"\n\nThe closest the two came to a formal debate was on May 23, when Lake and Lamb both participated in a virtual forum and Lake, an election denier, ripped on him for not sharing her unfounded theories.\n\n\"He's a total coward when it comes to election integrity,\" Lake said of Lamb's refusal to reject the results of the election in 2020, when Joe Biden defeated Trump in Arizona and nationally.\n\n\"I don't think Joe Biden got 81 million votes,\" Lamb said at the forum. \"But I don't live in the world of feelings and thoughts. I live in the world of evidence, what you can prove in court beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nWhile Lake is the heavy favorite in the primary, having outraised Lamb and snagged big-name endorsements from Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Vivek Ramaswamy and more, some in the Arizona Republican establishment have expressed skepticism that her firebrand style will be successful in a general election. She narrowly lost the governor's race in 2022.\n\nRepublican former Gov. Jan Brewer was complimentary of Lamb in an interview with KSAZ-TV of Phoenix this summer. Talking about Lake, Brewer had less favorable things to say: \"There's a lot of people that are unhappy with her. They don't think that she is a truth teller and that she has changed her opinion on certain things. She goes to different rallies, she says different things to different audiences.\"\n\nLooking ahead to November, Gallego launched his Latino campaign coalition, Juntos con Gallego, on Monday. Speaking afterward, he agreed to debate Lake should she clinch the GOP primary.\n\n\"Unlike her, where she didn't debate her opponent, we will gladly debate Kari Lake,\" he said.\n\nWhile Lake refuses to utter Lamb's name, she has choice words for Gallego at every campaign stop, rotating insults from \"swamp rat\" to \"deadbeat.\"\n\nOne of the most closely watched GOP primaries of the election features a battle between a pair of Trump acolytes who have both made him the most prominent feature of their campaigns in the 8th Congressional District.\n\nBlake Masters, a financier who lost his 2022 Senate bid, and Abraham Hamadeh, who lost his 2022 race for state attorney general by just 280 votes (and has made unfounded claims that the race was stolen a centerpiece of his current campaign), are the front-runners in a race crowded with several other well-known Republicans. Also running are state House Speaker Ben Toma; former Rep. Trent Franks, who served in Congress for 16 years before he abruptly resigned in 2017, acknowledging at the time that he discussed surrogacy with two former female staffers; and state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was among 18 Trump aides and allies whom an Arizona grand jury indicted in April for their roles in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.\n\nHamadeh and Masters have been duking it out over who remains closer to Trump. Hamadeh won Trump's endorsement in December, though Masters had for months touted that he had won Trump's backing during his failed 2022 Senate bid. In an unusual move, Trump recast his endorsement in this year's primary to throw support to both of them. Masters, like Vance, won major financial support from tech billionaire Peter Thiel in 2022.\n\nThe 8th District -- in the northwest valley of the metropolitan Phoenix area with an older, retired population and a large chunk of evangelical Christians -- is solidly Republican. Tuesday's winner is all but certain to defeat likely Democratic nominee Greg Whitten in November.\n\nFormer state Sen. Kirsten Engel is running uncontested in the Democratic primary in the swing 6th District, which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson.\n\nThe race for the seat -- currently held by Republican Juan Ciscomani, who is in his first term -- is considered a toss-up by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. It is one of two toss-ups in Arizona, which could help decide control of the tightly divided House.\n\nThe match-up would be a repeat of the race in 2022, when Ciscomani defeated Engel by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. David Schweikert is a heavy favorite in his primary against lesser-known and lesser-funded candidates in the 1st District. But across the aisle, the Democratic primary is tight, with six candidates in contention.\n\nLocked in battle for the Democratic nomination for the seat Schweikert barely held in 2022 are Andrei Cherny, a businessman and former chair of the Arizona Democratic Party who previously ran for Congress; Amish Shah, a former member of the state House; Conor O'Callaghan, a businessman; Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former television news broadcaster; Kurt Kroemer, a former Red Cross regional CEO; and Andrew Horne, a photographer and orthodontist.\n\nAs the only woman in her party's primary, Gal\u00e1n-Woods is emblematic of a larger trend in congressional politics. The Rutgers University-based Center for American Women and Politics, the pre-eminent organization tracking the topic, found fewer women are running as major-party candidates for the House this year.\n\nArizona's 3rd District, currently represented by Gallego, has a rich Latino history: The area sent Arizona's first Latino member of Congress, Ed Pastor, to Washington before Gallego continued that legacy, and now former state Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n hopes to extend it.\n\n\"We are making the case that we need to make sure that we have our voices heard in Congress,\" Ter\u00e1n said in an interview Friday.\n\n\"Of course, this is a Democratic primary, and we welcome healthy competition. But what we don't welcome is that Republican investors, donors that have bankrolled Donald Trump, are meddling in a Democratic primary,\" Ter\u00e1n added, swiping at her primary opponent, Yassamin Ansari.\n\nAnsari, a former Phoenix City Council member, has been backed by $1.3 million from the Protect Progress PAC, which has spent money backing Democratic candidates around the country -- but whose cryptocurrency industry funders are also supporting Trump. In an interview with NBC affiliate KPNX of Phoenix, Ansari distanced herself from the donors.\n\n\"I'm not sure what they want,\" Ansari told KPNX's Brahm Resnick of her PAC supporters. \"I ran for office because I hate Donald Trump. I cannot stand MAGA extremism.\"\n\nIn most counties, and in a previous time, the race for county recorder would not typically generate a whole lot of hoopla. Maricopa County is not most counties.\n\nStephen Richer, one of the most outspoken Republican defenders of election processes in the country, is simultaneously fighting to keep his job while preparing to manage the vote this fall in Maricopa, the largest county in battleground Arizona.\n\nThe Maricopa County recorder's administrative role is vast, including processing deeds and overseeing the voter file and other parts of elections. Since 2020, that is what has captured the most attention.\n\nAfter ballot printers and vote tabulation machines malfunctioned during Arizona's 2022 election, baseless claims of malicious activity arose, and conspiracy theories about Richer, fueled by Lake, resulted in Richer's facing death threats.\n\nRicher has continued to face a slew of attacks to this day. Last month, he posted a video on X of Shelby Busch, the chair of Arizona's delegation to the Republican National Convention this month, saying she would \"lynch\" him if she had the chance. The video stemmed from a livestreamed event on Rumble, a conservative video platform, in Mesa on March 20.\n\nRicher's main primary challenger is state Rep. Justin Heap, who has dodged questions about whether the 2020 election was fraudulent. But he has been endorsed by many of Arizona's most prominent election deniers, including Lake.\n\nDon Hiatt, a long-shot candidate who worked in information management technology, has more explicitly sown doubt about the 2020 election.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Masters",

When Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat who left the party in 2022, officially decided in March not to run for re-election, the Democratic side of the race was set.\n\nOn the Republican side, Kari Lake is expected to emerge from a primary race against Mark Lamb, the Pinal County sheriff. Ms. Lake became a Republican star during her unsuccessful bid for governor two years ago, when she embraced former President Donald J. Trump and championed his lies about a stolen election in 2020.\n\nMs. Lake's scorched-earth governor's campaign divided Republicans in Arizona, and she is still working to mend fences within the party. But she is favored to defeat Sheriff Lamb, a right-wing candidate who has made tougher border restrictions a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nTwo of Democrats' top pickup opportunities as they try to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives are in Arizona. The matchup in the Sixth Congressional District, in Tucson, is all but set, with Kirsten Engel running unopposed in the Democratic primary to challenge Representative Juan Ciscomani, a Republican, in November. Mr. Ciscomani has a long-shot challenger, Kathleen Winn, who is running to his right.\n\nBut the Democratic primary in the First Congressional District, in the Scottsdale area, is crowded, with a host of candidates vying to face Representative David Schweikert, a Republican. Voters on Tuesday will decide which of the top contenders to back: Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair; Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former broadcast journalist; Conor O'Callaghan, an investment banker; or former State Representative Amish Shah.\n\nStephen Richer, the high-profile Maricopa County recorder who oversees elections in Arizona's most populous county, has faced years of vitriol from those propagating Mr. Trump's election fraud claims. (He is working through a defamation case against Ms. Lake over her statements about him.) On Tuesday, more conservative Republicans will try to deny him re-election.\n\nJustin Heap, his most prominent opponent, has declined to say if he believes Arizona's elections in 2020 and 2022 were fair. Don Hiatt, the other candidate, says they were not. Mr. Richer's re-election bid was complicated last month when he said he planned to vote for President Biden, who has since dropped out of the 2024 election.\n\nArizona's Third Congressional District, which is being vacated by Mr. Gallego, is solidly blue. And the state's Eighth Congressional District, home to Representative Debbie Lesko, who is retiring, is safely red. But there are bitter primary fights in both races.\n\nOn the Democratic side in the Third District, a former state senator and party chair, Raquel Ter\u00e1n, faces Yassamin Ansari, a former vice mayor of Phoenix. In recent weeks, outside spending from pro-cryptocurrency political action committees has flooded the race on behalf of Ms. Ansari, prompting Ms. Ter\u00e1n's campaign to cry foul.\n\nOne group, Protect Progress, spent more than $1.3 million to help Ms. Ansari, and Ms. Ter\u00e1n noted that some of the group's donors included technology executives who are backing Mr. Trump. It has put Ms. Ansari in an awkward position.\n\nIn the Eighth District, a former U.S. Senate candidate, Blake Masters, and a former attorney general candidate, Abe Hamadeh, have traded barbs for months. In a bizarre twist, Mr. Trump, who endorsed Mr. Hamadeh long ago, issued a new, last-minute endorsement of both candidates over the weekend.

Ruben Gallego.\n\nLake, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, was ahead of Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb 53% to 41% with 77% of the vote in. Former news anchor Elizabeth Reye was running in a distant third.\n\nLake advances to the general election for the seat being vacated by Sen. Krysten Synema, I-Ariz, against Gallego, a Phoenix-area congressman and Marine veteran who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. The race in battleground Arizona will be among a handful that determine partisan control of the Senate this fall.\n\nLake, a 54-year-old former newscaster, first emerged on the political scene during her unsuccessful run for governor in 2022 as a prominent promoter of Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. She later refused to accept her own loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs, who is now Arizona's governor.\n\nLake has heavily touted the former president's endorsement again during her Senate campaign. She arrived to her polling location in Paradise Valley, Ariz., on Tuesday in a new tour bus that featured a giant decal of her with the former president and the words \"Endorsed by President Trump.\"\n\n\"Knowing that I'm Trump-endorsed is important to a lot of people here in Arizona,\" Lake said.\n\nLake's challenge will now be taking her MAGA-themed message to a broader electorate in a critical swing state for both the race for the White House and control of the Senate. Democrats currently hold a 51-49 majority in the upper chamber.\n\nGallego, 44, enters the general election stage of the race with a cash advantage: He had $8.2 million in his campaign account compared to just over $2 million for Lake as of July 10.\n\nArizona also hosted some notable House primaries on Tuesday.\n\nFormer state Sen. Kirsten Engel, a Democrat, advanced to the general election in the swing 6th District, setting up a rematch with GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani.\n\nEngel, who ran uncontested in Tuesday's Democratic primary, lost two years earlier to Ciscomani, who is in his first term, by less than two percentage points. The race for the seat -- which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson -- is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.", "source": {"uri":

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nJuly 30 will see key primaries in the western U.S. states of Arizona and Alaska -- two hot and cold temperature gauges for November's presidential election.\n\nSome races will decide the candidates in key swing districts, while others will pit well-known Republicans against each other.\n\nIt all sets the stage for November, when Republicans defend their narrow House majority and Democrats attempt to maintain their tenuous hold on the Senate.\n\nAs a presidential battleground state, Arizona's down-ballot races will likely be a magnet for media attention and money. Meanwhile, although the presidential contest is not likely to be as competitive in heavily Republican Alaska, a House race will test a Democratic incumbent's durability.\n\nHere's a preview of the most notable contests.\n\nOn the Republican side, MAGA favorite Kari Lake is seeking the nomination for U.S. Senate. Lake is competing with Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is running unchallenged for his party's nomination.\n\nYuma resident Arturo Hernandez and businessman Mike Norton are running in the Green Party's primary. Along with the Democrats, the Republicans, the Libertarian Party, and the No Labels Party, the Green Party has official recognition from the state.\n\nThe winner in November's general election will replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), a Democrat who broke with her party in 2022. She isn't running for reelection.\n\nAt a rally in Goodyear, Arizona on July 27, Lake made her pitch to Arizonans, including to the interests of the Navajo Nation -- a large geographical chunk of northeastern Arizona, and part of an American Indian community with significant clout.\n\n\"We've got to remind them they're sovereign, and we need to live up to the deals that we signed with them -- the treaties we signed,\" she said.\n\nDuring the Goodyear rally, Lake encouraged people to choose Abe Hamadeh in the 8th District federal primary. Attendees who spoke with The Epoch Times affirmed their support for Hamadeh, who, like Lake, has strong backing from many in the Trump base.\n\nThe former Maricopa County prosecutor's chief rival in a crowded Republican field is venture capitalist Blake Masters, who is also appreciated by many MAGA voters. Polls show a close race between the two GOP frontrunners.\n\nLike Lake, who lost the 2022 gubernatorial race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, they're competing after losses during that same cycle. Masters was defeated by Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), while Hamadeh lost the attorney general race to Democrat Kris Mayes.\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump endorsed both men in a Truth Social post over the weekend. He had previously thrown his support behind Hamadeh.\n\nBiosecurity expert Gregory Whitten is the only Democrat on that party's primary ballot.\n\nThe district is rated R+10 by the Cook Political Index, suggesting it is a relatively safe seat for the GOP. Incumbent Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) opted not to run again to represent the district, which is dominated by some of Phoenix's northern suburbs.\n\nRep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) is seeking reelection in his state's District 1, a swath of the Phoenix area ranked R+2 by Cook.\n\nThough Schweikert faces businessman Robert Backie and retired federal agent Kimberly George in his party's primary, more attention is going to a far more competitive Democratic race. Campaign finance data shows that multiple candidates have raised millions in the bid to get on the general election ballot come November.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls include businessman Andrei Cherny, who once chaired the state's Democratic Party. Wall Street veteran Conor O'Callaghan, physician and former state senator Dr. Amish Shah, and former broadcast journalist Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods are also participating in the July 30 primary.\n\nGal\u00e1n-Woods is a former Republican and the widow of the late Republican official Grant Woods. He was Arizona's attorney general during the 1990s.\n\nKurt Kroemer, past CEO of the Red Cross in the region, and Dr. Andrew Horne, an orthodontist, are in the running too.\n\nIn an interview with The Epoch Times, Horne, like other Democrats in the state, stressed abortion -- a central issue for his party this cycle and the basis for a measure that may appear on the November ballot.\n\n\"Men and women will be coming out to support their abortion rights and to remove David Schweikert,\" he predicted.\n\nA different measure that may be on the same ballot, the \"Secure Border Act,\" touches on border security, a major concern for Republicans.\n\nThe Sixth District is also only narrowly Republican, according to Cook. Incumbent Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) won the seat in 2022, defeating University of Arizona law professor Kirsten Engel.\n\nMarketer Kathleen Winn is challenging Ciscomani in the Republican primary to represent the territory, which includes much of southeastern Arizona, including land along the border with Mexico.\n\nEngel is the only Democrat in contention.\n\nAt a canvassing event on July 28 in Tucson, she told The Epoch Times she anticipates she can beat Ciscomani this go-around.\n\n\"I very, very narrowly lost to him last time,\" she said.\n\nDescribing some of her top concerns, she mentioned climate change and the high temperatures just outside the event. Tucson repeatedly broke its daily heat record during July. Engel attributed high utility costs in the state to a lack of spending on alternative energy sources.\n\nAnother relative newcomer to the House, Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska), will face an even more direct test than Engel on July 30.\n\nShe is competing against Republicans and others in the state's nonpartisan primary. The top four finishers in that contest will be positioned to appear on the November ballot.\n\nRepublican hopefuls include businessman Nick Begich III. He belongs to the Begich political family, a Democratic dynasty in the state.\n\n\"Try being a Republican Begich in Alaska,\" he quipped in an interview with The Epoch Times.\n\nLieutenant Governor Nancy Dahlstrom, another Republican, is on the ballot too. She received the Trump endorsement, which is increasingly coveted among Republicans in the party he reshaped.\n\nThe two substantively agree on policy, including energy in the oil-rich state.\n\n\"In Alaska, it's critical that we unleash our resources,\" Dahlstrom said in an interview with The Epoch Times.\n\n\"We have energy in abundance here,\" Begich said.\n\nOthers on the ballot include John Wayne Howe of the Alaskan Independence Party, who has a machine shop in Fairbanks.\n\n\"Independence for every individual Alaskan is our goal and must be executed by all peaceful and lawful means,\" he told The Epoch Times.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Masters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goodyear, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goodyear, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Arizona_Attorney_General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 Arizona Attorney General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lamb (sheriff)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schweikert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Schweikert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Norton_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W.

Headlining the election is former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake who faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer faces a challenge from fellow Republicans state Rep. Justin Heap and information technology professional Donald Hiatt in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nSeveral members of the county's governing board also face challengers aligned with Trump.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert is looking to keep it, but his reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Democrats looking to unseat him include Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair who once ran for state treasurer; ex-local news anchor Marlene Galan-Woods; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; investment banker Conor O'Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert is considered the front-runner, with challenges from businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. The winner between ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n is a favorite to win overall and represent the district spanning central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post.\n\nJesus David Mendoza and Jeff Zink are seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time in Tuesday's election. She's facing small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans farther to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook is challenging incumbent Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents the Flagstaff region and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett is facing a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a lawyer and real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

When Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat who left the party in 2022, officially decided in March not to run for re-election, the Democratic side of the race was set.\n\nOn the Republican side, Kari Lake is expected to emerge from a primary race against Mark Lamb, the Pinal County sheriff. Ms. Lake became a Republican star during her unsuccessful bid for governor two years ago, when she embraced former President Donald J. Trump and championed his lies about a stolen election in 2020.\n\nMs. Lake's scorched-earth governor's campaign divided Republicans in Arizona, and she is still working to mend fences within the party. But she is favored to defeat Sheriff Lamb, a right-wing candidate who has made tougher border restrictions a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nTwo tossup House districts\n\nTwo of Democrats' top pickup opportunities as they try to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives are in Arizona. The matchup in the Sixth Congressional District, in Tucson, is all but set, with Kirsten Engel running unopposed in the Democratic primary to challenge Representative Juan Ciscomani, a Republican, in November. Mr. Ciscomani has a long-shot challenger, Kathleen Winn, who is running to his right.\n\nBut the Democratic primary in the First Congressional District, in the Scottsdale area, is crowded, with a host of candidates vying to face Representative David Schweikert, a Republican. Voters on Tuesday will decide which of the top contenders to back: Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair; Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former broadcast journalist; Conor O'Callaghan, an investment banker;

Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nWith 66% of the votes counted, Lake was projected to win the primary with 53.3% of the vote, according to The New York Times. The Associated Press also confirmed her win.\n\n\"Thank you for putting your faith in me, Arizona. I won't let you down,\" Lake wrote on X. \"Together, we're going to save this state. Together, we're going to #MakeArizonaGrandAgain.\"\n\nLake's biggest challenger was Mark Lamb, the former sheriff of Pinal County. Both Lamb and Lake largely agreed on many major issues, including immigration, border security, and abortion. Lamb sought to portray himself as a more electable candidate.\n\nBoth candidates also voiced support for former President Donald Trump, but Lake ultimately secured the much-coveted Trump endorsement on Monday.\n\n\"She's fantastic,\" Trump said on a phone call to voters with Lake on Monday, the Associated Press reported. \"She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nLake will go on to challenge Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a congressman who has represented a district including downtown Phoenix and Glendale since 2015. Gallego ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\n\"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake,\" Gallego wrote on X following the announcement. \"Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nLake rose to prominence in the Republican Party after supporting false claims that Trump won Arizona in the 2020 election -- but was robbed of the state's electoral votes after widespread voter fraud threw the race to President Joe Biden.\n\nTwo years later, she ran as the Republican nominee for governor of the Grand Canyon State. After her defeat to current Gov. Katie Hobbs, Lake challenged the results of that election as well, and accused the Democrats of perpetuating more mass voter fraud across the state. Lake filed multiple lawsuits attempting to overturn the election, none of which have proven successful.\n\nShe was later sued by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, who claims that the former gubernatorial hopeful made false statements about his conduct during the 2020 election -- which led to death threats.\n\nLake did not fight the suit and requested default judgment.

Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLake defeated Pinal County, Arizona Sheriff Mark Lamb for the nomination.\n\nGallego won his bid for the Democratic nomination to the Senate as well, officially securing the party's nod to succeed Sinema.\n\nLake initially ran for governor of the state in 2022 but was defeated by now-Gov. Katie Hobbs, D-Ariz. Prior to her gubernatorial run, Lake was a news anchor for a local Arizona television station and had been working in the media for 27 years.\n\nLake challenged the results following her gubernatorial election loss. She still contends that there were significant irregularities in 2020 and 2022, echoing claims that former President Trump and a great number of his supporters have made about the elections. The concern has led to the Republican National Committee (RNC) devoting significant time and money to election integrity efforts.\n\nLamb has been sheriff in Pinal County since being elected in 2017. He rose to prominence in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he refused to enforce a stay-at-home order from Republican then-Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that we're here, but I need to make a stand for the people and for freedom,\" he said at the time, according to the Associated Press. \"I don't want to cite, fine or arrest fine people.\"\n\nConsequences for violating the Arizona pandemic-era order included fines of $2,500 and up to six months of jail time.\n\nLake had an advantage in the Senate competition with significant name recognition already from her 2022 campaign. Further, she enjoyed Trump's endorsement as well as numerous other Republican lawmakers.\n\nWith Sinema's decision to leave the Democratic Party and not to run for re-election in Arizona, Gallego ended up running unopposed in the Democratic primary race.\n\nGallego and Lake will now face off in the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nArizona's open Senate seat is rated as \"Lean Democratic\" by non-partisan political handicapper the Cook Political Report.

Headlining the election is former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake who faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m.\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nMaricopa County\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer faces a challenge from fellow Republicans state Rep. Justin Heap and information technology professional Donald Hiatt in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nSeveral members of the county's governing board also face challengers aligned with Trump.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert is looking to keep it, but his reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Democrats looking to unseat him include Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair who once ran for state treasurer; ex-local news anchor Marlene Galan-Woods; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; investment banker Conor O'Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert is considered the front-runner, with challenges from businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. The winner between ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n is a favorite to win overall and represent the district spanning central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post.\n\nJesus David Mendoza and Jeff Zink are seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time in Tuesday's election. She's facing small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans farther to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook is challenging incumbent Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents the Flagstaff region and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett is facing a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a lawyer and real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nHer GOP primary opponent is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who says he's more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he's struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nThe winner will face Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep.

With 62% of the votes totaled, Lake had a 53.3% to 40.7% lead over Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. A third candidate, Elizabeth Reye, had 6.1%. Gallego ran unopposed in the Democrat primary.\n\nThe winner will replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democrat base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday night. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nLamb said he was more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star in the GOP. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, D.C.,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but lost the general election by 17,117 votes

Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), setting the stage for a marquee Senate race against Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), which could determine the balance of power in the upper chamber.\n\nLake, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2022, received 53% of the vote with two-thirds of the ballots counted when the primary was called at 11:44 pm ET. Meanwhile, her primary opponent, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, received 41% of the vote. Lake's victory was much narrower than expected, which could spell larger problems for Republicans in the Grand Canyon State, where voters have repeatedly rejected former President Donald Trump and the candidates he endorses in general elections.\n\nThe former news anchor will face Gallego, who is running unopposed, to replace Sinema who was elected in 2018 but left the Democratic Party last year to become an Independent. The Arizona senator considered running as an independent but ultimately opted against it in March.\n\nAfter receiving the endorsement of Trump and out-fundraising her competitors in the Republican race, Lake has focused her messaging on Gallego and the Biden administration. According to the last campaign finance report in early July, Lake had $2.1 million in cash-on-hand, in comparison to Lamb's $263,000.\n\nGallego has nearly $8.2 million on hand, according to campaign finance records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates this race as lean Democratic.\n\nIn 2022, Lake ran for governor in the state as a hard-charging conservative outsider who was quick to turn on the GOP establishment -- and at the time, her campaign was one national Republicans kept at arm's length, worried about her electability in the battleground state. This cycle, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm endorsed Lake's candidacy in February.\n\nSince launching her campaign, she made some efforts to shift her most unpopular views, but they haven't been consistent. She criticized a near-total abortion ban in Arizona, but previously had called it a great law. Even after Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign arm, advised her to stay clear of election fraud claims; she hasn't listened.\n\nLake filed another appeal earlier this month asking the Arizona Supreme Court to declare her governor two years after she lost that election, despite her current run for the state's open Senate seat. Her attorneys filed a petition arguing the Superior Court and Court of Appeals should have reinstated her case over new evidence. Gallego is leading by 3.4 points in an average of polling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSince Sinema's victory in 2018, Arizona has transformed from a solid red state to one of the country's most competitive battlegrounds.\n\nIn 2020, Biden's victory in the state over Trump helped him secure the White House. In December 2020, Arizona had two Democratic senators for the first time since 1952 after Mark Kelly was sworn in. In 2022, Lake and three other Republicans running for major statewide offices lost. It was the first time Democrats held all major statewide positions since 1950.\n\nArizona was the only state in the 2022 midterm elections where Republicans running for top positions had all embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.

Cooper Associated Press\n\nKari Lake is leading Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb by 53% to 41% of early votes counted so far, with 4% of precincts reporting.\n\nLake is looking to easily win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nPeople are also reading...

She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary.\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nHer GOP primary opponent is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who says he is more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he has struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nThe winner will face Gallego in the race to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party to become an independent after her standing among the Democratic base cratered. Sinema considered running as an independent but opted against it.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right. Grassroots Republicans were drawn to her biting critiques of her former colleagues in the news media, her tough talk on border security and her unwavering support for Trump, who for a time considered her for his running mate.\n\n\"We're looking forward to getting you back in Washington, DC,\" Lake said to Trump during Monday's telephone rally. \"And I'm looking forward to helping back you up and make sure that we get this country gets turned back around.\"\n\nShe defeated an establishment-backed Republican in the 2022 primary for Arizona governor but narrowly lost the general election. Convinced she had victory in hand after winning the primary, Lake did not move toward the center or work to unify Republicans behind her.\n\nSince launching her Senate campaign late last year, Lake has made fitful efforts to moderate her most unpopular views but has not been consistent. She disavowed a near-total ban on abortion in Arizona, which she'd previously called \"a great law,\" but later spoke favorably for it.\n\nShe has at times steered clear of false claims of election fraud, but she continues trying to overturn her loss in the race for governor. Just this month she filed a longshot request for the Arizona Supreme Court to take up the issue, though the justices, all of whom were appointed by Republican governors, have already rejected her claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican voters in Maricopa County will get their first chance to oust elected officials who did not embrace Trump's and Lake's false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were rigged. Recorder Stephen Richer, one of the elected officials responsible for administering elections, has become a pariah on the right for aggressively defending the integrity of elections. Several members of the county board of supervisors also face challengers aligned with Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nThe feeling that elections are rigged against Republicans has permeated the Arizona GOP, though judges, election experts and Trump's own attorney general have repeatedly rejected claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"I think that there's primarily the discussion about how to do the elections and how to do them less corruptly,\" said Barb Schwisow, a retired critical care nurse who sat outside a polling place at a table full of Republican pamphlets in Sun City West, a retirement community outside Phoenix.\n\nRepublicans also have an eclectic group of candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in a safe Republican district. The field includes Blake Masters and Abraham Hamadeh, one-time allies who have turned bitterly on each other since both lost campaigns in 2022. A state lawmaker indicted for his involvement in Trump's fake-elector scheme is also running, along with former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned in 2017 when two aides said he sexually harassed them by asking them to carry a child through surrogacy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will decide two hotly contested U.S. House primaries in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe winner in the 1st Congressional District will face Republican Rep. David Schweikert to represent an affluent district centered in Scottsdale that exemplifies the changing makeup of the political parties.\n\nTwo Democrats are also facing off in a bitter primary in the 3rd District, a safe Democratic district that includes the heart of the west Phoenix Latino community. The Democratic nominee is strongly favored in November to replace Gallego.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

The outcome of those races will set the stage for critical contests that could determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate and House.\n\nThe election was moved up a week as part of a law signed earlier in the year that made some election administration changes.\n\nArizona has the largest Latino population share of any battleground state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Maricopa County also represents the largest battleground county, a former Republican stronghold that went for President Joe Biden in 2020 narrowly. Here are the races to watch in Arizona on primary night.\n\nThis primary is expected to result in the outcome of a competitive race between GOP hopeful and former gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) to replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ). Sinema was elected as a Democrat but became an independent in 2022 and she announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nWHO IS MARK KELLY? MEET ONE OF THE SIX TOP NAMES ON HARRIS'S VP SHORT LIST\n\nGallego is running unopposed in Tuesday's primary. Lake is competing in a GOP primary with Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who is her main competition in the three-candidate field. After receiving the endorsement of former President Donald Trump and out-fundraising her competitors in the Republican race, Lake has focused her messaging on Gallego and the Biden administration. According to the last campaign finance report in early July, Lake had $2.1 million in cash-on-hand, in comparison to Lamb's $263,000.\n\nGallego has nearly $8.2 million on hand, according to campaign finance records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates this race as lean Democratic. Experts say that even though Trump has been leading in recent polling in the Grand Canyon State, Republicans in the state have a history of rejecting the former president and the candidates he has endorsed in the past.\n\n\"In his two elections so far, Trump has not crossed the 50% threshold,\" Barrett Marson, a GOP strategist in Arizona, said. \"Even when he won the state, he still only had 48[%] or 49% in 2016.\"\n\nSince Sinema's victory in 2018, Arizona has transformed from a solid red state to one of the country's most competitive battlegrounds. In 2020, Biden's victory in the state over former President Donald Trump helped him secure the White House. In December 2020, Arizona had two Democratic senators for the first time since 1952 after Mark Kelly was sworn in. In 2022, Lake and three other Republicans running for major statewide offices lost. It was the first time Democrats held all major statewide positions since 1950.\n\nSeven-term Rep. David Schweikert is facing a Republican primary against former FBI agent Kim George and businessman Robert Backie. Schweikert is the front-runner and leads both fields in fundraising.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Andrei Cherney, an ex-state party chairman, and Conor O'Callaghan, an investment banker, have raised the most money. Both candidates brought in more than $2 million as of the July 10 deadline. A former local news anchor, Marlene Galan-Woods, medical doctor, Amish Shah, and orthodontist Andrew Horne are included in the field of candidates.\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks the race as a toss-up. In 2022, Schweikert won reelection by less than one percentage point, making him a critical target for Democrats in the battleground state.\n\n\"I am interested to see what shakes out of that up there, to see who's going to oppose Schweikert. I think Schweikert is very vulnerable,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a longtime Republican strategist in Arizona who left the party during the Trump era.\n\nGallego's Senate run has left an open seat up for grabs. The frontrunners for the Democratic nomination include former state Sen. Raquel Teran and former city councilwoman Yassamin Ansari. Teran has the endorsements of Sens. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Ansari has the backing of Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) and has raised closer to $2 million compared to Teran's 1.2 million, according to campaign finance records.\n\nPolls put these two neck and neck for the primary, which will likely determine who becomes the next member of Congress for this deep blue district. The district is a Democratic stronghold that went 75% for Biden in 2020. Gallego has been representing the seat since 2014.\n\nIncumbent Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ) is facing a Republican primary from rival Kathleen Winn. Ciscomani is significantly out-fundraising his opponent, with $2.7 million in cash-on-hand, compared to Winn, who has $26,000.\n\nThe winner of the primary will go on to face Democrat Kirsten Engel, who already lost to Ciscomani in 2022 by a little over 5,000 votes. Engle reported $3.2 million on hand and has been out fundraising Ciscomani. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates this race as a toss-up.\n\nThe retirement of Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ) has resulted in a competitive GOP primary, with six candidates vying for the chance to represent this comfortably red district.\n\nThe top contenders are Blake Masters, the former GOP Senate candidate who lost to Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Abe Hamadeh, the GOP's nominee for Arizona attorney general in 2022, and state Assembly Speaker Ben Toma, who has the endorsement of Lesko. Former Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ), who left office after a scandal in which he tried to convince aides to be a surrogate for him and his wife, is also in the race.\n\nTrump endorsed two candidates in the Republican primary over the weekend, in an effort to resolve the problem that he and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), made competing endorsements. Hamadeh had previously been the only candidate to get a Trump endorsement in the race, while Masters had scored an endorsement from Vance.\n\nWhile Trump called both candidates \"spectacular,\" he noted that Masters was a \"very successful businessman\" and \"an incredibly strong supporter\" of the MAGA movement. He said Hamadeh was \"a fearless fighter for election integrity.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I think Trump flipped for money purposes, and now he endorsed both candidates for the seat,\" Coughlin said. \"I sense that Masters has the momentum going into this race.\"\n\nThere has been limited polling for this race so far but has shown both Hamadeh and Masters in the lead. According to campaign finance reports, Masters has spent over $3 million so far, with $3.5 million of his $4 million in receipts coming from candidate loans. Hamadeh has spent $1.2 million, $400,000 of which is coming from his own pocket. Toma has raised more than $1 million in the race. Only $43,000 of the $643,000 Franks raised came from donors; the rest was a loan.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption\n\nArizonans have chosen Kari Lake, an election denying ally of former President Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in a race that could determine control of the chamber this fall, according to a race call by The Associated Press.\n\nWith results from early voting reported, Lake led with roughly 53% of the GOP primary vote, well more than the roughly 41% held by her rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. and a distant third challenger, Elizabeth Jean Reye. Her margin of victory will likely change as more votes are counted.\n\nShe'll face Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, who ran unopposed for his party's nomination to the Senate seat now filled by retiring Sen. Krysten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLake has been a MAGA Republican ever since launching her political career with a failed campaign for governor of Arizona in 2022. While running for the Senate, Lake continues to deny her loss to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, and earlier this month filed yet another lawsuit seeking to have the outcome of that gubernatorial race overturned - and have herself instated as governor.\n\nHer persistent election denialism may have helped her receive the support of Trump, who swiftly endorsed Lake when she entered the U.S. Senate race last fall. But it's considered a weakness by some Arizona Republicans who worry she'll lose another statewide race this fall to Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who's consistently led Lake in polls thus far.\n\nHer shifting position on abortion has also come under fire from Democrats in a state grappling with a ballot measure to enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution this fall.\n\nIn April, Lake denounced an Arizona Supreme Court ruling reviving a near-total ban on abortion in the state -- a law she previously praised as a gubernatorial candidate, when she said she was \"thrilled\" Arizona would have the ban on the books in the event the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nGallego has been a fierce ally of the abortion ballot measure in Arizona, and has vowed to abolish the Senate's filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nArizona has become a key swing state in the presidential contest, meaning even primary races have attracted high-profile endorsements and attention. The state helped President Biden clinch his win in 2020, and Democrats swept key statewide races, including the U.S. Senate seat that Masters lost, in 2022.\n\nBut Republicans now hold nearly a 260,000-person advantage among registered voters, and hope to use that to reclaim the state for Trump.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_giles@npr.org", "name": "Ben Giles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Masters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blake Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hobbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\n...\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\n...\n\n\"Go vote,\" Trump urged supporters in a telephone rally with Lake on Monday evening. \"She's fantastic. She will not let us down. Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nOn the Democrat side of the primary, unsurprisingly, Rep. Ruben Gallego handily took the nomination (as AP noted in the story linked above, he ran unopposed). Gallego jumped in the election as a challenger from the left to incumbent Senator Kyrsten Sinema (I), who--it appears--was pushed out of running for reelection by progressive activists in the Copper State. Sinema changed to Independent after voting nay and helping the Democrats' prized fillibuster bill go down to defeat, although she continued to caucus with the Dems.\n\nJust moments before AP called the race in her favor, Lake posted a message showing her gratitude to followers on X; the post appears to introduce a new slogan for the general election race--Make Arizona Grand Again--a state-centric play on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's famous catchphrase.\n\nShortly after that, she addressed supporters gathered at a campaign gathering in Phoenix, officially accepting the Republican nomination:\n\nThe new GOP Senate nominee also spoke graciously about the losing candidate, Lamb, whom she called \"[her] friend\":\n\nBallots are still arriving to be counted

Lake rose to prominence as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022, when she refused to concede the race to her Democratic challenger Katie Hobbs.\n\nHaving secured a primary victory, she will face off against the Democratic US representative Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat vacated by the centrist independent senator Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nRelated: JD Vance writes glowing foreword to Project 2025 leader's upcoming book\n\nLake, endorsed by Trump, was widely favored to win the primary against Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county. Lamb, who has far less name recognition and campaign funding than Lake, pulled in about 40% of the vote as of Tuesday night - a potential sign of general election trouble for Lake, who has alienated the more moderate voters required to win statewide in Arizona.\n\nHer contest, along with several key down-ballot races, is considered a gauge for the relative strength of the Maga movement in a key swing state that has been racked with election chaos brought on by a far-right flank pushing false claims about election fraud.\n\nLake, a former news anchor who rocked into the national stage by becoming one of the most ardent and telegenic faces of election denialism, once carried a sledgehammer on stage and told supporters she would use it on electronic voting machines.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly launched an ad against Lake, where she talks about how abortion pills should be illegal and brands her as a \"power-hungry liar who only cares about herself\". Gallego tweeted: \"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake. Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nElection prognosticators Sabato's Crystal Ball and the Cook Political Report rank the race as leaning Democratic, citing Lake's election denialism and belief in abortion restrictions as factors moving the race toward Democrats. Polling on the matchup between Gallego and Lake has generally shown Gallego up a few points over Lake.\n\nThe race is key nationally for the balance of power in the US Senate - Democrats need to keep it in their control to maintain their 51-49 majority in the chamber. It's one of few close races around the country expected to see massive funding and attention as November nears.\n\nFar-right election deniers starred in several other key Republican primary races. Abe Hamadeh, who repeatedly tried to have his loss in the 2022 attorney general election overturned and has spread conspiracy theories about election security, is leading in a crowded Republican primary in the state's deep-red eighth congressional district, where Trump made the rare move to endorse two candidates, including Hamadeh.\n\nHis Republican rivals included venture capitalist Blake Masters, who Trump endorsed last-minute, as well as state senator and fake elector Anthony Kern, Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and political newcomer Pat Briody.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Finchem, who has still not accepted that he lost his bid for secretary of state in 2022 has the lead in a race against relative moderate Republican Ken Bennett for a state senate seat.\n\nIn Arizona's Maricopa county - which includes Phoenix - election deniers vied for positions that could give them oversight in future elections. Early results show a mixed bag for election-defending county officials.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, was behind in his race for reelection as of Tuesday night. He is falling behind Justin Heap, a state representative who will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughing stock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access and is in third.\n\nDebbie Lesko, an outgoing Republican congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January 2021, has a strong lead in the primary to join the county board of supervisors over another election denier, Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and recorder played a crucial role in 2020 standing up to pressure from Trump and his allies in their scheme to overturn the results of that year's presidential election.\n\nThe recorder and many board members have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. The pressure has remained intense in the lead-up to this year's elections, with errors such as printing problems in the 2022 election adding fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nAmid the threats and harassment, two supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election.\n\nFor Gates's seat, moderate former state lawmaker Kate Brophy McGee is far ahead in the primary against Tabatha LaVoie, who said on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because: \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is trailing far behind Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, is fending off a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\".\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state senator Raquel Ter\u00e1n is trailing in her primary for Arizona's third district, for the seat that will be vacated by Gallego. A longtime organiser against anti-immigrant laws in the state, T\u00e9ran focused her campaign on protecting abortion rights. Her main rival former city council member in Phoenix, Yassamin Ansari, had raised more funds and secured several key labour endorsements, and has the lead as of Tuesday night.\n\nAnd in what is likely his last unsuccessful bid for office, the former Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, notorious for his harsh immigration regime, was trounced in a local mayoral race to lead the Phoenix suburb of Fountain Hills. Arpaio, 92, was recently kissed on the cheek by Trump at a rally in Arizona. In his run for mayor, one of his main ideas was to make the town's eponymous fountain go higher.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Republican Kari Lake were officially chosen as their parties' respective Senate nominees.\n\nBut voters also weighed in on several other contested primaries, including those for seats being vacated by Gallego and Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). The primary night also offered some clues of what voters might expect in November.\n\nHere are five early takeaways from Arizona's primaries:\n\nA winning night for election deniers\n\nTuesday night was undoubtedly a good night for election deniers.\n\nLake, who has refused to concede her 2022 election loss, won her GOP primary. Abe Hamadeh, a former attorney general candidate running in the GOP primary for the 8th Congressional District, has called the 2020 election \"rigged\" and claimed Trump won his state that year. He was leading his GOP rival Blake Masters, another Trump ally, 30 percent to 23 percent at time of publication.\n\nFormer state Rep. Mark Finchem, a former secretary of state candidate who has also espoused baseless claims about the 2020 election, was leading his next GOP rival 45 percent to 37 percent, with 60 percent of estimated vote reported as of Wednesday morning.\n\nAnd in one of the biggest surprises of the night, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a top election official who pushed back against false fraud claims about the election, was trailing one of his hardline GOP primary challengers.\n\nAll in all, the night underscored the extent to which election denialism has taken hold in the Arizona GOP's base.\n\nA marquee Senate race is set\n\nGallego and Lake had been in general election mode long before the primaries took place, as both candidates were heavily favored to win.\n\nOn Tuesday night, their matchup became official.\n\nLake had a primary rival in Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, though Decision Desk HQ quickly called the race for her on Tuesday.\n\nIn a nod to the much anticipated head-to-head, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm quickly released a new digital ad targeting Lake. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the chair of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, called the former local news anchor \"a power-hungry liar,\" while lauding Gallego as \"a proven fighter for his state's families and priorities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, called Gallego \"one of the most radical Democrats in the country\" as he congratulated Lake over her victory in her primary.\n\nAn aggregate of Arizona surveys compiled by DDHQ shows Gallego leading Lake 47 percent to 43 percent. The nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report rates the seat \"lean Democrat.\"\n\nPotential warning signs for Lake\n\nThough Lake quickly captured the Republican nomination, Lamb still received a notable chunk of the GOP primary vote.\n\nLake received 53 percent of the vote to Lamb's 41 percent with 63 percent of the estimated vote reported as of early Wednesday morning, raising questions over whether the sheriff's supporters will ultimately migrate to her in November.\n\nLake has long been a divisive figure within the GOP. She has sought to court skeptics and the McCain-faction of the Republican Party after isolating them last cycle when she ran for Arizona governor.\n\nBut the former local news anchor has in many ways run as the same conservative firebrand that she ran as in 2022, and some of those skeptical of her remain unconvinced about her candidacy.\n\nWhether that will hurt her in November remains to be seen, but the divided vote share on Tuesday suggests she might have work to do in appealing to some Republicans.\n\nMasters poised for defeat -- again\n\nMasters first gained national attention as a candidate backed by conservative entrepreneur Peter Thiel in Arizona's 2022 Senate race. He ended up losing to Democrat Mark Kelly, who is now being considered for Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nMasters looked poised to suffer yet another defeat on Tuesday night, this time in the GOP primary in Arizona's 8th Congressional District against Hamadeh.\n\nThe former Senate candidate received a last-minute endorsement from Trump -- who also threw his backing behind Masters's opponent, Hamadeh, saying both men were equally good candidates.\n\nOther Republicans who ran in the GOP contest to replace Lesko included Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma and former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.).\n\nArizona is slow at counting ballots\n\nTuesday night also underscored a key point that will be relevant for November: Arizona takes a long time to count ballots.\n\nAs of early Wednesday morning, many races had yet to be called.\n\nSome of this appears to be due to a newly enacted law that changes how mail-in ballots are verified. The law had sparked confusion among some officials as to how they should track mail ballots, according to Arizona Mirror.\n\nThe slow duration of Tuesday's count offers clues as to what to expect in November. If control of the White House or the Senate ends up hinging on Arizona, it could potentially take days to know the results of those elections.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news",

Below are some Senate races to watch:\n\nARIZONA: SUCCEEDING SINEMA Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday will pick their candidates to succeed Democrat-turned-independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who said on March 5 she would not seek reelection The Republicans seeking the nomination include Kari Lake, who had been endorsed by Republican Donald Trump during her unsuccessful 2022 run for governor, and Mark Lamb, a county sheriff.\n\nThough Lake is considered the leading candidate and has amassed endorsements from some Senate Republicans, she has also been embroiled in disputes with other Republicans, including the former head of the state Republican Party.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Ruben Gallego is expected to easily clinch his party's nomination.\n\nArizona's primaries will be held on July 30.\n\nMICHIGAN: CROWDED RACE FOR OPEN SEAT\n\nWith Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow retiring, Michigan's Senate race is poised to be competitive in a Midwestern state that is also expected to play a key role in the presidential election.\n\nRepresentative Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who currently represents a swath of communities west of Detroit, is the clear favorite for the Democratic nomination. She will face off against Hill Harper, an actor who appeared on the popular television show \"The Good Doctor.\"\n\nThe candidates vying for the Republican nomination include former lawmakers Mike Rogers, who headed the House Intelligence Committee, and Justin Amash, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus who broke with his party to call for Trump's impeachment.\n\nMichigan's primaries will take place on Aug. 6.\n\nWISCONSIN: REPUBLICANS TAKE ON BALDWIN\n\nDemocrat Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term in a state that is expected to be competitive. Eight Republicans and independents have filed to run against her.\n\nThe leading candidate for the Republican nomination is Eric Hovde, a wealthy banker who has drawn scrutiny for remarks about the voting capabilities of nursing home residents.\n\nWisconsin will hold its primaries on Aug. 13.\n\nUTAH: CROWDED REPUBLICAN PRIMARY U.S. Representative John Curtis won a crowded Republican primary to replace retiring U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, a prominent critic of former Trump who was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Curtis declined to endorse Trump. The seat is likely to remain Republican.\n\nNEW JERSEY: LOOKING TO REPLACE MENENDEZ Democratic U.S. Representative Andy Kim handily won the nomination in his bid to succeed Senator Bob Menendez, who is resigning from office next month after being found guilty of federal corruption charges.\n\nCurtis Bashaw, a hotelier, won the Republican nomination.\n\nDemocrats are strongly favored to hold the seat in November.\n\nMONTANA: VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT\n\nDemocrat Jon Tester is defending his seat, which he has held since 2007, in a Western state that backed Trump during the 2020 election.\n\nTim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL who founded an aerial firefighting company, won the June 4 Republican primary to take him on.\n\nOHIO: BROWN PLAYS DEFENSE\n\nDemocrat Sherrod Brown is playing defense in a state where Trump boasts a great deal of support. His opponent, Bernie Moreno, owned a group of car dealerships and bested several opponents in the Republican primary with Trump's endorsement.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA: SWING-STATE BATTLE\n\nBob Casey, a Democrat, is seeking a fourth term. Challenging him is Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund executive who lost the Republican primary for the Senate seat in 2022.\n\nNEVADA: ROSEN FIGHTS TO STAY ON\n\nJacky Rosen, a Democrat, is running for a second six-year term in the Senate. The race is expected to be competitive, and 16 people have filed to challenge her, nine of them Republicans.\n\nSam Brown, a military veteran who received a Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, won the crowded Republican primary to take her on.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA: NEAR-CERTAIN BET FOR REPUBLICANS\n\nWest Virginia is considered a near-certain lock for Republicans, as Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat turned independent, is retiring and Jim Justice, the state's popular governor, has won the Republican nomination.\n\nGlenn Elliott, the mayor of Wheeling, won the Democratic nomination.

Ruben Gallego in one of this fall's most important races in the battle for control of the chamber.\n\nThe two are competing for the seat of retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nLake, who had the endorsement of the Senate Republican campaign arm, is projected to defeat Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lamb had just over 40% of the Republican primary vote Tuesday night - a potential warning sign for Lake as she heads into the general election needing to consolidate the GOP base and reach out to independent voters. Gallego faced no opposition for the Democratic nomination Tuesday.\n\nLake, a former local news anchor who lost the 2022 governor's race in her first bid for political office, is a strident ally of former President Donald Trump. She is best known nationally for pushing lies about widespread election fraud - backing an audit of the 2020 presidential race and fighting in court to overturn her 2022 loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nGallego, a retired Marine who represents a deep-blue Phoenix-area seat, launched his campaign in early 2023, long before Sinema announced her retirement. Sinema was elected to the seat in 2018 as a Democrat - the first from the party to win a Senate contest in Arizona in 30 years.\n\nThis year's Senate race, like many others across the political map, has been shaken up by President Joe Biden's late decision to forgo reelection and Vice President Kamala Harris' emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have focused their attacks on Harris over her handling of border security - an issue especially important in Arizona. However, polls have shown Harris with stronger appeal than Biden among young and non-White voters, which could help Gallego in the fast-growing Sun Belt state.\n\nMany GOP donors and strategists have expressed doubts over Lake's chances of winning this fall, citing her feuds with fellow Republicans, including the family of the late Arizona Sen.

She'll face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego", "body": "Arizonans have chosen Kari Lake, an election denying ally of former President Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in a race that could determine control of the chamber this fall, according to a race call by The Associated Press.\n\nWith results from early voting reported, Lake led with roughly 53% of the GOP primary vote, well more than the roughly 41% held by her rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. and a distant third challenger, Elizabeth Jean Reye. Her margin of victory may change as more votes are counted.\n\nAt an election night rally in Phoenix after her race was called, Lake told a crowd of supporters that Arizonans had less than three-and-a-half months to save the country alongside Trump.\n\n\"He can't do this alone,\" Lake said. \"He needs backup in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nSomeone in the crowd shouted, \"He needs Kari Lake!\"\n\n\"He needs backup in Washington, D.C. and I'm gonna be his backup!\" Lake added.\n\nShe'll face Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, who ran unopposed for his party's nomination to the Senate seat now filled by retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLoading...\n\nLake has been a MAGA Republican ever since launching her political career with a failed campaign for governor of Arizona in 2022. While running for the Senate, Lake continues to deny her loss to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, and earlier this month filed yet another lawsuit seeking to have the outcome of that gubernatorial race overturned - and have herself instated as governor.\n\nHer persistent election denialism may have helped her receive the support of Trump, who swiftly endorsed Lake when she entered the U.S. Senate race last fall. But it's considered a weakness by some Arizona Republicans who worry she'll lose another statewide race this fall to Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who's consistently led Lake in polls thus far.\n\nHer shifting position on abortion has also come under fire from Democrats in a state grappling with a ballot measure to enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution this fall.\n\nIn April, Lake denounced an Arizona Supreme Court ruling reviving a near-total ban on abortion in the state -- a law she previously praised as a gubernatorial candidate, when she said she was \"thrilled\" Arizona would have the ban on the books in the event the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"From now until November, I welcome all Arizonans -- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike -- to join our team and help defeat Kari Lake and her dangerous plan to ban abortion and hurt Arizonans,\" Gallego said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nGallego has been a fierce ally of the abortion ballot measure in Arizona, and has vowed to abolish the Senate's filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nAt times during her victory speech on Tuesday, Lake sought to strike a collaborative tone, calling on \"Trump Republicans\" and \"traditional Republicans\" alike to join together to support her.\n\nAnd she also made overtures to conservatives, independents, Libertarians, and even \"disaffected Democrats.\"\n\n\"Who is ready to save this country? This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\" Lake said.\n\nArizona has become a key swing state in the presidential contest, meaning even primary races have attracted high-profile endorsements and attention. The state helped President Biden clinch his win in 2020, and Democrats swept key statewide races, including the U.S. Senate seat that Masters lost, in 2022.\n\nBut Republicans now hold nearly a 260,000-person advantage among registered voters, and hope to use that to reclaim the state for Trump.", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hobbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Republican establishment, as well as Trump, during a primary campaign where she was mentioned as a possible Trump vice presidential pick.\n\nLamb was also a Trump supporter but shied away from seeking big name endorsements during the primary election.\n\n\"Endorsements don't mean much in modern-day elections and we aren't pursuing them. That's because voters don't want to be told how to vote by political power brokers,\" Lamb's campaign told the Arizona Republic in March.\n\nHe raised many of the same issues as Lake but with a measure of elective success, a lack of money compared to his main primary opponent, and less hostility to the media covering a race that could help determine control of the U.S. Senate next year.\n\nThe Arizona Senate race is one of a handful of competitive contests in the November general election that could determine which party controls the upper chamber in the 119th Congress.\n\nBeyond Arizona, Democrats are fighting to hold onto seats in Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Cook Political Report listed Michigan, Montana, Nevada and Ohio - seats currently held by Democratic lawmakers - as \"toss ups.\" Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are currently listed as \"leans Democratic.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki",

In the GOP primary for the ruby red 8th District, an eleventh-hour endorsement from former President Donald Trump added another layer to an already bitter contest. The safe blue Phoenix-based seat being vacated by Gallego has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. And a half-dozen Democrats are scrambling to take on longtime Republican Rep. David Schweikert in a district that President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020.\n\n-- AZ-Sen: Lake is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination over Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, seen as her most serious competition, and another little-known candidate. Her competitors have failed to gain traction in the primary against the Trump ally, who has a strong standing among the MAGA base but is working to try to expand her appeal to the broader electorate.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to keep the seat after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema left the party to become an independent and chose not to run for reelection -- which could have scrambled the general election for both parties.\n\nIn light of a lack of serious competition on either side, campaigning in the lead-up to the primary has already shifted to the general election. Gallego has a substantial cash advantage over Lake: His campaign coffers are close to four times as large as hers as of early July, and from the beginning of the year through Tuesday, he has spent more than $15 million on advertising compared with $2 million from Lake and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which endorsed her, according to ad tracker AdImpact.\n\n-- AZ-01: Democrats have their sights set on Schweikert, who narrowly eked out a win in the midterms by less than 1 point. Biden won this battleground by around 2 points in 2020.\n\nThe busy field of Democrats looking to unseat Schweikert includes former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Andrei Cherny; former state Rep. Amish Shah; former journalist Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods; finance executive Conor O'Callaghan; orthodontist Andrew Horne; and former American Red Cross regional CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nThere isn't much public polling in this race, though Cherny, O'Callaghan (thanks to a hefty personal loan) and Gal\u00e1n-Woods have led the field in fundraising. The Democrats have leaned heavily on vows to protect abortion rights in their messaging -- especially in light of the state Supreme Court upholding the state's near-total abortion ban earlier this year, which was later repealed. Gal\u00e1n-Woods, the only woman in the race, has especially seized on that, and has emphasized her endorsements from EMILYs List and state Attorney General Kris Mayes. But she's also faced attacks over being a registered Republican until 2018.\n\n-- AZ-02: Rep. Eli Crane was one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy. But the former speaker's revenge tour doesn't seem to be making a stop in Arizona.\n\nCrane faces a primary challenge from Jack Smith, a former Yavapai County supervisor. Crane has sought to tie Smith to McCarthy, which the challenger has denied. McCarthy's affiliated groups have largely stayed out of the race, with the exception of an aligned nonprofit running a spot hitting Crane on immigration through the end of last month. Crane has far outpaced Smith in fundraising, a sign of Smith's lack of momentum. Another McCarthy detractor -- Rep. Andy Biggs in AZ-05 -- didn't even face a primary challenge.\n\n-- AZ-03: The Democratic primary to succeed Gallego has garnered plenty of national attention, with former Phoenix Vice Mayor Yassamin Ansari and former state Sen. Raquel Tera\u0301n emerging as the front-runners. The winner of the primary will be on a clear path to victory, given the Democratic lean of the seat.\n\nProtect Progress, a pro-crypto group that has spent in support of Democratic candidates nationally, has dropped more than $1 million backing Ansari. Tera\u0301n's campaign has taken issue with that spending, pointing to the group's prominent Republican donors. Ansari has also been boosted by pro-Israel DMFI PAC and Mainstream Democrats, a super PAC backed in part by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman that sought to tie Tera\u0301n to Republicans.\n\nTera\u0301n, meanwhile, has touted her progressive accolades, including support from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Planned Parenthood Action, the Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus' political arm is backing Tera\u0301n, who would be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress. She's also backed by Sen. Mark Kelly, one of the possible running mates for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n-- AZ-06: Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel are poised for a rematch after Engel lost to Ciscomani by around 1 point in the midterms. Engel is uncontested in the Democratic primary, though Ciscomani faces a nominal challenge from the right.\n\nThe general election for the 6th District is expected to be one of the most competitive House seats this year. Ciscomani is one of a handful of Republicans currently representing a seat that Biden won (which he did by less than 1 point) in 2020.\n\n-- AZ-08: Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh -- the failed 2022 Republican Senate and state attorney general candidates, respectively -- have been attacking each other for months in the bitter primary for this ruby red seat to replace retiring Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko.\n\nMasters and his allies have taken shots at Hamadeh by strongly implying he is Muslim. (Hamadeh has said he does not identify with any particular faith.) Masters and his supporters also ran ads featuring Trump's endorsement two years ago in the Senate race, which drew the ire of Hamadeh, whom Trump endorsed for this race back in December.\n\nBut the weekend before the election, Trump issued a rare double endorsement for both Masters and Hamadeh -- potentially neutralizing Hamadeh's perceived leg up in the primary, though many votes had already been cast by that point.\n\nA handful of other candidates are also running, including state House Speaker Ben Toma, who has the backing of outside groups like Americans for Prosperity Action, and former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after female staffers said he approached them about being a surrogate for him and his wife, is on the ballot as well. It's possible that another candidate can find an opening as Masters and Hamadeh attack each other.\n\n-- Arizona state Legislature: The state legislative races are setting up to be among the most tense this cycle, with Democrats mounting an aggressive campaign to flip both chambers and Republicans dealing with sparring between the moderate and MAGA wings. Republicans hold a slim majority in both the state House and Senate.\n\nIn Arizona, 30 legislative districts are each represented by one state senator and two state representatives. And among the most contested is the 17th District, an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood in Tucson that is represented by Republicans but Democrats have made inroads in recent years. The GOP state Senate primary there is a close race between an incumbent and former incumbent -- and it's gotten ugly.\n\nState Sen. Justine Wadsack is defending her seat against Vince Leach, an incumbent whom she beat in 2022. Leach was a more traditional Republican who veered right on social issues toward the end of his tenure by pushing bills to ban children from attending drag shows. Wadsack, meanwhile, is a member of the Freedom Caucus and behind bills attempting to keep sexually explicit material out of school libraries.\n\nOn the Democratic side, two progressives are trying to oust a conservative Democrat, state Rep. Lydia Hernandez, in LD 24, a district with the highest concentration of Latino and Hispanic voters. Hernandez is on the outs with many Democrats after siding with Republicans on some issues like abortion and her support of former GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. She filed an ethics complaint against several fellow members of the Latino Caucus, accusing them of falsely imprisoning her and holding her hostage at a meeting over political differences. The state House Ethics Committee later dropped the complaint.\n\nMadison Fernandez reported from New York.

Headlining the election is former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake who faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer faces a challenge from fellow Republicans state Rep. Justin Heap and information technology professional Donald Hiatt in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nSeveral members of the county's governing board also face challengers aligned with Trump.\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert is looking to keep it, but his reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Democrats looking to unseat him include Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair who once ran for state treasurer; ex-local news anchor Marlene Galan-Woods; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; investment banker Conor O'Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert is considered the front-runner, with challenges from businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. The winner between ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n is a favorite to win overall and represent the district spanning central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post.\n\nJesus David Mendoza and Jeff Zink are seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time in Tuesday's election. She's facing small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans farther to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook is challenging incumbent Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents the Flagstaff region and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett is facing a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a lawyer and real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Ruben Gallego in Arizona as the GOP tries to claw back power in a state that has become a high-stakes battleground.\n\nGallego and Lake easily clinched their respective parties' nominations Tuesday for the Senate seat, which is open after independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema chose not to run for reelection. Gallego was uncontested in his primary, and Lake fended off two candidates, including Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, her most serious competition.\n\nThe general election has already effectively been underway for months.\n\nGallego has been working to introduce himself to the statewide electorate after representing the Phoenix area in the House for a decade. Gallego had already dropped more than $15 million on advertisements in the lead-up to the primary, with an additional $18 million booked through November, according to ad tracker AdImpact. Gallego's ads have primarily been biographical, focusing on his story of growing up in a single-parent immigrant household and becoming a Marine.\n\nLake has taken a very different approach.\n\nOn the airwaves, she has gone aggressively after Gallego on immigration, typically seen as a weak spot for Democrats. (Gallego has sought to neutralize those attacks by proactively messaging on his work on the Southern border, a rarity for Democrats.) Most of her ad spending ahead of the primary -- $2 million -- has been in coordination with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which endorsed her, and the campaign has $6 million booked in future reservations.\n\nLake benefits from statewide name ID from her unsuccessful run in 2022 for governor. In that race, the former news anchor lost by less than 1 percentage point to Democratic now-Gov. Katie Hobbs, a result that Lake vehemently -- and baselessly -- denied long after the election.\n\nLake is still spreading false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen and railing against the \"fake news.\" When British journalist Emily Maitlis asked her earlier this month whether she would concede should she lose in November, Lake told her that she thinks Maitlis needs her \"head examined.\"\n\nAs Lake rose to prominence in 2022, she gained national attention as a close ally of and surrogate for former President Donald Trump -- enough to be considered a vice presidential contender at one point. Trump endorsed her in both her gubernatorial and Senate campaigns and took part in a tele-rally for Lake on the eve of Tuesday's primary.\n\nRepublicans have struggled in recent years to nominate Republican candidates in primaries -- where MAGA figures have dominated -- who are capable of winning a general election. In the midterms, the embrace of weak general election nominees led to smaller-than-expected gains for the GOP in Congress.\n\nThis year, the NRSC has had a heavy hand in recruiting candidates and clearing primary fields to elevate those they see as the most electable. The committee's strategy has worked in their favor so far -- with nominal competition in primaries that could have otherwise drained resources ahead of high-stakes general elections. In Arizona, as it became clear that Lake would have no serious primary competition, national Republicans coalesced around her in hopes of bringing her over the finish line come November.\n\nNow Lake is working to expand her appeal to a broader electorate and court establishment Republicans, some of whom are still skeptical of her following the hard-right profile she cultivated for herself just a couple of years ago. (Gallego, who has a progressive record that Republicans have sought to highlight, has also looked to cater to the center.)\n\nWith fewer than 100 days to go until Election Day, there are clear signs Lake still has plenty of work to do.\n\nLake proved to be a strong fundraiser in the aftermath of the 2022 election, raising millions as she dragged out unsuccessful litigation for months, claiming that the race was rigged against her. But now, she's lagging behind Gallego.\n\nAs of early July, Gallego had almost four times as much in his coffers compared with Lake, $8.2 million to $2.1 million. In the first 10 days of July, he raised more than $1 million, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. Lake brought in $325,000 during that period. Gallego also outraised her in the second quarter of this year, $10.5 million to $4.3 million.\n\nAnd messaging from allies of Lamb, who lost to Lake in the primary, could be a warning: \"Donald Trump needs a workhorse in the Senate, not a show horse,\" a spot from conservative group American Encore running in the lead-up to the primary said.\n\nGallego, a former state legislator, has been running for the Senate seat since early last year, when Sinema's candidacy was still a question hovering over the race. If elected, Gallego would be Arizona's first Latino senator.\n\nRepublicans have struggled statewide in Arizona in recent years. In 2022, Republican Blake Masters lost to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly by 5 points. Democrats also flipped the Senate seat in 2020 during a special election, and now-President Joe Biden narrowly clinched the state then, too.\n\nThe state is poised to again play a key role, both in the presidential election and determining control of the Senate. And it could take on an even higher-profile role should Vice President Kamala Harris choose Kelly as her running mate.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Lake rose to prominence as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022, when she refused to concede the race to her Democratic challenger Katie Hobbs.\n\nHaving secured a primary victory, she will face off against the Democratic US representative Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat vacated by the centrist independent senator Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nRelated: JD Vance writes glowing foreword to Project 2025 leader's upcoming book\n\nLake, endorsed by Trump, was widely favored to win the primary against Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county. Lamb, who has far less name recognition and campaign funding than Lake, pulled in about 40% of the vote as of Tuesday night - a potential sign of general election trouble for Lake, who has alienated the more moderate voters required to win statewide in Arizona.\n\nHer contest, along with several key down-ballot races, is considered a gauge for the relative strength of the Maga movement in a key swing state that has been racked with election chaos brought on by a far-right flank pushing false claims about election fraud.\n\nLake, a former news anchor who rocked into the national stage by becoming one of the most ardent and telegenic faces of election denialism, once carried a sledgehammer on stage and told supporters she would use it on electronic voting machines.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly launched an ad against Lake, where she talks about how abortion pills should be illegal and brands her as a \"power-hungry liar who only cares about herself\". Gallego tweeted: \"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake. Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nElection prognosticators Sabato's Crystal Ball and the Cook Political Report rank the race as leaning Democratic, citing Lake's election denialism and belief in abortion restrictions as factors moving the race toward Democrats. Polling on the matchup between Gallego and Lake has generally shown Gallego up a few points over Lake.\n\nThe race is key nationally for the balance of power in the US Senate - Democrats need to keep it in their control to maintain their 51-49 majority in the chamber. It's one of few close races around the country expected to see massive funding and attention as November nears.\n\nFar-right election deniers starred in several other key Republican primary races. Abe Hamadeh, who repeatedly tried to have his loss in the 2022 attorney general election overturned and has spread conspiracy theories about election security, is leading in a crowded Republican primary in the state's deep-red eighth congressional district, where Trump made the rare move to endorse two candidates, including Hamadeh.\n\nHis Republican rivals included venture capitalist Blake Masters, who Trump endorsed last-minute, as well as state senator and fake elector Anthony Kern, Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and political newcomer Pat Briody.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Finchem, who has still not accepted that he lost his bid for secretary of state in 2022 has the lead in a race against relative moderate Republican Ken Bennett for a state senate seat.\n\nIn Arizona's Maricopa county - which includes Phoenix - election deniers vied for positions that could give them oversight in future elections. Early results show a mixed bag for election-defending county officials.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, was behind in his race for reelection as of Tuesday night. He is falling behind Justin Heap, a state representative who will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughing stock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access and is in third.\n\nDebbie Lesko, an outgoing Republican congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January 2021, has a strong lead in the primary to join the county board of supervisors over another election denier, Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and recorder played a crucial role in 2020 standing up to pressure from Trump and his allies in their scheme to overturn the results of that year's presidential election.\n\nThe recorder and many board members have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. The pressure has remained intense in the lead-up to this year's elections, with errors such as printing problems in the 2022 election adding fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nAmid the threats and harassment, two supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election.\n\nFor Gates's seat, moderate former state lawmaker Kate Brophy McGee is far ahead in the primary against Tabatha LaVoie, who said on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because: \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is trailing far behind Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, is fending off a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\".\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state senator Raquel Ter\u00e1n is trailing in her primary for Arizona's third district, for the seat that will be vacated by Gallego. A longtime organiser against anti-immigrant laws in the state, T\u00e9ran focused her campaign on protecting abortion rights. Her main rival former city council member in Phoenix, Yassamin Ansari, had raised more funds and secured several key labour endorsements, and has the lead as of Tuesday night.\n\nAnd in what is likely his last unsuccessful bid for office, the former Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, notorious for his harsh immigration regime, was trounced in a local mayoral race to lead the Phoenix suburb of Fountain Hills. Arpaio, 92, was recently kissed on the cheek by Trump at a rally in Arizona. In his run for mayor, one of his main ideas was to make the town's eponymous fountain go higher.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who ran uncontested for his party's nomination. The winner will replace outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who said in March she would not seek reelection.\n\nLake, a former local news anchor, has made a name for herself as a hard-right Republican in Donald Trump's mold -- not only amplifying his lies about the 2020 election being stolen, but saying the same about her own unsuccessful race for governor in 2022. (Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, defeated Lake by 17,000 votes.) Lake played a video of Trump endorsing her when she launched her campaign in October, and Trump again voiced his support for Lake in a call with supporters Monday.\n\nLake is currently still litigating the last election -- as the defendant in an ongoing defamation lawsuit from Stephen Richer, a Republican and the elected recorder in Maricopa County, Arizona's largest county.After Lake accused Richer of intentionally sabotaging the 2022 election, Richer sued for defamation. In March, Lake declined to defend herself against Richer's suit, calling it a \"perversion of our legal system.\" Discovery is ongoing in the dispute.\n\nLake was widely expected to beat Republican challenger Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal County, in the Senate primary. The real question in some analysts' minds was just how much Lake would win by -- and whether it would be enough to make her a compelling general-election candidate.\n\n\"Kari Lake can't just win the July 30 Republican Senate primary,\" Arizona Republic columnist Laurie Roberts wrote Tuesday morning. \"She's got to blow Mark Lamb's cowboy hat into the next time zone.\"\n\nRepublican consultants told Roberts that Lake would do well to earn upward of 55% of the primary vote, in order to show she can unite the state's Republican Party against Gallego in the general election.\n\nIn head-to-head general-election polling, Gallego currently has an edge over Lake, and held a lead evenbefore Sinema announced her departure.\n\nThat's in part because of Lake's brand of Trumpism, which includes election denial, border hysteria and attacking the late GOP Sen. John McCain (something she later tried to walk back). This approach is popular with a portion of Arizona's Republicans, but it's not necessarily the ticket to statewide office, as Lake found out two years ago when she lost the governorship to Hobbs.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hobbs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lamb (sheriff)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maricopa_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Cryptozoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Cryptozoology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4703cb184dabbf673f9a4167e0b17426", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775014", "eventUri": "eng-9775014", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1588, "textEnd": 1595}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

These general election losses in 2020 and 2022 ended decades-long Republican dominance, delivering the governor's office and other top spots to Democrats.\n\nThe results could foretell whether Arizonans, particularly Arizona Republicans, are ready to move on from election denialism and the far-right flank that controls the state party. And that lesson could carry into November in the swing state, which Biden narrowly won in 2020 in an upset.\n\nLake, who lost the governor's race in 2022, is now running for US Senate. She faces Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, but she is expected to win the Republican contest on Tuesday. The winner will face the Democratic representative Ruben Gallego. The seat is open after senator Kyrsten Sinema left the Democratic party and decided not to run for re-election, making it a top race to watch nationally for control of the chamber.\n\nGallego's run for Senate leaves a race for his House seat in a strong Democratic district, where the former state lawmaker Raquel Ter\u00e1n is facing the former Phoenix vice-mayor Yassamin Ansari.\n\nOther prominent Republicans who embraced election lies and lost their 2022 races are back in the mix now, too.\n\nAbe Hamadeh, who narrowly lost the attorney general election in 2022, is now in a crowded primary to fill the seat of Debbie Lesko, the Republican representative who will vacate congressional district 8.\n\nHamadeh has Trump and Lake's endorsements in the crowded field, though Trump made the late decision to also endorse Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel acolyte who lost in the US Senate race in 2022. Trump called Hamadeh and Masters \"two spectacular America First Candidates\".\n\n\"Blake Masters is a very successful businessman, and an incredibly strong supporter of our Movement to Make America Great Again - He is smart and tough! Likewise, Abe Hamadeh, a Veteran, former prosecutor, and fearless fighter for Election Integrity, has been with me all the way!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.\n\nThe primary field also includes Anthony Kern, senator and fake elector; Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and Pat Briody.\n\nMark Finchem, who lost his bid for secretary of state and still has not agreed he lost, is trying to return to the statehouse, running against a more moderate Republican, Ken Bennett, for a state senate seat.\n\nSeveral Maricopa county offices with primary elections include people who either say the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen or will not say whether they believe the elections were valid.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, faces primary challengers who have questioned election results. Justin Heap, state representative, will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughingstock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and the recorder, which both play roles overseeing elections, stood up to intense pressure campaigns from Trump and his allies in 2020 and have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. Errors like printing problems in the 2022 election have added fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nThe county primaries could land election deniers or skeptics into roles overseeing elections. Two of the supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election, in part because of the threats and harassment. This assures that the board will not have the same makeup next year.\n\nLesko, the congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January, is vying for Hickman's seat. She faces Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University, who has spread false claims about elections, including the one where he lost a state superintendent race in 2018.\n\nFor Gates's seat, Kate Brophy McGee, a Republican former state lawmaker who, at times, voted against her party in the legislature, faces Tabatha LaVoie, who says on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe two other Republican supervisors face primary challengers who are farther right, especially on election issues.\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is facing a challenge from Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, will need to beat back a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\". Ugenti-Rita faced accusations of sexual harassment from a female lobbyist after Ugenti-Rita claimed she was harassed by a state lawmaker who was ousted from the chamber over a pattern of harassment.\n\nRelated: 'Democracy is teetering': at ground zero for Trump's big lie in Arizona\n\nIn the politically fraught state, some other races could also have widespread impact.\n\nDavid Schweikert, a longtime representative, has Republican challengers and a crowded Democratic primary in congressional district 1 because recent elections showed Schweikert to be vulnerable to a Democratic ouster.\n\nOn the right, Robert Backie and Kim George want to beat Schweikert, though he is expected to win the nomination. And on the left, contenders include Andrei Cherny, Marlene Galan-Woods, Andrew Horne, Kurt Kroemer, Conor O'Callaghan and Amish Shah.\n\nShawnna Bolick, a state senator who voted to repeal a territorial-era abortion ban and the wife of a state supreme court justice, will have to fend off a challenge from the right in what could be seen as a test for how Republican voters view abortion bans.\n\nAnother outspoken election denier, Wendy Rogers, is being challenged for her senate seat by David Cook, a relative moderate.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) are poised to become the official nominees in a blockbuster Senate race that will help determine control of the upper chamber as Arizonans conclude voting in their primaries Tuesday.\n\nThe Grand Canyon State is also hosting several contested primaries for two outgoing House incumbents: Gallego and Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). The latter race features a match-up between two hard-line loyalists of former President Trump.\n\nArguably one of the more consequential races is the Republican primary in the Maricopa County recorder's election between incumbent Stephen Richer and two Republican opponents -- an election that could serve as a litmus test for the direction of the Republican Party in Arizona.\n\nHere are five races to watch in Arizona's primaries:\n\nLake, Gallego get ready for official coronation\n\nLake and Gallego are all but in name the official GOP and Democratic nominees to face off for retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's (I-Ariz.) seat in November.\n\nThe two have largely been in general election mode, taking swipes at each other even though Lake has a Republican primary challenger -- Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb.\n\nLake is widely expected to beat Lamb on Tuesday, though the margin between the two could offer clues about how the GOP electorate feels about the former local news anchor ahead of November.\n\nShe has sought to court skeptics and the McCain-aligned faction of the GOP, though some have remained unmoved by her efforts. But some Republicans say Lake could benefit from Democrats' recent shake-up at the top of the ticket with Vice President Harris as their likely nominee as she's fielded attacks over immigration -- a key issue in the Grand Canyon State.\n\nAnother variable that could throw a curveball in the race is whether Harris picks Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) as her running mate. Republicans and Democrats alike believe that could help Gallego to have the astronaut on the ticket.\n\nTrump loyalists Blake Masters, Abe Hamadeh face off\n\nBlake Masters, a venture capitalist and former Senate candidate, and Abe Hamadeh, who ran for attorney general last cycle, are duking it out in the House GOP primary to replace the retiring Lesko.\n\nThe two men are seen as the front-runners in the crowded Republican field for the GOP-friendly 8th Congressional District. Other candidates include Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma (R) and former Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who once held Lesko's seat but left the House amid revelations that he had asked several aides about having his child as a paid surrogate.\n\nMasters and Hamadeh have both strongly aligned themselves with Trump, and the primary at times has turned nasty. Masters criticized Hamadeh in May, saying \"what we don't need is someone with no wife and kids, no skin in the game.\"\n\nHamadeh's campaign hit back at Masters's statement, saying, \"This is the guy who says an Army Reserve Captain & Intelligence Officer doesn't have 'skin in the game' in the fight to save our country.\" Hamadeh has also called the venture capitalist a \"snake.\"\n\nWhile Trump initially only endorsed Hamadeh in the race, the former president offered an unexpected twist on Saturday when he said he was endorsing both Masters and Hamadeh, much to the chagrin of the latter.\n\nWhoever wins Tuesday's primary is the favorite to win in November.\n\nGOP election official who validates 2020 election vies for reelection\n\nDown-ballot races usually don't generate a lot of attention given their local nature, but one race worth watching is the Maricopa County recorder GOP primary between current Recorder Stephen Richer and two hard-line conservatives: state Rep. Justin Heap -- a member of the Arizona Freedom Caucus -- and Donald Hiatt, who has experience in information management technology.\n\nThe Maricopa County recorder handles early voting and oversees voter rolls, among other responsibilities.\n\nRicher, who officially became recorder in 2021, validated the 2020 and 2022 election results and has repeatedly defended Maricopa County's election administration despite the prevalence of conspiracy theories inaccurately claiming there has been wrongdoing. He's drawn the ire of conservatives like Lake, filing a defamation lawsuit against her.\n\nRicher has been endorsed by several prominent Republicans, including former Govs. Doug Ducey and Jan Brewer.\n\nThe more serious competitor to Richer is Heap, given his previous political experience and his endorsements from Lake and Arizona GOP Reps. Paul Gosar, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs. The race could offer signs of the state Republican Party's direction.\n\nA bonus race to watch is the GOP primary between Maricopa County Supervisor Thomas Galvin, who's running for reelection and has been endorsed by mainstream Republicans like Brewer and former Rep. John Shadegg. He's vying for the seat against former state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has the backing of hard-line conservatives like Hamadeh and Arizona Freedom Caucus chair and state Sen. Jake Hoffman.\n\nThree Democrats angle for Gallego's seat\n\nThree Democrats are running for Gallego's seat in the 3rd Congressional District, a blue stronghold, after Gallego announced he was running for Senate.\n\nRaquel Ter\u00e1n, a former state senator who chaired the Arizona Democratic Party, former Phoenix Vice Mayor Yassamin Ansari and pediatrician Duane Wooten are all running for the seat. Ter\u00e1n and Ansari are considered the two top competitors in the race, and both women have attracted notable endorsements in the race.\n\nSens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in addition to Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), have backed the former Arizona Democratic Party chair. Meanwhile, former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) have backed Ansari.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic primary Tuesday is the heavy favorite to win the seat in November.\n\nA crowded field of Democrats looks to take on Schweikert\n\nA crowded field of six Democrats is running to take on Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) this fall.\n\nThose candidates include Andrei Cherny, a former chair of the Arizona Democratic Party who's also served as Arizona assistant attorney general; global financial services firm managing director Conor O'Callaghan; Kurt Kroemer, the CEO of the American Red Cross's Arizona and New Mexico region; former broadcast journalist Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods; former state Rep. Amish Shah; and orthodontist Andrew Horne.\n\nThe primary has racked up some high-profile endorsements. Former President Clinton, former state Attorney General Terry Goddard and Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego have backed Cherny. Several House Democrats, including Rep. Dan Goldman (N.Y), and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), have backed O'Callaghan.\n\nGal\u00e1n-Woods has the backing of key members of the Arizona Democratic establishment, like former governor and former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and state Attorney General Kris Mayes. Arizona state House Minority Leader Lupe Contreras has endorsed Shah.\n\nSchweikert's seat is considered a \"toss up\" by the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report.", "source":

Katie Hobbs (D).\n\n\"Congratulations to Kari Lake on her commanding victory in tonight's primary,\" said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Steve Daines. \"Arizonans must unite to defeat Ruben Gallego, one of the most radical Democrats in the country.

Kari Lake will work with President Trump to secure the border, get crime under control, and bring down prices.\"\n\nFollowing her primary victory Tuesday night, Gallego released a statement hitting Lake over reproductive rights.\n\n\"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake. Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights,\" Gallego said.\n\n\"Thank you for putting your faith in me, Arizona. I won't let you down.

Ruben Gallego", "body": "PHEONIX -- Kari Lake has won Arizona's Republican Senate primary, defeating Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and Elizabeth Reye.\n\n\"If you think this is a battle between Democrats and Republicans, you're still sleeping,\" Lake said in her victory speech, calling on Trump Republicans, traditional Republicans, \"disaffected Democrats,\" and others to come together.\n\nLake, a former Phoenix-area television news anchor and Republicans' 2022 gubernatorial nominee, was favored to win the primary with a significant lead in most polls.\n\nHer victory sets up a general election contest with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who ran unopposed in the Democratic Senate primary.\n\nDuring her victory speech, the Iowa-born Lake brandished what she described as an opposition research file on Gallego, calling him extreme and highlighting his Chicago origins.\n\nGallego's victory was called shortly after the polls closed at 7:00 p.m. local time. The Associated Press called Lake's victory in the primary at 8:44 p.m. local time.\n\n\"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake,\" Gallego wrote on X shortly after Lake's victory was projected. \"Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nAs of 9 p.m. local time, Lake had won 53.3 percent of the vote, according to the Associated Press, and carried all but two counties in the state. Lamb had 40.7 percent as of that same time, while Reye had 6.1 percent.\n\nLake and Gallego are seeking to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who is not seeking reelection. Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party after the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMatthew Martinez, who leads the legal ballot-chasing effort for conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action, lauded Lake's win in a speech at her victory party.\n\n\"This is a good victory... but we have to win our general,\" Martinez said on stage.\n\nSenators from Arizona, a battleground state, have often received a spotlight in national politics. The late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ran for president in 2000, where he was Texas Gov. George W. Bush's primary opponent, and in 2008, when he won the nomination but was defeated in the general election by Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).\n\nMcCain later attracted national prominence for his criticism of candidate Donald Trump in 2016 and, later, during his presidency. McCain succeeded the late Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), who was the Republican nominee in the 1964 presidential election against President Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater later played a key role in defense policy and is often regarded as a pivotal figure in the conservative movement.\n\nArizona's other senator, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), is named as a possible running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nMost polls show Gallego with a lead over Lake. He has also significantly outraised Lake in terms of campaign contributions. Lake's candidacy has attracted controversy for her legal challenges to the 2022 gubernatorial election, where she claims she won the race against Gov. Katie Hobbs. She has been endorsed by Trump as well as the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party's Senate campaign arm.\n\nEarlier on July 30, Gallego and his wife visited the South Phoenix Missionary Baptist Church to drop off their ballots, which were mailed to them ahead of time. In a subsequent press conference, Gallego criticized Lake's unwillingness to commit to a general election debate hosted by the Arizona Clean Debates Commission.\n\n\"I don't understand why Kari Lake is afraid of an even, grounded debate,\" Gallego said.\n\nLake said she didn't want to work with the debate commission, citing her treatment during the 2022 midterms.\n\n\"We've seen how they treated people the last election cycle back in 2022, where people who decided not to do the debate, namely Hobbs, ended up getting her own half-an-hour. That was my problem,\" Lake told reporters on July 30.\n\nShe indicated that her campaign would consult with Gallego about a possible debate in another forum.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turning Point Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Goldwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Here are some of the ones I'm keeping an eye on.\n\nLast year, I referred to the race in Arizona's 8th Congressional District -- a seat being vacated by Rep. Debbie Lesko, a far-right Republican -- as a \"Mr. MAGA pageant.\" And the GOP candidates -- Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh, in particular -- have really made that look like a great call as they've competed for MAGA voters' affection in the deep-red district. This race is interesting because, as my MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote for the MaddowBlog, Hamadeh initially received former President Donald Trump's sole endorsement. But just this week, Trump came out and also endorsed Masters, who's a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Peter Thiel's -- just like Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nThe race for Maricopa County recorder -- the Phoenix area's top elections official -- has come into focus as Trump allies have spread election falsehoods about Stephen Richer, the GOP incumbent. Richer is running in the GOP primary against state Rep. Justin Heap and Don Hiatt, who have both tried to sow distrust in the integrity of elections in Arizona. A win Tuesday for Richer, who has garnered bipartisan praise for standing up to election deniers, seems like the best way to keep a Republican in the recorder's office. A victory by Heap or Hiatt could open the door for the Democratic candidate, Timothy Stringham, to win in November.\n\nI'll also be watching the packed Democratic primary in Arizona's 1st Congressional District. The district is currently represented by Rep. David Schweikert, and Democrats see the beleaguered Republican's seat as one of the most vulnerable in Congress due to his ethics scandals. This is a district that I felt Democrats foolishly neglected in 2022, so the winner of this primary will have another shot at it. Former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Andrei Cherny appears to be in pole position, but recent polling showed the race as tight.\n\nFailed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake seems likely to win her race against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in Arizona's GOP primary for a U.S. Senate seat. But if she does, the margin could tell a deeper story. Lake has turned off Arizona Republicans, at times, particularly due to her attacks on fellow Republicans. If she merely ekes out a win, it could indicate weak Republican support for Lake -- which certainly wouldn't be ideal ahead of a general election matchup against the Democratic candidate, Rep.

Headlining the election is former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake who faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m.\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nMaricopa County\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer faces a challenge from fellow Republicans state Rep. Justin Heap and information technology professional Donald Hiatt in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nSeveral members of the county's governing board also face challengers aligned with Trump.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIncumbent Republican Rep. David Schweikert is looking to keep it, but his reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe Democrats looking to unseat him include Andrei Cherny, a former state party chair who once ran for state treasurer; ex-local news anchor Marlene Galan-Woods; orthodontist Andrew Horne; former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer; investment banker Conor O'Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert is considered the front-runner, with challenges from businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. The winner between ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n is a favorite to win overall and represent the district spanning central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post.\n\nJesus David Mendoza and Jeff Zink are seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time in Tuesday's election. She's facing small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans farther to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook is challenging incumbent Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents the Flagstaff region and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett is facing a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a lawyer and real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType":

Lake rose to prominence as a gubernatorial candidate in 2022, when she refused to concede the race to her Democratic challenger Katie Hobbs.\n\nHaving secured a primary victory, she will face off against US representative Ruben Gallego for an open Senate seat vacated by centrist senator Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nLake, endorsed by Trump, was widely favored to win the primary against Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county. Lamb, who has far less name recognition and campaign funding than Lake, pulled in about 40% of the vote as of Tuesday night - a potential sign of general election trouble for Lake, who has alienated the more moderate voters required to win statewide in Arizona.\n\nHer contest, along with several key down-ballot races, is considered a gauge for the relative strength of the Maga movement in a key swing state that has been racked with election chaos brought on by a far-right flank pushing false claims about election fraud.\n\nLake, a former news anchor who rocked into the national stage by becoming one of the most ardent and telegenic faces of election denialism, once carried a sledgehammer on stage and told supporters she would use it on electronic voting machines.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly launched an ad against Lake, where she talks about how abortion pills should be illegal and brands her as a \"power-hungry liar who only cares about herself\". Gallego tweeted: \"It's official - my opponent is Kari Lake. Arizona, the choice is clear: Kari wants to ban abortion. I will always protect abortion rights.\"\n\nFar-right election deniers starred in several other key Republican primary races. Abe Hamadeh, who repeatedly tried to have his loss in the 2022 attorney general election overturned and has spread conspiracy theories about election security, is leading in a crowded Republican primary in the state's deep-red eighth congressional district, where Trump made the rare move to endorse two candidates, including Hamadeh.\n\nHis Republican rivals included venture capitalist Blake Masters, who Trump endorsed last-minute, as well as state senator and fake elector Anthony Kern, Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and political newcomer Pat Briody.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Finchem, who has still not accepted that he lost his bid for secretary of state in 2022 has the lead in a race against relative moderate Republican Ken Bennett for a state senate seat.\n\nIn Arizona's Maricopa county - which includes Phoenix - election deniers vied for positions that could give them oversight in future elections. Early results show a mixed bag for election-defending county officials.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, was behind in his race for reelection as of Tuesday night. He is falling behind Justin Heap, a state representative who will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughing stock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access and is in third.\n\nDebbie Lesko, an outgoing Republican congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January 2021, has a strong lead in the primary to join the county board of supervisors over another election denier, Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and recorder played a crucial role in 2020 standing up to pressure from Trump and his allies in their scheme to overturn the results of that year's presidential election.\n\nThe recorder and many board members have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. The pressure has remained intense in the lead-up to this year's elections, with errors such as printing problems in the 2022 election adding fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nAmid the threats and harassment, two supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election.\n\nFor Gates's seat, moderate former state lawmaker Kate Brophy McGee is far ahead in the primary against Tabatha LaVoie, who said on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because: \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is trailing far behind Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, is fending off a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\".\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state senator Raquel Ter\u00e1n is trailing in her primary for Arizona's third district, for the seat that will be vacated by Gallego. A longtime organiser against anti-immigrant laws in the state, T\u00e9ran focused her campaign on protecting abortion rights. Her main rival former city council member in Phoenix, Yassamin Ansari, had raised more funds and secured several key labour endorsements, and has the lead as of Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri":

What to know about US Senate and House races", "body": "PHOENIX - Hundreds of thousands of Arizonans had already cast their ballots as the sun rose on primary election day Tuesday, keeping with the state's decades-old practice of early voting.\n\nThe early votes -- and others cast in person at polling places Tuesday -- will determine the winners of several contentious intraparty battles and shape the November contests in key races. Polling places across the state will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. MST Tuesday.\n\nA high-profile GOP primary for a U.S. Senate seat lands at the top of the ticket that includes congressional, legislative and local races that will shape development and daily lives. Also at stake are top law enforcement and election administration roles in Maricopa, Pinal and other counties.\n\nIt's not just which candidate advances to November that could draw attention when the dust settles after the election.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. MST Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nA recap of everything: When is Arizona's primary? Election day is July 30. Here is a voter guide to help you learn about all the candidates.\n\nElection officials are operating under heightened concern about acts of political violence after the assassination attempt on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump just weeks ago. And there is a simmering skepticism, and added scrutiny, related to election administration.\n\nElections in Maricopa County especially are under the microscope after problems in recent cycles that have opened a window for those who cast doubt on election security. Printer problems at 30% of voting locations in 2022 led to confusion and long lines. And though the county had a contingency in place, some Republican leaders and candidates claimed voters were disenfranchised. An independent review found all ballots were counted, and judges dismissed claims that voters weren't able to cast ballots.\n\nArizona politics: Abe Hamadeh won't detail circumstances of loan that experts question\n\nWhile county officials say that no election is perfect, significant problems could fuel a flood of misinformation and further conspiracy theories.\n\n\"Although it's important to note that we're the most well-resourced, planned and trained that we've ever been, there's still no such thing as a perfect election,\" Zach Schira, assistant county manager for Maricopa County, told reporters last week. \"We're continually focused on creating backup plans because it is not possible to anticipate each and every issue that may occur during an election.\"\n\nThe Republican Party of Arizona and Maricopa County Republican Committee have already filed a lawsuit over pre-election testing of certain voting equipment, according to reporting by the Phoenix New Times.\n\nThe shooting of Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, and the intense political division in the nation, have led to new oversight and preparation measures.\n\n\"Considering the volatile political atmosphere and the conceivable risks of disruptions, our office will initiate vigilant monitoring activities from the early morning hours before the polls open and continue these efforts well into the night,\" said JP Martin, a spokesperson for Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, the top elections administrator in Arizona. That includes \"intensifying the scrutiny of misinformation\" and working with local law enforcement across the state to counteract potential threats, Martin said.\n\nA race pitting loyalists to Trump who are seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., tops the ticket, and who wins could help decide which party controls the chamber next year. Former television news anchor Kari Lake, who lost her statewide bid for governor in 2022 though she is still suing to overturn that result, is being challenged by Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. Arizona native Elizabeth Reye is running for the GOP nod, a longshot bid she acknowledges was to give voters another conservative option.\n\nFor seats in Congress, a crowded GOP race for the seat now occupied by Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., pits two Trump-loyal candidates who both lost statewide in November 2022 against a former congressman and two state lawmakers -- one of whom is facing criminal prosecution for certifying Trump won Arizona in 2020.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will choose between two progressives in a heated battle to represent a bright blue district held by U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is asking voters to elevate him to the U.S. Senate. And they'll consider a six-way race to determine who will put up a challenge to seven-term incumbent Republican Congressman David Schweikert.\n\nAll 90 state legislative seats are on the ballot this November, with a handful of challenges that could unseat incumbents. With just a few swing districts in play in November because of redistricting, who wins in the primary could help determine which party controls either chamber next year. Right now, Republicans have a slight majority.\n\nThis year's primary could significantly shift who runs elections in years to come.\n\nRepublican Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, who has defended elections in the face of attacks from Trump and Lake and others, is facing two primary challengers. Of five members of the Board of Supervisors, a body that stood up to Trump's and Trump allies' attempts to overturn the 2020 election result in Arizona, two Republicans aren't running again and two incumbents are facing viable challenges from within the GOP.\n\nAnd residents in over 20 Phoenix-area municipalities will cast their choice for mayors and town council leadership. Those will determine who helms growing cities like Scottsdale, Buckeye and Mesa, the people who make decisions for local residents about housing, transportation and growth. In Gilbert, a scandal involving violent and mostly affluent teens known as the Gilbert Goons has roiled the race for city leadership.\n\nThe first election results were expected to be reported Tuesday night.\n\nBut it may take days to count ballots, as is common in Arizona, and some winners may not be immediately clear. That is in part because voting patterns have shifted in recent years, and more voters dropping off ballots on election day can lead to delays.\n\nArizona's primary, slated for a sweltering summer day when many parts of the state are forecast to have temperatures in the triple digits, is slightly earlier than normal.\n\nState lawmakers and Gov. Katie Hobbs earlier this year enacted a law moving the election and other related deadlines forward by a week. They rushed the change because of concern that a 2022 law would lead to more automatic recounts that could delay results and disrupt later elections.\n\nReach reporter Stacey Barchenger at

Gallego had already dropped more than $15 million on advertisements in the lead-up to the primary, with an additional $18 million booked through November, according to ad tracker AdImpact. Gallego's ads have primarily been biographical, focusing on his story of growing up in a single-parent immigrant household and becoming a Marine.\n\nLake has taken a very different approach.\n\nOn the airwaves, she has gone aggressively after Gallego on immigration, typically seen as a weak spot for Democrats. (Gallego has sought to neutralize those attacks by proactively messaging on his work on the Southern border, a rarity for Democrats.) Most of her ad spending ahead of the primary -- $2 million -- has been in coordination with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which endorsed her, and the campaign has $6 million booked in future reservations.\n\nLake benefits from statewide name ID from her unsuccessful run in 2022 for governor. In that race, the former news anchor lost by less than 1 percentage point to Democratic now-Gov. Katie Hobbs, a result that Lake vehemently -- and baselessly -- denied long after the election.\n\nLake is still spreading false claims that the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen and railing against the \"fake news.\" When British journalist Emily Maitlis asked her earlier this month whether she would concede should she lose in November, Lake told her that she thinks Maitlis needs her \"head examined.\"\n\nAs Lake rose to prominence in 2022, she gained national attention as a close ally of and surrogate for former President Donald Trump -- enough to be considered a vice presidential contender at one point. Trump endorsed her in both her gubernatorial and Senate campaigns and took part in a tele-rally for Lake on the eve of Tuesday's primary.\n\nRepublicans have struggled in recent years to nominate Republican candidates in primaries -- where MAGA figures have dominated -- who are capable of winning a general election. In the midterms, the embrace of weak general election nominees led to smaller-than-expected gains for the GOP in Congress.\n\nThis year, the NRSC has had a heavy hand in recruiting candidates and clearing primary fields to elevate those they see as the most electable. The committee's strategy has worked in their favor so far -- with nominal competition in primaries that could have otherwise drained resources ahead of high-stakes general elections. In Arizona, as it became clear that Lake would have no serious primary competition, national Republicans coalesced around her in hopes of bringing her over the finish line come November.\n\nNow Lake is working to expand her appeal to a broader electorate and court establishment Republicans, some of whom are still skeptical of her following the hard-right profile she cultivated for herself just a couple of years ago. (Gallego, who has a progressive record that Republicans have sought to highlight, has also looked to cater to the center.)\n\nWith fewer than 100 days to go until Election Day, there are clear signs Lake still has plenty of work to do.\n\nLake proved to be a strong fundraiser in the aftermath of the 2022 election, raising millions as she dragged out unsuccessful litigation for months, claiming that the race was rigged against her. But now, she's lagging behind Gallego.\n\nAs of early July, Gallego had almost four times as much in his coffers compared with Lake, $8.2 million to $2.1 million. In the first 10 days of July, he raised more than $1 million, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. Lake brought in $325,000 during that period. Gallego also outraised her in the second quarter of this year, $10.5 million to $4.3 million.\n\nAnd messaging from allies of Lamb, who lost to Lake in the primary, could be a warning: \"Donald Trump needs a workhorse in the Senate, not a show horse,\" a spot from conservative group American Encore running in the lead-up to the primary said.\n\nGallego, a former state legislator, has been running for the Senate seat since early last year, when Sinema's candidacy was still a question hovering over the race. If elected, Gallego would be Arizona's first Latino senator.\n\nRepublicans have struggled statewide in Arizona in recent years. In 2022, Republican Blake Masters lost to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly by 5 points. Democrats also flipped the Senate seat in 2020 during a special election, and now-President Joe Biden narrowly clinched the state then, too.\n\nThe state is poised to again play a key role, both in the presidential election and determining control of the Senate. And it could take on an even higher-profile role should Vice President Kamala Harris choose Kelly as her running mate.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"},

But that's not even where most of the drama is happening in the swing state's primaries on Tuesday.\n\nKari Lake, who is backed by national Republicans as they look to flip the open Senate seat, is the heavy favorite in her primary. And her Democratic opponent, Rep. Ruben Gallego, is running uncontested, taking much of the intraparty intrigue out of what could be one of the most competitive Senate elections this year.\n\nInstead, some of the most contentious races in the Grand Canyon State are happening further down the ballot. In the GOP primary for the ruby red 8th District, an eleventh-hour endorsement from former President Donald Trump added another layer to an already bitter contest. The safe blue Phoenix-based seat being vacated by Gallego has attracted millions of dollars in outside spending. And a half-dozen Democrats are scrambling to take on longtime Republican Rep. David Schweikert in a district that President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020.\n\nHere are the races to watch on Tuesday:\n\n-- AZ-Sen: Lake is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination over Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, seen as her most serious competition, and another little-known candidate. Her competitors have failed to gain traction in the primary against the Trump ally, who has a strong standing among the MAGA base but is working to try to expand her appeal to the broader electorate.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to keep the seat after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema left the party to become an independent and chose not to run for reelection -- which could have scrambled the general election for both parties.\n\nIn light of a lack of serious competition on either side, campaigning in the lead-up to the primary has already shifted to the general election. Gallego has a substantial cash advantage over Lake: His campaign coffers are close to four times as large as hers as of early July, and from the beginning of the year through Tuesday, he has spent more than $15 million on advertising compared with $2 million from Lake and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which endorsed her, according to ad tracker AdImpact.\n\n-- AZ-01: Democrats have their sights set on Schweikert, who narrowly eked out a win in the midterms by less than 1 point. Biden won this battleground by around 2 points in 2020.\n\nThe busy field of Democrats looking to unseat Schweikert includes former Arizona Democratic Party Chair Andrei Cherny; former state Rep. Amish Shah; former journalist Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods; finance executive Conor O'Callaghan; orthodontist Andrew Horne; and former American Red Cross regional CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nThere isn't much public polling in this race, though Cherny, O'Callaghan (thanks to a hefty personal loan) and Gal\u00e1n-Woods have led the field in fundraising. The Democrats have leaned heavily on vows to protect abortion rights in their messaging -- especially in light of the state Supreme Court upholding the state's near-total abortion ban earlier this year, which was later repealed. Gal\u00e1n-Woods, the only woman in the race, has especially seized on that, and has emphasized her endorsements from EMILYs List and state Attorney General Kris Mayes. But she's also faced attacks over being a registered Republican until 2018.\n\n-- AZ-02: Rep. Eli Crane was one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy. But the former speaker's revenge tour doesn't seem to be making a stop in Arizona.\n\nCrane faces a primary challenge from Jack Smith, a former Yavapai County supervisor. Crane has sought to tie Smith to McCarthy, which the challenger has denied. McCarthy's affiliated groups have largely stayed out of the race, with the exception of an aligned nonprofit running a spot hitting Crane on immigration through the end of last month. Crane has far outpaced Smith in fundraising, a sign of Smith's lack of momentum. Another McCarthy detractor -- Rep. Andy Biggs in AZ-05 -- didn't even face a primary challenge.\n\n-- AZ-03: The Democratic primary to succeed Gallego has garnered plenty of national attention, with former Phoenix Vice Mayor Yassamin Ansari and former state Sen. Raquel Tera\u0301n emerging as the front-runners. The winner of the primary will be on a clear path to victory, given the Democratic lean of the seat.\n\nProtect Progress, a pro-crypto group that has spent in support of Democratic candidates nationally, has dropped more than $1 million backing Ansari. Tera\u0301n's campaign has taken issue with that spending, pointing to the group's prominent Republican donors. Ansari has also been boosted by pro-Israel DMFI PAC and Mainstream Democrats, a super PAC backed in part by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman that sought to tie Tera\u0301n to Republicans.\n\nTera\u0301n, meanwhile, has touted her progressive accolades, including support from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Planned Parenthood Action, the Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus' political arm is backing Tera\u0301n, who would be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress. She's also backed by Sen. Mark Kelly, one of the possible running mates for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n-- AZ-06: Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel are poised for a rematch after Engel lost to Ciscomani by around 1 point in the midterms. Engel is uncontested in the Democratic primary, though Ciscomani faces a nominal challenge from the right.\n\nThe general election for the 6th District is expected to be one of the most competitive House seats this year. Ciscomani is one of a handful of Republicans currently representing a seat that Biden won (which he did by less than 1 point) in 2020.\n\n-- AZ-08: Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh -- the failed 2022 Republican Senate and state attorney general candidates, respectively -- have been attacking each other for months in the bitter primary for this ruby red seat to replace retiring Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko.\n\nMasters and his allies have taken shots at Hamadeh by strongly implying he is Muslim. (Hamadeh has said he does not identify with any particular faith.) Masters and his supporters also ran ads featuring Trump's endorsement two years ago in the Senate race, which drew the ire of Hamadeh, whom Trump endorsed for this race back in December.\n\nBut the weekend before the election, Trump issued a rare double endorsement for both Masters and Hamadeh -- potentially neutralizing Hamadeh's perceived leg up in the primary, though many votes had already been cast by that point.\n\nA handful of other candidates are also running, including state House Speaker Ben Toma, who has the backing of outside groups like Americans for Prosperity Action, and former Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after female staffers said he approached them about being a surrogate for him and his wife, is on the ballot as well. It's possible that another candidate can find an opening as Masters and Hamadeh attack each other.\n\n-- Arizona state Legislature: The state legislative races are setting up to be among the most tense this cycle, with Democrats mounting an aggressive campaign to flip both chambers and Republicans dealing with sparring between the moderate and MAGA wings. Republicans hold a slim majority in both the state House and Senate.\n\nIn Arizona, 30 legislative districts are each represented by one state senator and two state representatives. And among the most contested is the 17th District, an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood in Tucson that is represented by Republicans but Democrats have made inroads in recent years. The GOP state Senate primary there is a close race between an incumbent and former incumbent -- and it's gotten ugly.\n\nState Sen. Justine Wadsack is defending her seat against Vince Leach, an incumbent whom she beat in 2022. Leach was a more traditional Republican who veered right on social issues toward the end of his tenure by pushing bills to ban children from attending drag shows. Wadsack, meanwhile, is a member of the Freedom Caucus and behind bills attempting to keep sexually explicit material out of school libraries.\n\nOn the Democratic side, two progressives are trying to oust a conservative Democrat, state Rep. Lydia Hernandez, in LD 24, a district with the highest concentration of Latino and Hispanic voters. Hernandez is on the outs with many Democrats after siding with Republicans on some issues like abortion and her support of former GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. She filed an ethics complaint against several fellow members of the Latino Caucus, accusing them of falsely imprisoning her and holding her hostage at a meeting over political differences. The state House Ethics Committee later dropped the complaint.\n\nMadison Fernandez reported from New York.

Ruben Gallego than most other Republicans seeking to switch control of Senate seats. Sen. Krysten Sinema, an independent who is not seeking reeelection, was elected as a Democrat.\n\n\"Heading into the General Election, Lake is currently in a stronger polling position than all other Senate candidates in competitive races except for Montana -- a state that Trump won by 16% in 2020 -- despite Gallego spending tens of millions of dollars during the primary,\" Lake's advisers said in the memo late Tuesday night.\n\nLake was ahead of Pima County Sheriff Mark Lamb by about 16 percentage points early Wednesday morning, with votes still being counted. The Associated Press called the race at 11:44 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.\n\nWith West Virginia's Republican Gov. Jim Justice expected to cruise to victory in the race to replace retiring Sen. Joe Manchin III -- an independent who, like Sinema, was elected as a Democrat -- the Lake campaign argues that only Republican Tim Sheehy in Montana is in a better position to flip a seat in terms of the margin between the Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLake's campaign memo, however, cites a RealClearPolitics polling average that showed Gallego ahead or tied in every poll in their collection of surveys since January. The memo also referenced an internal poll showing Lake with a lead that was within the margin of error.\n\nRepublicans would control the Senate if they flip a net of one seat and win the White House in November, since the vice president can break 50-50 ties. Flipping two or more seats would give them the majority regardless of how the presidential race goes.\n\nGallego's campaign, in a memo of its own, said, \"The bottom line: Kari Lake is the same candidate Arizonans rejected less than two years ago.\" Lake was the GOP nominee for governor during that cycle, narrowly losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\nThe Lake argument is, in part, that if former President Donald Trump prevails over Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election for president, it would be unlikely for the Senate race to go in a different direction, noting that Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is the only candidate who won in a state that backed for the opposite party's nominee for president in 2020. \"Ruben Gallego is no Susan Collins,\" the memo said.\n\nMany of the Arizona polls cited were conducted when President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee, and it may be too early to tell if the change at the top of the ticket has shifted those numbers. There is also a wild card: Arizona's other senator, Democrat Mark Kelly, is reportedly under consideration to be Harris' running mate.\n\nKelly defeated venture capitalist Blake Masters in the Senate race in 2022. Masters ran Tuesday in a wide-open House primary in Arizona's 8th District, but early returns showed him behind Abe Hamadeh in what might be the nastiest Republican primary of the year.\n\nThe Associated Press described that race as too early to call, citing uncounted votes cast on primary day, along with late-arriving mail ballots. The primary winner is on track to serve in the next Congress, replacing the retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. Lesko opted to run for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors.\n\nTrump and Lake initially endorsed Abe Hamadeh, while Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio backed Masters. In a late Saturday night post on Truth Social, however, Trump sought to hedge his bets in the race by amending his endorsement to back Masters as well.\n\nFormer state Rep. Amash Shah, a medical doctor, was ahead by less than 3 percentage points with an estimated 77 percent of the votes counted in the six-candidate Democratic primary to take on Rep. David Schweikert in Arizona's 1st District.\n\nThree other top candidates -- Andrei Cherny, Marlene Galen-Woods and Connor O'Callaghan -- were close behind Shah. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race for Schweikert's seat Tilt Republican.\n\nIn the open 3rd District, the race for the Democratic nomination to fill the seat being vacated by Gallego was likewise too early to call. Yassamin Ansari, a former member of the Phoenix City Council, had a lead of less than 4 points over Raquel Ter\u00e1n in a three-candidate race. Ter\u00e1n is another former state legislator who also used to chair the state's Democratic Party.\n\nOther races were not as close. In the 2nd District, Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., spent over $4 million and prevailed with nearly 80 percent of the vote, besting former Yavapai County Supervisor Jack Smith. Crane was among the Republicans who helped take down former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and at least one McCarthy-aligned group advertised against Crane.\n\nRep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., and his Democratic opponent from the last cycle, Kirsten Engel, a law professor and former member of both the state House and Senate, secured their respective party's nominations for a 2024 rematch in the Tucson area's 6th District. That race is also rated Tilt Republican by Inside Elections.\n\n\"Southern Arizonans see Representative Juan Ciscomani fighting every day to end the border crisis and the pain of inflation. Juan has earned his reputation for working across party lines to solve problems for Southern Arizona,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Ben Petersen said in a statement.\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene, the Washington Democrat who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in her own statement after the results were announced, \"Kirsten Engel is the pragmatic, solution-oriented leader that Arizonans deserve. Unlike Ciscomani, Kirsten isn't here to play partisan games, she wants to deliver results. That's why Southern Arizona will send her to Congress this November.\"\n\nEngel's primary was not contested, while Ciscomani was ahead with more than 60 percent of the vote after The Associated Press called the race, which came not long after Arizona began reporting results.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She'll face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego", "body": "Arizonans have chosen Kari Lake, an election denying ally of former President Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in a race that could determine control of the chamber this fall, according to a race call by The Associated Press.\n\nWith results from early voting reported, Lake led with roughly 53% of the GOP primary vote, well more than the roughly 41% held by her rival, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. and a distant third challenger, Elizabeth Jean Reye. Her margin of victory will likely change as more votes are counted.\n\nShe'll face Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, who ran unopposed for his party's nomination to the Senate seat now filled by retiring Sen. Krysten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLoading...\n\nLake has been a MAGA Republican ever since launching her political career with a failed campaign for governor of Arizona in 2022. While running for the Senate, Lake continues to deny her loss to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, and earlier this month filed yet another lawsuit seeking to have the outcome of that gubernatorial race overturned - and have herself instated as governor.\n\nHer persistent election denialism may have helped her receive the support of Trump, who swiftly endorsed Lake when she entered the U.S. Senate race last fall. But it's considered a weakness by some Arizona Republicans who worry she'll lose another statewide race this fall to Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran who's consistently led Lake in polls thus far.\n\nHer shifting position on abortion has also come under fire from Democrats in a state grappling with a ballot measure to enshrine the right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution this fall.\n\nIn April, Lake denounced an Arizona Supreme Court ruling reviving a near-total ban on abortion in the state -- a law she previously praised as a gubernatorial candidate, when she said she was \"thrilled\" Arizona would have the ban on the books in the event the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

A former news anchor, she will now face Representative Ruben Gallego, a Phoenix-area former Marine who had no opposition in the Democratic primary.\n\n\"Thank you for putting your faith in me, Arizona,\" Ms. Lake wrote on X. \"I won't let you down.\"\n\nMs. Lake and Mr. Gallego have already spent months attacking each other. The race has been essentially set -- Mr. Lamb's spoiler potential was the only question mark -- since March, when Ms. Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent, declared that she would not seek re-election.\n\nRunning in a border state, Ms. Lake has accused Mr. Gallego of being a far-left radical and favoring loose restrictions on immigration, while Mr. Gallego has blasted Ms. Lake for her shifting stance on abortion rights and for continuing to make baseless claims of election fraud. On Monday, he committed to debating Ms. Lake, while she expressed doubt about the debate host -- the state Clean Elections Commission -- but told reporters \"our teams can discuss a fair place, a fair platform to do that.\"\n\nAfter her victory, Mr. Gallego assailed her again, saying in a statement that he welcomed Arizonans \"to join our team and help defeat Kari Lake and her dangerous plan to ban abortion and hurt Arizonans.\"\n\nBoth candidates face questions about their ability to pull in independent voters and moderates heading into November, though Mr. Gallego has maintained a consistent, if narrow, lead in most surveys of the race and has a sizable fund-raising advantage.\n\nWhen Ms. Lake ran for governor in 2022 as a political newcomer, she roiled the Republican Party with an abrasive primary campaign. Her divisiveness and fervent embrace of former President Donald J. Trump's claims of election fraud helped Katie Hobbs, the Democrat, claim victory. After she lost, Ms. Lake filed a series of fruitless lawsuits, asserting without evidence that the election had been rigged against her.\n\nMore mainstream Republicans backed away from Ms. Lake as she continued her legal fights, but they returned to her side as she began her Senate campaign -- albeit with encouragement for her to tone down the stolen-election rhetoric. She has worked to mend fences with Republicans and keep her focus on issues like border crossings and the economy, even as she continues her effort to overturn the governor's race. She is also facing a defamation suit from an official in charge of overseeing elections in Maricopa County.\n\nMr. Gallego has sought to shed his longtime progressive label as he, too, courts Arizona's center. Democrats in the state have exploited Republican divisions to claim most statewide offices in recent years, but political observers suggest that Mr. Gallego, as an unabashed liberal, could have an uphill climb in attracting enough of the district's moderate Republicans to his side.\n\nRepublicans, with a buffet of vulnerable Democratic Senators to challenge, do not need the Arizona seat to reclaim the U.S. Senate. Although the National Republican Senatorial Committee has run advertisement in support of her campaign, it is unclear to what degree the party will continue to aid Ms. Lake.\n\n\"Arizonans must unite to defeat Ruben Gallego, one of the most radical Democrats in the country,\" Senator Steve Daines of Montana, the chair of the N.R.S.C., wrote in a statement congratulating Ms. Lake on Tuesday.",

What to know about US Senate, metro Phoenix races", "body": "Hundreds of thousands of Arizonans had already cast their ballots as the sun rose on primary election day Tuesday, keeping with the state's decades-old practice of early voting.\n\nThe early votes -- and others cast in person at polling places Tuesday -- will determine the winners of several contentious intraparty battles and shape the November contests in key races. Polling places across the state will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nA high-profile GOP primary for a U.S. Senate seat lands at the top of the ticket that includes congressional, legislative and local races that will shape development and daily lives. Also at stake are top law enforcement and election administration roles in Maricopa, Pinal and other counties.\n\nIt's not just which candidate advances to November that could draw attention when the dust settles after the election.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nElection officials are operating under heightened concern about acts of political violence after the assassination attempt on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump just weeks ago. And there is a simmering skepticism, and added scrutiny, related to election administration.\n\nElections in Maricopa County especially are under the microscope after problems in recent cycles that have opened a window for those who cast doubt on election security. Printer problems at 30% of voting locations in 2022 led to confusion and long lines. And though the county had a contingency in place, some Republican leaders and candidates claimed voters were disenfranchised. An independent review found all ballots were counted, and judges dismissed claims that voters weren't able to cast ballots.\n\nArizona politics: Abe Hamadeh won't detail circumstances of loan that experts question\n\nWhile county officials say that no election is perfect, significant problems could fuel a flood of misinformation and further conspiracy theories.\n\n\"Although it's important to note that we're the most well-resourced, planned and trained that we've ever been, there's still no such thing as a perfect election,\" Zach Schira, assistant county manager for Maricopa County, told reporters last week. \"We're continually focused on creating backup plans because it is not possible to anticipate each and every issue that may occur during an election.\"\n\nThe Republican Party of Arizona and Maricopa County Republican Committee have already filed a lawsuit over pre-election testing of certain voting equipment, according to reporting by the Phoenix New Times.\n\nThe shooting of Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, and the intense political division in the nation, have led to new oversight and preparation measures.\n\n\"Considering the volatile political atmosphere and the conceivable risks of disruptions, our office will initiate vigilant monitoring activities from the early morning hours before the polls open and continue these efforts well into the night,\" said JP Martin, a spokesperson for Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, the top elections administrator in Arizona. That includes \"intensifying the scrutiny of misinformation\" and working with local law enforcement across the state to counteract potential threats, Martin said.\n\nA race pitting loyalists to Trump who are seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., tops the ticket, and who wins could help decide which party controls the chamber next year. Former television news anchor Kari Lake, who lost her statewide bid for governor in 2022 though she is still suing to overturn that result, is being challenged by Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. Arizona native Elizabeth Reye is running for the GOP nod, a longshot bid she acknowledges was to give voters another conservative option.\n\nFor seats in Congress, a crowded GOP race for the seat now occupied by Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., pits two Trump-loyal candidates who both lost statewide in November 2022 against a former congressman and two state lawmakers -- one of whom is facing criminal prosecution for certifying Trump won Arizona in 2020.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will choose between two progressives in a heated battle to represent a bright blue district held by U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is asking voters to elevate him to the U.S. Senate. And they'll consider a six-way race to determine who will put up a challenge to seven-term incumbent Republican Congressman David Schweikert.\n\nAll 90 state legislative seats are on the ballot this November, with a handful of challenges that could unseat incumbents. With just a few swing districts in play in November because of redistricting, who wins in the primary could help determine which party controls either chamber next year. Right now, Republicans have a slight majority.\n\nThis year's primary could significantly shift who runs elections in years to come.\n\nRepublican Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, who has defended elections in the face of attacks from Trump and Lake and others, is facing two primary challengers. Of five members of the Board of Supervisors, a body that stood up to Trump's and Trump allies' attempts to overturn the 2020 election result in Arizona, two Republicans aren't running again and two incumbents are facing viable challenges from within the GOP.\n\nAnd residents in over 20 Phoenix-area municipalities will cast their choice for mayors and town council leadership. Those will determine who helms growing cities like Scottsdale, Buckeye and Mesa, the people who make decisions for local residents about housing, transportation and growth. In Gilbert, a scandal involving violent and mostly affluent teens known as the Gilbert Goons has roiled the race for city leadership.\n\nThe first election results were expected to be reported Tuesday night.\n\nBut it may take days to count ballots, as is common in Arizona, and some winners may not be immediately clear. That is in part because voting patterns have shifted in recent years, and more voters dropping off ballots on election day can lead to delays.\n\nArizona's primary, slated for a sweltering summer day when many parts of the state are forecast to have temperatures in the triple digits, is slightly earlier than normal.\n\nState lawmakers and Gov. Katie Hobbs earlier this year enacted a law moving the election and other related deadlines forward by a week. They rushed the change because of concern that a 2022 law would lead to more automatic recounts that could delay results and disrupt later elections.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType":

Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nWith 66% of the votes counted, Lake was projected to win the primary with 53.3% of the vote, according to The New York Times.

After her defeat to current Gov. Katie Hobbs, Lake challenged the results of that election as well, and accused the Democrats of perpetuating more mass voter fraud across the state. Lake filed multiple lawsuits attempting to overturn the election, none of which have proven successful.\n\nShe was later sued by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, who claims that the former gubernatorial hopeful made false statements about his conduct during the 2020 election -- which led to death threats.\n\nLake did not fight the suit and requested default judgment.

These general election losses in 2020 and 2022 ended decades-long Republican dominance, delivering the governor's office and other top spots to Democrats.\n\nThe results could foretell whether Arizonans, particularly Arizona Republicans, are ready to move on from election denialism and the far-right flank that controls the state party. And that lesson could carry into November in the swing state, which Biden narrowly won in 2020 in an upset.\n\nLake, who lost the governor's race in 2022, is now running for US Senate. She faces Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, but she is expected to win the Republican contest on Tuesday. The winner will face the Democratic representative Ruben Gallego. The seat is open after senator Kyrsten Sinema left the Democratic party and decided not to run for re-election, making it a top race to watch nationally for control of the chamber.\n\nGallego's run for Senate leaves a race for his House seat in a strong Democratic district, where the former state lawmaker Raquel Ter\u00e1n is facing the former Phoenix vice-mayor Yassamin Ansari.\n\nOther prominent Republicans who embraced election lies and lost their 2022 races are back in the mix now, too.\n\nAbe Hamadeh, who narrowly lost the attorney general election in 2022, is now in a crowded primary to fill the seat of Debbie Lesko, the Republican representative who will vacate congressional district 8.\n\nHamadeh has Trump and Lake's endorsements in the crowded field, though Trump made the late decision to also endorse Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel acolyte who lost in the US Senate race in 2022. Trump called Hamadeh and Masters \"two spectacular America First Candidates\".\n\n\"Blake Masters is a very successful businessman, and an incredibly strong supporter of our Movement to Make America Great Again - He is smart and tough! Likewise, Abe Hamadeh, a Veteran, former prosecutor, and fearless fighter for Election Integrity, has been with me all the way!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.\n\nThe primary field also includes Anthony Kern, senator and fake elector; Ben Toma, the speaker of the Arizona house; Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress after staffers claimed he asked them to serve as surrogates for him; and Pat Briody.\n\nMark Finchem, who lost his bid for secretary of state and still has not agreed he lost, is trying to return to the statehouse, running against a more moderate Republican, Ken Bennett, for a state senate seat.\n\nSeveral Maricopa county offices with primary elections include people who either say the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen or will not say whether they believe the elections were valid.\n\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa county recorder who became a nationally known voice for defending elections and sued Lake for defamation over election falsehoods, faces primary challengers who have questioned election results. Justin Heap, state representative, will not say whether he believes the 2020 or 2022 elections were stolen, but has called Maricopa county elections a \"laughingstock\" and supported bills that stemmed from election conspiracies. Another challenger, Don Hiatt, has said the 2020 election was stolen and wants to curtail voting access.\n\nThe Maricopa county board of supervisors and the recorder, which both play roles overseeing elections, stood up to intense pressure campaigns from Trump and his allies in 2020 and have faced ongoing threats, some of which have been prosecuted and led to prison sentences. Errors like printing problems in the 2022 election have added fuel to rightwing conspiracies.\n\nThe county primaries could land election deniers or skeptics into roles overseeing elections. Two of the supervisors, Bill Gates and Clint Hickman, decided not to run for re-election, in part because of the threats and harassment. This assures that the board will not have the same makeup next year.\n\nLesko, the congresswoman who is endorsed by Trump and voted to overturn election results on 6 January, is vying for Hickman's seat. She faces Bob Branch, a professor at the Christian college Grand Canyon University, who has spread false claims about elections, including the one where he lost a state superintendent race in 2018.\n\nFor Gates's seat, Kate Brophy McGee, a Republican former state lawmaker who, at times, voted against her party in the legislature, faces Tabatha LaVoie, who says on her campaign website that she wanted to restore voter confidence because \"Our County cannot continue to raise doubts about the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe two other Republican supervisors face primary challengers who are farther right, especially on election issues.\n\nJack Sellers, currently the board chair, is facing a challenge from Mark Stewart, currently a council member in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler. Stewart won't say whether he would have certified results in 2020 or 2022 and claims he will restore confidence in county elections.\n\nThomas Galvin, who was not on the board in 2020 but has defended county elections since taking office after beating election-denying candidates in 2022, will need to beat back a challenge from Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a a former state lawmaker and Lake-endorsed candidate who promised to \"fight for election integrity\" and \"take back Maricopa County from the establishment\". Ugenti-Rita faced accusations of sexual harassment from a female lobbyist after Ugenti-Rita claimed she was harassed by a state lawmaker who was ousted from the chamber over a pattern of harassment.\n\nIn the politically fraught state, some other races could also have widespread impact.\n\nDavid Schweikert, a longtime representative, has Republican challengers and a crowded Democratic primary in congressional district 1 because recent elections showed Schweikert to be vulnerable to a Democratic ouster.\n\nOn the right, Robert Backie and Kim George want to beat Schweikert, though he is expected to win the nomination. And on the left, contenders include Andrei Cherny, Marlene Galan-Woods, Andrew Horne, Kurt Kroemer, Conor O'Callaghan and Amish Shah.\n\nShawnna Bolick, a state senator who voted to repeal a territorial-era abortion ban and the wife of a state supreme court justice, will have to fend off a challenge from the right in what could be seen as a test for how Republican voters view abortion bans.\n\nAnother outspoken election denier, Wendy Rogers, is being challenged for her senate seat by David Cook, a relative moderate.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Meanwhile, her primary opponent, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, received 41% of the vote. Lake's victory was much narrower than expected, which could spell larger problems for Republicans in the Grand Canyon State, where voters have repeatedly rejected former President Donald Trump and the candidates he endorses in general elections.\n\nThe former news anchor will face Gallego, who is running unopposed, to replace Sinema who was elected in 2018 but left the Democratic Party last year to become an Independent. The Arizona senator considered running as an independent but ultimately opted against it in March.\n\nAfter receiving the endorsement of Trump and out-fundraising her competitors in the Republican race, Lake has focused her messaging on Gallego and the Biden administration. According to the last campaign finance report in early July, Lake had $2.1 million in cash-on-hand, in comparison to Lamb's $263,000.\n\nGallego has nearly $8.2 million on hand, according to campaign finance records. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates this race as lean Democratic.\n\nIn 2022, Lake ran for governor in the state as a hard-charging conservative outsider who was quick to turn on the GOP establishment -- and at the time, her campaign was one national Republicans kept at arm's length, worried about her electability in the battleground state. This cycle, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm endorsed Lake's candidacy in February.\n\nSince launching her campaign, she made some efforts to shift her most unpopular views, but they haven't been consistent. She criticized a near-total abortion ban in Arizona, but previously had called it a great law. Even after Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign arm, advised her to stay clear of election fraud claims; she hasn't listened.\n\nLake filed another appeal earlier this month asking the Arizona Supreme Court to declare her governor two years after she lost that election, despite her current run for the state's open Senate seat. Her attorneys filed a petition arguing the Superior Court and Court of Appeals should have reinstated her case over new evidence. Gallego is leading by 3.4 points in an average of polling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSince Sinema's victory in 2018, Arizona has transformed from a solid red state to one of the country's most competitive battlegrounds.\n\nIn 2020, Biden's victory in the state over Trump helped him secure the White House. In December 2020, Arizona had two Democratic senators for the first time since 1952 after Mark Kelly was sworn in. In 2022, Lake and three other Republicans running for major statewide offices lost. It was the first time Democrats held all major statewide positions since 1950.\n\nArizona was the only state in the 2022 midterm elections where Republicans running for top positions had all embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. All of those candidates lost to their Democratic opponents in the vote count.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Polls in Arizona closed at 10:00 p.m. ET, but the first results aren't expected to be reported until after 11:00 p.m. ET.

Her main intraparty competition comes from Mark Lamb, a Pinal County sheriff, who trailed Lake by double-digits in the latest poll leading up to Tuesday's primary. Lake, polling at 50 percent and vastly out-raising Lamb, is considered the favorite to win the race and take on Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego in November.\n\nIn the House primaries, the crowded Republican field seeking to replace retiring GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko in the 8th Congressional District has two Trump-endorsed candidates: Blake Masters, who mounted an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in the midterms, and Abe Hamadeh, who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in 2022.\n\n\"They will both be spectacular, and I'm pleased to announce that both Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh have my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona's 8th Congressional District,\" Trump said in a recent post on Truth Social. \"THEY WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!\"\n\nMasters also landed JD Vance's endorsement before the senator was chosen as Trump's running mate, and has a significant fundraising lead over Hamadeh.\n\nAcross the aisle, Democrats have a crowded six-way primary race of their own in the 1st Congressional District where party bosses see a potential chance to unseat incumbent GOP Rep. David Schweikert who narrowly won the competitive district in the last cycle. Five of the Democrats running to challenge Schweikert raised more than $1 million already with resumes ranging from businessmen to former TV anchors to former state lawmakers.\n\nIn addition, the Democrat primary for the 3rd Congressional District -- left open by current Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego who's now running for U.S. Senate after incumbent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema became an independent and decided not to run for reelection -- has two front-runners hoping to lock up the nomination and coast to an easy victory in the district that went 75 percent

Kyrsten Sinema, who was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but became an independent in 2022 after years of bucking her party on key votes. Sinema faced a tough road to reelection after U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego launched his bid for the Democratic nomination in 2023, raising the specter of a three-way general election in the competitive swing state. She announced in March she wouldn't seek a second term. Gallego is unopposed in Tuesday's primary.\n\nIn the Republican primary, ex-2022 gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake faces Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lake launched her campaign in October while still contesting the results of her failed bid for governor and has largely looked beyond the primary, skipping a debate and focusing her campaign messaging on Gallego and President Joe Biden. She has outpaced the field in fundraising and received the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nPeople are also reading...

David Schweikert is the front-runner in his Republican primary against businessman Robert Backie and ex-FBI agent and corporate investigator Kim George. The field in the Democratic primary includes ex-state party chair and 2010 state treasurer nominee Andrei Cherny, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, orthodontist Andrew Horne, ex-regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer, investment banker Conor O'Callaghan and ex-state Rep. Amish Shah.\n\nSchweikert led both fields in campaign fundraising. Cherny raised the most through the end of June among Democrats. O'Callaghan began the month with slightly more money in the bank than Cherny, thanks in large part to $905,000 he loaned his campaign.\n\nCherny, an ex-Clinton White House speechwriter, has the ex-president's backing and that of Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. Gal\u00e1n-Woods' endorsements include ex-governor and Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, state Attorney General Kris Mayes and Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva from the 7th Congressional District. O'Callaghan boasts endorsements from three members of Congress outside Arizona and \"Grey's Anatomy\" actor Kate Walsh.\n\nIn the 6th Congressional District, Rep. Juan Ciscomani must face two rematches before he can claim a second term. First, he must fend off a challenge from fellow Republican Kathleen Winn, who placed third in the 2022 primary for this seat. If he wins the primary as expected, he'd again face Democrat Kirsten Engel, who received more than 49% of the vote against Ciscomani in 2022.\n\nThe rest of Arizona's congressional districts are generally less competitive, although some feature notable primary matchups.\n\nIn the 2nd Congressional District, first-term Republican Rep. Eli Crane faces a primary challenge from Jack Smith, a former Yavapai County Board of Supervisors member. Crane was among eight U.S. House Republicans who voted to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker in 2023. Crane's fellow Arizona Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, in the 5th Congressional District, also voted to oust McCarthy but is unopposed in his primary.\n\nIn the state Legislature, Republicans hold the narrowest of majorities in both chambers. In the general election, Democrats will try to take over the state Senate for the first time since 1992 and the state House for the first time since 1966, the last time the party controlled the governorship and both chambers simultaneously.\n\nTuesday's primaries were originally scheduled for Aug. 6, but the Legislature changed the date to allow counties more time to tally votes in the event of an automatic recount.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect Tuesday:\n\nPrimary day\n\nAll polls close at 7 p.m. local time, meaning most of the state closes at 10 p.m. ET. Vote results won't be available until 11 p.m. ET. Unlike most of the state, the Navajo Nation observes daylight saving time, so polls there close at 9 p.m. ET, affecting parts of three counties in the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nWhat's on the ballot\n\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in contested primaries for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, state Senate, state House and some local offices: county attorney, county recorder and county supervisor in Maricopa County and county attorney and sheriff in Pima County.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nRegistered party members may vote only in their own party's primary. Independent or unaffiliated voters may participate in either primary.\n\nDecision notes\n\nThe most pivotal county in Arizona elections is Maricopa, which is home to Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa and contributed more than 60% of the vote in the 2022 governor's race. Pima County was a distant second, just shy of 16% of the vote.\n\nEight of Arizona's nine congressional districts include parts of Maricopa County, with the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 8th districts falling within its boundaries. Crane's 2nd Congressional District contains only a small sliver of Maricopa. Instead, Yavapai, Pinal and Coconino tend to be the decisive counties in that district.\n\nCiscomani's 6th District is the only congressional seat unaffected by the Maricopa vote. Pima County is the largest source of votes there.\n\nIn state House primaries, voters may select up to two candidates, and the AP will declare two winners per contest. The AP will tabulate write-in votes cast in the Republican primary for state House District 29, which may delay determining the winner.\n\nThe AP doesn't make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there's no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race hasn't been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, like candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear it hasn't declared a winner and explain why.\n\nIn Arizona, recounts are automatic if the vote margin is 0.5% of the total vote or less. The AP may declare a winner in a race that's eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of April, there were nearly 4.1 million registered voters in Arizona. Of those, about 35% were Republicans and 29% were Democrats.\n\nIn the 2022 midterm primaries, turnout was nearly 13% of registered voters in the Democratic primaries and about 18% in the Republican primaries. Arizona has an \"Active Early Voting List\" program where participating eligible voters are automatically sent a mail ballot. About 93% of Democratic primary voters and 79% of Republican primary voters cast their ballots before primary day in 2022.\n\nAs of Tuesday, nearly 696,000 ballots had been cast ballots before primary day, about 45% in the Democratic primary and about 54% in the Republican primary.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2022 midterm primaries, the AP first reported results at 11:01 p.m. ET, about one minute after polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 7:11 a.m. ET with about 77% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 98 days until the November general election.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Ballot counting will continue Wednesday. Former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide. But primaries in three congressional races, a trio of noteworthy state legislative contests and the Republican contest for Maricopa County recorder featuring incumbent Stephen Richer who pushed back hard against election falsehoods were too early to call. Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters led a field of six candidates vying for the GOP nomination in Arizona's 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn legislative races, abortion politics made one Republican particularly vulnerable.\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nState Rep. Justin Heap and Richer were in a tight race in the GOP primary for Maricopa county recorder, with thousands of mail-in ballots still to be counted over the next week or so. Information technology professional Donald Hiatt trailed in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated

She lost multiple legal challenges to the election results in her own gubernatorial race in 2022 and has not yet admitted defeat in that race.\n\nJust last month she lost an appeals court challenge to the race arguing that thousands of Phoenix-area mail ballot signatures were not properly verified.\n\nLake has since disavowed some of her previously held hard-right views, particularly on abortion.\n\nShe spoke out against the revival of a Civil War-era abortion ban in her state, one she'd previously hailed as a 'great law.' The law, which has since been repealed, prohibited the procedure at all stages of pregnancy except to save the life of the mother.\n\nHer campaign website says she 'does not support a federal ban on abortion' and she's expressed support for the state law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks.\n\nake greets members of the press before casting her ballot at Paradise Valley Town Hall during the Arizona state primary election,\n\nBikini-clad Kari Lake swaps Mar-a-Lago for the Bahamas for vacation with her family\n\nRead More How J.D.

First on that list is Donald J. Trump; second is Kari Lake.'\n\n'They're coming after us with lawfare, they're going to come after us with everything.

Justin Heap, a critic of Arizona's voting operations in 2020 and 2022 has unseated Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer in the Republican primary. Elsewhere, Primary Election Day in Arizona without many of the top races being decided. Ballot counting will continue Wednesday. Former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide. But primaries in three congressional races and a trio of noteworthy state legislative contests were too close to call. Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters led a field of six candidates vying for the GOP nomination in Arizona's 8th Congressional District. In legislative races, abortion politics made one Republican particularly vulnerable. Here's a look at some key races: Maricopa County Heap, a Mesa lawmaker seized on the first opportunity to unseat election officials who knocked down false claims about the two most recent elections. The AP called the race for Heap early Wednesday. He defeated both Richer, the incumbent, and challenger Donald Hiatt in the GOP primary in the Maricopa County recorder's race. Richer, who took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent, was known for pushing pushed back against falsehoods about Arizona's 2020 and 2022 elections. Heap will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the Nov. 5 general election. The county recorder runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county. Heap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republicans voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Like Hiatt, Heap said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots. US House 8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results. Whoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020. Ex-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00c3\u00a1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer. One of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee. Schweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George. 3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00c3\u00a1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix. Ansari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\"\u009d and defend abortion rights. Ter\u00c3\u00a1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination. Arizona Legislature Senate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple. Senate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water. Senate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Justin Heap, a critic of Arizona's voting operations in 2020 and 2022 has unseated Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer in the Republican primary.\n\nElsewhere, Primary Election Day in Arizona without many of the top races being decided. Ballot counting will continue Wednesday. Former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide. But primaries in three congressional races and a trio of noteworthy state legislative contests were too close to call. Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters led a field of six candidates vying for the GOP nomination in Arizona's 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn legislative races, abortion politics made one Republican particularly vulnerable.\n\nHeap, a Mesa lawmaker seized on the first opportunity to unseat election officials who knocked down false claims about the two most recent elections. The AP called the race for Heap early Wednesday.\n\nHe defeated both Richer, the incumbent, and challenger Donald Hiatt in the GOP primary in the Maricopa County recorder's race.\n\nRicher, who took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent, was known for pushing pushed back against falsehoods about Arizona's 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nHeap will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThe county recorder runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republicans voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Like Hiatt, Heap said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon

On Monday, just a day before the state's primaries, her campaign and supporters received a call from Donald Trump.\n\nTrump called to encourage listeners to back Lake, but also to recite his litany of grievances. He told listeners that Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race was a \"coup\" by Democrats, the Arizona Republic reports. He mdae his call as Arizonans head to the poll today for their primary election.\n\nThe former president also complained about the media, pressed his \"drill, baby drill\" energy message, and voiced his intent to end taxes on tipped earnings.\n\nTrump told listeners on the call that Lake was \"as good as you can get.\"\n\n\"She's fantastic. She will not let us down,\" Trump said. \"Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nLake will face off against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Jean Reye in Tuesday's Republican primary. The winner will face congressman Ruben Gallego, who is running unopposed in his primary. The race will fill the seat left open by retiring Senator Krysten Sinema.\n\nLake is considered to be the favorite for the GOP primary, according to the Arizona Republic. She has already secured Trump's endorsement and has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as well as most of the Republican senators who would serve as her colleagues if she wins.\n\nGroups backing Lake have already spent approximately $140,000 to boost her primary chances. Democrats have spent $800,000 fighting against her.\n\nDuring the call -- which lasted approximately 15 minutes -- Trump insisted that Lake was the best candidate for securing the US' southern border with Mexico.\n\n\"She's fearless when it comes to being a champion for the common-sense, America-first policies. Kari will vote to seal the border,\" he said. \"We're going to seal that border. It will stop them immediately, and that will stop, in turn, the invasion, the largest invasion in the history of probably any country.

She also brings a nationally recognized reputation for election denialism and unfailingly attacks the media as \"fake news.\"\n\nPinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb offers a lower-key brand of Trump fealty that raises many of the same issues as Lake but with a measure of elective success, a dearth of cash and less hostility to the media covering a race that could help determine control of the U.S. Senate next year.\n\nParadise Valley neuroscientist Elizabeth Jean Reye casts herself as a Republican in the mold of former President Ronald Reagan and is also in the race to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nGallego is unchallenged for the Democratic nomination and has generally led in polling and cash for months.\n\nLake has held the spotlight for most of the race, drawing national attention and resources that have underscored her closeness to Trump while also finding herself in the center of repeated controversies.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nLake entered the race in October after months of anticipation that she would do so. She did so even as she continued to sue to overturn her 2022 gubernatorial loss to Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and as she was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential pick for Trump.\n\nLake served as a prominent surrogate for Trump's campaign ahead of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nBut in January, on the day he won New Hampshire and seemingly ended notions of a prolonged battle with former Ambassador Nikki Haley, a secret recording of Lake's conversation 10 months earlier with Jeff DeWit, the chair of the Arizona Republican Party, published in London's Daily Mail.\n\nDeWit delivered a message that influential people wanted Lake to not run for office in 2024 and asked her to name her price to stay out. Lake refused what she considered a bribe, and DeWit, a staunch Trump loyalist, resigned from his position the day after the recording became public.\n\nIn April, Lake said an Arizona Supreme Court ruling upholding a 19th-century near-total ban on abortions was \"out of step with Arizonans.\" It marked a reversal for Lake on the 1864 law that she vigorously cheered in 2022, and Lake faced disappointment from conservatives who viewed her new position a surrender on the issue.\n\nLake alternately said she was only facing a political reality that those who support abortion rights would capitalize on the ruling and also said county sheriffs should enforce the ban.\n\nIn May, Lake appeared at a campaign event at a Trump-themed store in Window Rock and spoke with a Confederate battle flag clearly in view behind her, sparking another round of outrage from her more progressive critics.\n\nThroughout, Lake generally ignored Lamb. She didn't mention him by name and focused on Gallego and Sinema until she quit the race.\n\nDuring an online candidate forum in May, Lake called Lamb \"a total coward\" on the issue of election integrity in a comment that drew a rebuke from most of the state's sheriffs.\n\nBut Lamb, who entered the race in April 2023, never seemed to fully capitalize as an alternative to Lake. His fundraising was anemic, and he couldn't compete for Lake's stable of top-tier GOP endorsements.\n\nHis differences with Lake tended to be stylistic only.\n\nLamb unambiguously said he supported the 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. He agrees with Lake's contention that Biden didn't fairly get 81 million votes in the 2020 election but conceded there was no credible evidence of fraud in his county.\n\nReye found all the talk of election fraud a political dead end and said she decided to run as a Reagan-style Republican as an alternative to election denialism.\n\nThe Green Party primary also ends Tuesday, with more interest than usual.\n\nWrite-in candidate Eduardo Quintana is endorsed by party officials, but he faces challenges from two men who qualified for the ballot: Mike Norton, a candidate with ties to Democrats, and Arturo Hernandez, a candidate with ties to Republicans.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com",

Ballot counting will continue Wednesday. Former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide. But primaries in three congressional races, a trio of noteworthy state legislative contests and the Republican contest for Maricopa County recorder featuring incumbent Stephen Richer who pushed back hard against election falsehoods were too early to call. Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters led a field of six candidates vying for the GOP nomination in Arizona's 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn legislative races, abortion politics made one Republican particularly vulnerable.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nMaricopa County\n\nState Rep. Justin Heap and Richer were in a tight race in the GOP primary for Maricopa county recorder, with thousands of mail-in ballots still to be counted over the next week or so. Information technology professional Donald Hiatt trailed in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri":

I know you've missed our Tuesdays together as much as I have. To make up for it, we have primaries today and Thursday this week. That's how much we care.\n\nToday, we're heading down to Arizona for House and Senate primaries. There are some interesting races to watch in the Grand Canyon State, and we'll start with the Senate.\n\nOn the Democrat side, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is running unopposed, so he'll cruise through to the general. His entry into the race was reportedly what prompted Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) to choose not to seek re-election.\n\nIn the GOP contest, former news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake faces off against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lake has led in the polls -- although her overall lead has narrowed -- and she's spent much of the race looking beyond the primary to attacking Gallego and the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nTwo House races look to be close contests going into November. In the 1st District, Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) faces businessman Robert Backie and FBI agent-turned-corporate investigator Kim George in his quest for an eighth term. The GOP winner will face the victor in a crowded Democratic field. In the 6th District, freshman Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) faces the GOP challenger he took in 2022, and if he wins, he'll face the same Democrat he beat two years ago.\n\nWhile the Democrats have their eyes on winning those districts, the rest of Arizona's districts aren't as hotly contested. Democrats are also trying to take over both chambers of the state legislature.\n\nIn addition to the congressional and state legislative races, there's a statewide race for Corporation Commissioner. Polls will close in Arizona at 10 p.m. Eastern, except for the Navajo Nation, where polls will close at 9 p.m.\n\nCheck back here for the most up-to-date results, thanks to our friends at Decision Desk HQ.

Justin Heap, a critic of Arizona's voting operations in 2020 and 2022 has unseated Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer in the Republican primary.\n\nElsewhere, Primary Election Day in Arizona without many of the top races being decided. Ballot counting will continue Wednesday. Former Phoenix television news anchor and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb in a Republican U.S. Senate primary that headlined the election statewide. But primaries in three congressional races and a trio of noteworthy state legislative contests were too close to call. Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters led a field of six candidates vying for the GOP nomination in Arizona's 8th Congressional District.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIn legislative races, abortion politics made one Republican particularly vulnerable.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's a look at some key races:\n\nMaricopa County\n\nHeap, a Mesa lawmaker seized on the first opportunity to unseat election officials who knocked down false claims about the two most recent elections. The AP called the race for Heap early Wednesday.\n\nHe defeated both Richer, the incumbent, and challenger Donald Hiatt in the GOP primary in the Maricopa County recorder's race.\n\nRicher, who took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent, was known for pushing pushed back against falsehoods about Arizona's 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nHeap will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThe county recorder runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republicans voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Like Hiatt, Heap said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri":

Ruben Gallego", "body": "PHEONIX -- Kari Lake has won Arizona's Republican Senate primary, defeating Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and Elizabeth Reye.\n\nLake, a former Phoenix-area television news anchor and Republicans' 2022 gubernatorial nominee, was favored to win the primary with a significant lead in most polls.\n\nHer victory sets up a general election contest with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who ran unopposed in the Democratic Senate primary.\n\nGallego's victory was called shortly after the polls closed at 7:00 p.m. local time. The Associated Press called Lake's victory in the primary at 8:44 p.m. local time.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. local time, Lake had won 53.3 percent of the vote, according to the Associated Press, and carried all but two counties in the state. Lamb had 40.7 percent as of that same time, while Reye had 6.1 percent.\n\nLake and Gallego are seeking to replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who is not seeking reelection. Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018 but left the party after the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nMatthew Martinez, who leads the legal ballot-chasing effort for conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action, lauded Lake's win.\n\n\"This is a good victory... but we have to win our general,\" Martinez told The Epoch Times.\n\nSenators from Arizona, a battleground state, have often received a spotlight in national politics. The late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ran for president in 2000, where he was then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush's primary opponent, and in 2008, when he won the nomination but was defeated in the general election by then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.).\n\nMcCain later attracted national prominence for his criticism of then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016 and, later, during his presidency. McCain himself succeeded the late Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), who was the Republican nominee in the 1964 presidential election against President Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater later played a key role in defense policy and is often regarded as a pivotal figure in the conservative movement.\n\nArizona's other senator, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), is named as a possible running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nLake said she didn't want to work with the debate commission, citing her treatment during the 2022 midterms.\n\n\"We've seen how they treated people the last election cycle back in 2022, where people who decided not to do the debate, namely Hobbs, ended up getting her own half-an-hour. That was my problem,\" Lake told reporters on July 30.\n\nShe indicated that her campaign would consult with Gallego about a possible debate in another forum.\n\n\"I don't understand why Kari Lake is afraid of an even, grounded debate,\" Gallego told The Epoch Times.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrsten Sinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turning Point Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Goldwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Vance is a a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of tech billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nIf the numbers hold, Hamadeh, who lives in Scottsdale, will have a job for life in this solidly Republican West Valley congressional district -- no small feat given Masters' money and his full-on assault targeting Hamadeh's family, his ethnic background and even his status as an unmarried, childless adult.\n\nAs for Lake, she needed to win 60% of the vote to show she can unify Republicans in a way that she was unable to do in 2022, when she lost the governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\n\"If (Pinal County Sheriff Mark) Lamb gets 35% to 40%, that's a huge problem for Lake,\" Republican consultant Barrett Marson told me, before the polls closed.\n\nA big chunk of GOP picked someone not named Lake\n\nWith a large swath of the votes counted, the underfunded, hardly noticed Lamb had 40% of the vote though he's likely to lose some ground as election day votes are counted. Lake stood at 54% late Tuesday -- a disappointing number given that she was the presumptive Republican nominee even before she announced she was running for the Senate and endorsed by Trump soon after.\n\nLake needed 60% of the GOP vote to show the D.C. money crowd that she can be competitive against Democrat Ruben Gallego. That she can unite Republicans in a way that no MAGA candidate has been able to do since 2018, resulting in the loss of not one but two Senate seats to Democrats.\n\n\"Lake's underwhelming numbers are a bad sign for her general election,\" Republican consultant Tyler Montague told me.\n\nMixed results for MAGA in Maricopa County races\n\nElsewhere, it was a mixed bag in the battle between MAGA and traditional Republican candidates.\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor Tom Galvin is handily defeating his MAGA opponent, former Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita in the northeast Valley.\n\nBut in the East Valley, Supervisor Jack Sellers lost to his MAGA opponent, termed-out Chandler Councilman Mark Stewart. That may open the door for Democrat Joel Navarro in November, given the political makeup of this district.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell rolled over her Lake-endorsed opponent, Gina Godbehere.\n\nBut Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer looks to be in trouble, trailing his MAGA-supported opponent, Rep. Justin Heap.\n\nBut traditional Republicans in statehouse took a drubbing\n\nIn the Legislature, meanwhile, it's shaping up to be a disastrous night for traditional Republicans, as one of the state's loudest election deniers, former Rep. Mark Finchem, appears to have carpetbagged his way into a Senate seat in ruby red Yavapai County, defeating the more moderate Sen. Ken Bennett.\n\nHard-right Sen. Wendy Rogers is headed to a third term, defeating the term-limited Rep. David Cook.\n\nIn Pima County, the jury's still out on the battle royale between the hard-right Sen. Justine Wadsack and former Sen. Vince Leach. Leach has pulled into an oh-so-slim lead, but it's too close to know whether he will regain the Senate seat he lost to Wadsack in 2022.

Justin Heap and Richer were in a tight race in the GOP primary for Maricopa county recorder, with thousands of mail-in ballots still to be counted over the next week or so. Information technology professional Donald Hiatt trailed in the first opportunity to unseat an election official who knocked down false claims about the 2020 and 2022 elections.\n\nRicher, whose office runs voter registration and early-voting efforts in the state's most populous county, took office in early 2021 after unseating a Democratic incumbent.\n\nHe drew heavy criticism in some conservative circles for calling out former President Donald Trump and others for falsehoods about the 2020 election, which Joe Biden won in Arizona by 10,457 votes.\n\nRicher was later criticized by Lake, who claimed her defeat in the 2022 governor's race was due to election fraud. Even though her legal challenges were rejected by the courts, Lake continues to claim that Richer and other Maricopa County officials interfered in the election to prevent her from winning.\n\nRicher later filed a defamation lawsuit against Lake, saying he faced \"violent vitriol and other dire consequences\" because of lies spread by Lake, including death threats and the loss of friendships.\n\nHeap stops short of saying the 2020 and 2022 elections were stolen but said thousands of Republican voters don't have faith in the county's election operations. Both Heap and Hiatt have said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nRicher said he has done his best to defend the integrity of the election system in the face of falsehoods, has worked to clean up voter rolls and has been on the winning side of lawsuits that challenge election results.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face the race's lone Democrat, attorney Tim Stringham, in the November election.\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

She will not let us down,\" Trump said. \"Kari Lake, I just think she's going to be as good as you can get. There's nobody going to be better.\"\n\nThe call came as voting in Arizona's primary election ends Tuesday and as Republican voters choose between Lake, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Jean Reye.\n\nThe winner will face Democratic contender Ruben Gallego, who is unopposed for his party's nomination in the race to replace the retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz.\n\nLake is widely viewed as the GOP primary favorite, with Trump's early endorsement, as well as the backing of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and most of the Republican senators she hopes to join.\n\nLamb has run a low-budget, low-profile campaign. It picked up nearly $350,000 in supportive spending from the conservative organizations American Encore and Secure Arizona's Future.\n\nBy contrast, Lake-aligned groups have spent about $140,000 to help her in the primary and Democratic-aligned organizations have spent more than $800,000 against her so far.\n\nTrump's call, which lasted less than 15 minutes, served as a mini-rally of sorts for a candidate he backed from the October night she formally entered the race.\n\nHe mixed in complaints against the media, outlined his own agenda of \"drill, baby drill\" to bring about lower energy prices, eliminating income tax on tips and, of course, closing America's borders.\n\n\"She's fearless when it comes to being a champion for the common-sense, America-first policies. Kari will vote to seal the border,\" he said. \"We're going to seal that border. It will stop them immediately, and that will stop, in turn, the invasion, the largest invasion in the history of probably any country. There's never been anything like it.\"\n\nTrump ripped Gallego, calling the five-term member of Congress \"an open-border zealot.\"\n\nTrump lingered over Harris ascending on the presidential ticket for a moment as well.\n\n\"It looks like they did a coup with respect to (President Joe) Biden. He got 14 million votes, and they threw him out,\" Trump said of his former opponent.\n\nEndorsing rivals: Donald Trump praises Blake Masters in rare last-minute dual endorsement for Congress\n\n\"They said, 'We're getting you out. You're either going to do it the nice way or you're gonna do it the hard way.' And he's gone. It's like a prize fight. ... You have a fighter and he's not doing well. They say, 'That's OK, let's throw another fighter into the ring.'\" Trump said. \"That's what they did with Kamala, but she's actually worse. She's actually worse than he is. But Kari is going to be a tremendous help and she'll be voting with us all the way down the line on energy independence and everything else.\"\n\nTrump said Gallego, whose name he also mispronounced, \"is an ultra-left, I mean this, is an ultra-left winger, radical Democrat extremist.\n\n\"He's a guy that's not respected. He's not respected there. People don't listen to him,\" Trump continued. \"They don't take him seriously, and from what I understand, Kari, the polls are very good.\"\n\nPublic polling in the race since Sinema quit the race in

She needs to blow Lamb's cowboy hat into the next time zone.\n\n\"If Lamb gets 35% to 40%, that's a huge problem for Lake,\" Republican consultant Barrett Marson told me.\n\nEven before Lake jumped into the race, Lake was considered the presumptive Republican nominee. She snagged endorsements from Donald Trump and most of the D.C. Republican establishment and grabbed all the oxygen in the race.\n\nIn Arizona, though, she has a likeability problem.\n\nTurns out that stake shoved into the hearts of McCain Republicans -- as Lake jubilantly crowed after winning the Republican 2022 gubernatorial primary -- is not so easily removed.\n\nBut it's not only the more moderate Republicans who dislike her. Pollsters and political consultants tell me Lake's image problem is spread across the Republican ideological spectrum.\n\nTo have any chance in November, she's got to show she can pull a deeply divided Republican Party together in July.\n\nShe needs to score at least 60% of the vote Tuesday.\n\nThat's the golden number that political analysts are looking for -- a decisive win that would prove Lake can consolidate the Republican vote and be competitive against Democrat Ruben Gallego.\n\n\"Anything less than 60 and the narrative will be 'underfunded candidate gets (insert number) against Trump endorsed Lake'...,\" one Republican operative told me. \"I think she needs at least 57-58 (percent) to be able to manage perception.\"\n\nThat perception being that she can't beat Gallego.\n\nKari Lake can win? Not with this firebrand as a friend\n\nThat a large swath of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents just won't vote for her come November.\n\nYou saw it in the 2022 gubernatorial election when Lake got 1.27 million votes, losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes. But Arizona's Republican state Treasurer Kimberly Yee drew nearly 1.4 million votes in that same election -- nearly 120,000 more than Lake.\n\nA fair number of Republicans either held their nose and voted for Hobbs, or they just left the race blank.\n\nWhich brings us back to Tuesday's primary, where Lake needs to show that she can win over those voters.\n\nIf she polls at 60%, it's on.\n\nUnfortunately for Lake, I didn't talk to anyone who thinks she'll get anywhere close to 60%.\n\n\"She's going to be between 51 and 55,\" longtime Republican strategist Chuck Coughlin predicted. \"That's going to be the epitaph on the tombstone of her campaign's grave.\n\n\"If she's not in the high 50s or low 60s, it's Fat Tuesday for her.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lamb (sheriff)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinal_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinal County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_California_gubernatorial_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 California gubernatorial election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Yee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Hobbs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LXOVMUUcxx0H5y2KK_Ehww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/azcentral-the-arizona-republic/b14c0257bf04a3b1b323386a490cc5e1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775014", "eventUri": "eng-9775014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

David Schweikert is on the ropes, and six candidates are squaring off in a primary to determine who will face him. Former campaign friends have become enemies in the fight for Arizona's West Valley congressional seat, as a six-way contest has been dominated by mudslinging and personal attacks.\n\nIn the state's northeastern reaches, voters will help decide a bitter rivalry that involves one of D.C.'s top power brokers. And in a Phoenix-area Democratic primary, it's a jump ball between a climate policy wunderkind touting her record as a city councilmember and a longtime community organizer endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.\n\nAll the races have been hard-fought, and many remain difficult to predict as election day begins.\n\nHere's what to watch for in Arizona's Tuesday primaries.\n\nScottsdale Democrats decide: Who will challenge David Schweikert?\n\nOver his seven House terms, U.S. Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., has weathered storms that his detractors thought would topple him, including an ethics scandal, unfriendly redistricting and bitter primary challenges.\n\nThis year, Democrats believe Schweikert may finally be on the ropes. GOP-led abortion restrictions in Arizona are expected to boost Democratic turnout across the board, and Trump's presence on the ballot could be a liability in Schweikert's Scottsdale-area district, where Trump-aligned candidates have underperformed.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats will determine who from their party should challenge him in Arizona's 1st Congressional District.\n\nThe candidates in the packed primary field include Andrei Cherny, a former Arizona Democratic Party chair; Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, a former journalist and the widow of former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods; Amish Shah, a doctor and a former state representative; Conor O'Callaghan, who works in finance; Andrew Horne, an orthodontist; and Kurt Kroemer, a former nonprofit executive.\n\nThe race has been energetic. Gal\u00e1n-Woods, vocal on the issues of democracy and abortion, has come under fire over her history as a former Republican; shadowed by a federal investigation, Cherny nabbed an endorsement from Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego; O'Callaghan has become a top fundraiser boosted by a personal loan close to $1 million; and Shah's diligent door-knocking and experience holding elected office are thought to give him an edge despite a contentious track record in the Legislature.\n\nThe district encompasses most of northeastern Maricopa County, including wealthy Scottsdale and Paradise Valley.\n\nPrimary election 2024: Here are the Arizona candidates running for US House of Representatives\n\nA D.C. rivalry plays out in northeastern Arizona\n\nA Beltway rivalry is playing out in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses the state's northeastern reaches.\n\nIncumbent U.S. Rep. Eli Crane is facing a primary challenge that has received some financial support from allies of the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who Crane helped boot from his leadership post.\n\nThe race was once widely viewed as a test of McCarthy's abilities to police an increasingly unruly caucus. Since the ascent of former President Donald Trump, many of Congress' traditional power brokers -- McCarthy among them -- have struggled to keep the peace within the GOP's ranks.\n\nIt's unclear how much McCarthy's allies have followed through on that pursuit. In their official fundraising, Crane's opponent, former Yavapai County Supervisor Jack Smith, has reported raising around $100,000 compared to Crane's $5 million. A group linked to McCarthy spent big on television ads against Crane in April, but their spending appears to have tapered since then.\n\nThe two candidates have sparred over their allegiance to McCarthy. Smith has argued Crane's speaker votes were misguided and a betrayal of the Republican Party. Crane, in turn, has cast Smith as an opportunist bankrolled by the D.C. \"Swamp.\"\n\nThe district includes Apache, Coconino, Graham, Greenlee and Navajo counties as well as parts of Gila, Maricopa, Mohave, Pima, Pinal and Yavapai counties.\n\nIn Phoenix: Who will succeed Rep. Ruben Gallego?\n\nTwo Democrats are facing off in Arizona's bright-blue 3rd Congressional District, a seat now held by U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is running for the Senate.\n\nBoth are self-described progressives, though their campaign trail allies and certain parts of their platforms would appear to put former Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n further to the left of her opponent, former Phoenix Vice Mayor Yassamin Ansari.\n\nTer\u00e1n has been endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party and received an endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nAnsari, on the other hand, has received an endorsement based on her support for Israel -- a top issue dividing progressive Democrats this election cycle -- while Ter\u00e1n has stayed quieter on the topic. Ansari has instead emphasized her productivity and effectiveness while serving on the Phoenix City Council.\n\nBoth candidates tout endorsements from labor unions, state their commitment to Medicare for All, and pledge strong action to combat climate change.\n\nPhysician Duane Wooten, a less well-known candidate, is also in the race.\n\nThe district where they are running, which covers much of western, southern and downtown Phoenix, leans heavily Democratic, meaning the winner is all but guaranteed to sail to victory in the November general election.\n\nWest Valley Republicans to crown Rep. Debbie Lesko's likely replacement\n\nA crowded field of Republicans in the West Valley-area 8th Congressional District is running to replace the outgoing U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.\n\nSparks have flown between former Arizona attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh, who has received Trump's coveted endorsement, and former U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters, whose multimillion-dollar personal loan has left him with by far the most campaign cash.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., is thought to command some name recognition from his time spent in Congress, though he is trailed by the scandal that pushed him from office, in which Franks asked a female staffer to carry his child.\n\nArizona House Speaker Ben Toma, R-Glendale, has kept a lower public profile in the race but boasts an endorsement from Lesko, the incumbent. His candidacy has been boosted by substantial spending from outside groups.\n\nState Sen. Anthony Kern's candidacy has gained attention as he is one of the Arizona electors who tried to falsely certify the 2020 presidential election in Arizona in favor of Trump, though his fundraising pales in comparison to many of his rivals'. Political neophyte Patrick Briody is also in the race.\n\nThe district covers parts of Maricopa and Yavapai counties, including Glendale, Peoria, Sun City West and New River.", "source": {"uri":

Multiple Republicans running for office this cycle helped fuel the unfounded election conspiracies.\n\nArizona voters are heading to the polls to formally set into motion the races for a coveted Senate seat and a closely watched House post that could tilt control in Congress, along with other primaries throughout the state.\n\nBut The Grand Canyon State has been rocked in recent election cycles by tense disputes over election outcomes and become a hotbed of election denialism. Multiple top candidates in today's GOP primaries helped fuel the election distrust.\n\nAt the top of the ticket, Republican Kari Lake, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in the Senate race to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in November, has the backing of former President Trump. She has been one of the most vocal deniers of the 2020 election results in Arizona, when President Biden beat Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes in the state.\n\nFollowing Trump's 2020 blueprint, Lake also has refused to acknowledge her loss in the 2022 campaign for governor and unsuccessfully challenged the outcome in court claiming she was the victim of a stolen election.\n\nOther prominent GOP election deniers with unsuccessful 2022 campaigns also appear on today's ballots.\n\nTwo candidates facing each other -- Abe Hamadeh, who unsuccessfully ran for attorney general, and Blake Masters, who lost a bid for the Senate -- have both secured Trump's \"Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Congressman of Arizona's 8th Congressional District,\" despite a bitter battle between the two.\n\nThe winner will go on to face Democrat Gregory Whitten in the November race to replace retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko (R) in Arizona's 8th District, which Republicans have held for the past decade.\n\nIn a campaign ad during his failed 2022 Senate race, Masters bluntly declared, \"I think Trump won in 2020.\" He ultimately acknowledged Biden as the \"legitimate president\" during debate and said he had seen no evidence of fraud.\n\nKatherine Keneally, director of threat analysis and prevention for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue's U.S. branch of election denialism, told The Hill it's not surprising to see election denialism continue to flourish in Arizona as prominent figures who have spread misinformation about outcomes continue to seek office.\n\n\"With those campaigns ongoing, these narratives just could never disappear,\" she said.\n\nElection deniers also are seeking office

Like Hiatt, Heap said the county has insecure practices for handling early ballots.\n\nUS House\n\n8th District: Front-runners Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters both received endorsements from former President Donald Trump as they try to clench the Republican nomination in the district northwest of Phoenix. It's considered the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubts on the validity of election results.\n\nWhoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. The other candidates are: former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. 1st District: Six Democrats are facing off for a chance to flip the nationally competitive seat that encompasses parts of Maricopa County. Biden won the district in 2020.\n\nEx-state Rep. Amish Shah, ex-local news anchor Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods, former state treasurer hopeful and state party chair Andrei Cherny, and investment banker Conor O'Callaghan were in a close four-way race. The other candidates are orthodontist Andrew Horne and former regional American Red Cross CEO Kurt Kroemer.\n\nOne of them will look to unseat incumbent Rep. David Schweikert who breezed through the GOP primary in November. Schweikert's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by ethics scandals. In 2022, Schweikert received a $125,000 fine by the Federal Elections Commission for misappropriating campaign funds. Two years prior, he agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and accept 11 campaign finance violations after an investigation by the U.S. House Ethics Committee.\n\nSchweikert defeated businessman Robert Backie, and ex-FBI agent and corporate investor Kim George.\n\n3rd District: Two Arizona Democrats are eyeing the seat left vacant by Ruben Gallego's decision to run for U.S. Senate. Ex-Phoenix City Councilmember Yassamin Ansari and ex-Arizona Democratic Party chair Raquel Ter\u00e1n were locked in a close race. The left-leaning district spans central and southwest Phoenix.\n\nAnsari has touted herself as progressive candidate who will \"stand up to MAGA extremism\" and defend abortion rights.\n\nTer\u00e1n, a former state Senate minority leader, emphasizes her success as an organizer and a key player in ousting Joe Arpaio from the Maricopa County sheriff's post. Jeff Zink, who claimed Biden's victory in 2020 was stolen, defeated Jesus David Mendoza to win the Republican nomination.\n\nArizona Legislature\n\nSenate District 2: Republican Shawnna Bolick was one of two senators to side with Democrats this year in repealing an 1864 near total-abortion ban. She was appointed to the seat last summer to fill a vacancy. Her popularity among voters in the competitive northwest Phoenix district will be tested for the first time as results keep rolling in. She faced small business owner Josh Barnett, who leans further to the right. Barnett has said Bolick's vote on the abortion bill was politically calculated as the district has become more purple.\n\nSenate District 7: Rep. David Cook challenged Wendy Rogers for the GOP nomination for the seat that represents Flagstaff, and parts of Navajo, Gila and Pinal counties. Rogers is a prolific election denier who is aligned with Trump and has been censured by the Legislature after backing white nationalism. Still, she's popular with her base and has a following nationally. Cook said constituents in the rural district care more about local issues like mining and water.\n\nSenate District 1: Incumbent Ken Bennett faced a challenge for the GOP bid from Mark Finchem, a Trump loyalist who most recently lost a bid to become Arizona's secretary of state. The reliably red district is anchored by Prescott. Bennett, a former secretary of state and state Senate president, is the more moderate of the two. Steve Zipperman, a real estate broker, also is seeking the GOP nomination and has said he's not a professional politician.\n\nJacques Billeaud, Gabriel Sandoval And Sejal Govindarao, The Associated

Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nLake defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended that he was more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But he ultimately struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters. Through the end of June, Lake had raised $10.3 million compared with Lamb's $2 million.\n\nAlso Read | Intel Layoffs: US-Based Tech Giant To Reduce Significant Workforce by Cutting Thousands of Jobs as Part of Efforts To Save Cost.\n\nGallego is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate.\n\nThe once-crowded field of Republicans looking at the Senate race thinned out when Lake, who built a national profile in former President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement in an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor, made clear she planned to run for the seat.\n\nAlso Read | Southport Stabbing: Third Child Dies, Five Others in Critical Condition After 'Ferocious' Stabbing Incident in UK; Police Quizzes 17-Year-Old Male Suspect.\n\nLake entered politics after leaving the news anchor desk at the Phoenix Fox affiliate and quickly became a rising star on the right.

Smith's only raised $84,000 compared to Crane's $5.4 million, and Crane has been top-of-mind with Republican voters lately due to his leadership in investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nIn the 8th District, Trump-endorsed Abe Hamadeh faces JD Vance-endorsed Blake Masters, along with a few other candidates, including former Rep. Trent Franks. Masters has a massive $6.6 million war chest, while Hamadeh, who's more well-known in Maricopa County, has $1.3 million.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_van_laar@redstate.com", "name": "Jennifer Van Laar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamb_(sheriff)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lamb (sheriff)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruben Gallego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Crane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona's_2nd_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona's 2nd congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Franks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Franks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Masters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maricopa_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/79/7fc9ddc6-4ce0-43b4-931e-307e78b58e35.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775014", "eventUri": "eng-9775014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

MAGA-adjacent in some of the most high-profile state Senate Republican primaries.\n\nOn the Democratic side, a key race pits a quiet incumbent against a former lawmaker who seems to court controversy.\n\nWhile 12 out of the 30 districts have competitive primaries, three key primary races have the potential to reshape the Senate. In two of those races, the winners in November will be pitched against Democrats who are gunning to flip a GOP-held seat. In another, the winning Republican will attempt to oust an incumbent Democrat.\n\nDemocrats would need to pick up two seats to get majority control after three decades of GOP control. A one-seat gain would knot the Senate up evenly at 15 Republicans and 15 Democrats.\n\nThese key primary contests are in Legislative districts 2, 9 and 17. In the other competitive primaries, the winner is likely to claim a Senate seat, given the partisan makeup of many of the districts.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nLegislative District 2: Incumbent Republican in swing district faces primary test\n\nIn north Phoenix, Sen. Shawnna Bolick and Josh Barnett are vying for the Republican nomination to represent LD2.\n\nBolick is standing on her record as a two-term House member, and her one year in the Senate, prioritizing school choice, low taxes, election integrity and the sanctity of life. She was one of two senators who voted to repeal the 1864 law that imposed a near-total abortion ban.\n\nBarnett has attacked Bolick for that vote, trying to draw the support of the far right in his party. But his candidacy has little financial firepower to get out his message: As of mid-July, he had $1,000 in his campaign coffers, compared with $164,000 for Bolick.\n\nThe winner will face Rep. Judy Schwiebert, a Democrat who hopes to move from the House to the Senate.\n\nArizona primary 2024: Here are the candidates running for the state Senate\n\nLegislative District 9: Republicans vie for nomination in swing district\n\nMesa's LD9 has retired Mesa police sergeant and small business owner Robert Scantlebury back for a second run at a Senate seat. The Republican lost to Democrat Eva Burch in 2022 by 5 points in a district that is considered up for grabs by either party.\n\nIn the primary, Scantlebury faces attorney Christopher Stapley, a Mesa native. Fundraising is lopsided, with Scantlebury far outpacing Stapley in donations.\n\nBurch is uncontested in her primary and will compete against the GOP primary winner.\n\nLegislative District 17: Rematch of 2022 GOP primary gets testy\n\nLD17 in southern Arizona is the grounds for a testy GOP rematch between Sen. Justine Wadsack and former state Sen. Vince Leach, whom Wadsack defeated two years ago.\n\nWadsack quickly made a name for herself at the state Capitol, joining the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus and being an outspoken supporter of the MAGA movement. Leach is seen as a more traditional, business-oriented Republican and has attacked Wadsack as being too far right for Arizona.\n\nThe candidate who comes up on top will face Democrat John McLean of Tucson. He is a retired businessman who worked on developing technology for national security efforts.\n\nLegislative District 22: Key Democratic primary\n\nThe results of the remaining eight competitive primaries will likely guarantee the winner a Senate seat, given the races are in districts that lean strongly left or right.\n\nIn LD22 in the southwest Valley, the Democratic race pits Sen. Eva Diaz against her former seatmate, state Rep. Leezah Sun.\n\nSun resigned from the House earlier this year in the face of a likely expulsion vote over disorderly conduct. She was accused of threatening lobbyists, including commenting that she wanted to throw a a Tolleson city staffer off a balcony. She is campaigning for affordable housing and support for public education, and puts working families at the center of her campaign.\n\nDiaz has maintained a quiet demeanor in her first Senate term. If re-elected, she said she would advocate for public schools and universities, affordable health care and working families, among other priorities.\n\nLegislative District 1: Trio of Prescott Republicans square off\n\nLegislative District 1's primary is a contest between three Prescott Republicans.\n\nSen. Ken Bennett is the target of Mark Finchem and Steve Zipperman, both of whom are running to the right of Bennett.\n\nBennett has been a pivotal vote for Republicans, occasionally withholding his support for legislation in order to get certain changes. That was most evident in his successful effort to amend the a measure that would give Arizona law enforcement authority to arrest and detain illegal border crossers. Bennett said he wanted to ensure the measure, if approved by voters in November, would not lead to massive roundups. He also got \"Dreamers,\" or people who came to the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival policy, exempted from the bill.\n\nBoth Finchem and Zipperman have used that vote to attack Bennett and to argue the Senate needs strong conservatives.\n\nFinchem is a former state lawmaker from Oro Valley. After he lost his bid for secretary of state, he moved to Prescott. He calls himself the \"original election skeptic\" because he raised concerns about how the 2020 election was conducted and tried to present evidence to Congress citing irregularities in an election that was upheld by numerous courts.\n\nZipperman calls himself \"the only true constitutional conservative\" in the race, citing his track record of teaching constitutional law. He lost to Bennett in the 2022 primary.\n\nLegislative District 7: Sitting GOP lawmakers face off\n\nIn LD7 in eastern Arizona, Rep. David Cook, R-Globe, is hoping to unseat Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff. Rogers, one of the most outspoken supporters of Donald Trump, is leaning on her MAGA credentials in her campaign for a third Senate term.\n\nCook has focused on issues that reflect the rural district's makeup, such as land conservation and water. He has benefited from independent expenditure committees that have supported him while pouring $380,000 into campaign messages critical of Rogers.\n\nFor her part, Rogers reports $1.3 million cash on hand, a reflection of her national profile in the MAGA movement.\n\nNew questions emerged earlier this month about Rogers' permanent residency, when reporters noted her campaign was sending travel reimbursement checks to a Tempe address. Rogers had been a longtime Tempe resident, but claims a mobile home community in Flagstaff as her official home.\n\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-228-7566 and follow

Vance is a a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of tech billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nIf the numbers hold, Hamadeh, who lives in Scottsdale, will have a job for life in this solidly Republican West Valley congressional district -- no small feat given Masters' money and his full-on assault targeting Hamadeh's family, his ethnic background and even his status as an unmarried, childless adult.\n\nAs for Lake, she needed to win 60% of the vote to show she can unify Republicans in a way that she was unable to do in 2022, when she lost the governor's race to Democrat Katie Hobbs.\n\n\"If (Pinal County Sheriff Mark) Lamb gets 35% to 40%, that's a huge problem for Lake,\" Republican consultant Barrett Marson told me, before the polls closed.\n\nWith a large swath of the votes counted, the underfunded, hardly noticed Lamb had 40% of the vote though he's likely to lose some ground as election day votes are counted. In early results, Lake stood at 53% -- a dismal number given that she was the presumptive Republican nominee even before she announced she was running for the Senate and endorsed by Trump soon after.\n\nLake needed to rack up 60% of the GOP vote to show the D.C. money crowd that she can be competitive against Democrat Ruben Gallego. That she can unite Republicans in a way that no MAGA candidate has been able to do since 2018, resulting in the loss of not one but two Senate seats to Democrats.\n\n\"If she's not in the high 50s or low 60s, it's Fat Tuesday for her,\" Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin said before the votes were released.\n\nElsewhere, it was a mixed bag in the battle between MAGA and traditional Republican candidates.\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor Tom Galvin is handily defeating his MAGA opponent, former Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita in the northeast Valley.\n\nBut in the East Valley, Supervisor Jack Sellers lost to his MAGA opponent, termed-out Chandler Councilman Mark Stewart. That may open the door for Democrat Joel Navarro in November, given the political makeup of this district.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell rolled over her Lake-endorsed opponent, Gina Godbehere.\n\nBut Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer looks to be in trouble, trailing his MAGA-supported opponent, Rep. Justin Heap.\n\nIn the Legislature, meanwhile, it's shaping up to be a disastrous night for traditional Republicans, as one of the state's loudest election deniers, former Rep. Mark Finchem, appears to have carpetbagged his way into a Senate seat in ruby red Yavapai County, defeating the more moderate Sen. Ken Bennett.\n\nHard-right Sen. Wendy Rogers is headed to a third term, defeating the term-limited Rep. David Cook.\n\nIn Pima County, the jury's still out on the battle royale between the hard-right Sen. Justine Wadsack and former Sen. Vince Leach. Leach has pulled into an oh-so-slim lead, but it's too close to know whether he will regain the Senate seat he lost to Wadsack in 2022.

MAGA-adjacent in some of the most high-profile state Senate Republican primaries.\n\nOn the Democratic side, a key race pits a quiet incumbent against a former lawmaker who seems to court controversy.\n\nWhile 12 out of the 30 districts have competitive primaries, three key primary races have the potential to reshape the Senate. In two of those races, the winners in November will be pitched against Democrats who are gunning to flip a GOP-held seat. In another, the winning Republican will attempt to oust an incumbent Democrat.\n\nDemocrats would need to pick up two seats to get majority control after three decades of GOP control. A one-seat gain would knot the Senate up evenly at 15 Republicans and 15 Democrats.\n\nThese key primary contests are in Legislative districts 2, 9 and 17. In the other competitive primaries, the winner is likely to claim a Senate seat, given the partisan makeup of many of the districts.\n\nFirst results expected at 8 p.m. Tuesday: Arizona primary election results\n\nIn north Phoenix, Sen. Shawnna Bolick and Josh Barnett are vying for the Republican nomination to represent LD2.\n\nBolick is standing on her record as a two-term House member, and her one year in the Senate, prioritizing school choice, low taxes, election integrity and the sanctity of life. She was one of two senators who voted to repeal the 1864 law that imposed a near-total abortion ban.\n\nBarnett has attacked Bolick for that vote, trying to draw the support of the far right in his party. But his candidacy has little financial firepower to get out his message: As of mid-July, he had $1,000 in his campaign coffers, compared with $164,000 for Bolick.\n\nThe winner will face Rep. Judy Schwiebert, a Democrat who hopes to move from the House to the Senate.\n\nArizona primary 2024: Here are the candidates running for the state Senate\n\nMesa's LD9 has retired Mesa police sergeant and small business owner Robert Scantlebury back for a second run at a Senate seat. The Republican lost to Democrat Eva Burch in 2022 by 5 points in a district that is considered up for grabs by either party.\n\nIn the primary, Scantlebury faces attorney Christopher Stapley, a Mesa native. Fundraising is lopsided, with Scantlebury far outpacing Stapley in donations.\n\nBurch is uncontested in her primary and will compete against the GOP primary winner.\n\nLD17 in southern Arizona is the grounds for a testy GOP rematch between Sen. Justine Wadsack and former state Sen. Vince Leach, whom Wadsack defeated two years ago.\n\nWadsack quickly made a name for herself at the state Capitol, joining the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus and being an outspoken supporter of the MAGA movement. Leach is seen a more traditional, business-oriented Republican and has attacked Wadsack as being too far right for Arizona.\n\nThe candidate who comes up on top will face Democrat John McLean of Tucson. He is a retired businessman who worked on developing technology for national security efforts.\n\nA recap of everything: When is Arizona's primary? Election day is July 30. Here is a voter guide to help you learn about all the candidates.\n\nThe results of the remaining eight competitive primaries will likely guarantee the winner a Senate seat, given the races are in districts that lean strongly left or right.\n\nIn LD22 in the southwest Valley, the Democratic race pits Sen. Eva Diaz against her former seatmate, state Rep. Leezah Sun.\n\nSun resigned from the House earlier this year in the face of a likely expulsion vote over disorderly conduct. She was accused of threatening lobbyists, including commenting that she wanted to throw a a Tolleson city staffer off a balcony. She is campaigning for affordable housing and support for public education, and puts working families at the center of her campaign.\n\nDiaz has maintained a quiet demeanor in her first Senate term. If re-elected, she said she would advocate for public schools and universities, affordable health care and working families, among other priorities.\n\nLegislative District 1's primary is a contest between three Prescott Republicans.\n\nSen. Ken Bennett is the target of Mark Finchem and Steve Zipperman, both of whom are running to the right of Bennett.\n\nBennett has been a pivotal vote for Republicans, occasionally withholding his support for legislation in order to get certain changes. That was most evident in his successful effort to amend the a measure that would give Arizona law enforcement authority to arrest and detain illegal border crossers. Bennett said he wanted to ensure the measure, if approved by voters in November, would not lead to massive roundups. He also got \"Dreamers,\" or people who came to the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival policy, exempted from the bill.\n\nBoth Finchem and Zipperman have used that vote to attack Bennett and to argue the Senate needs strong conservatives.\n\nFinchem is a former state lawmaker from Oro Valley. After he lost his bid for secretary of state, he moved to Prescott. He calls himself the \"original election skeptic\" because he raised concerns about how the 2020 election was conducted and tried to present evidence to Congress citing irregularities in an election that was upheld by numerous courts.\n\nZipperman calls himself \"the only true constitutional conservative\" in the race, citing his track record of teaching constitutional law. He lost to Bennett in the 2022 primary.\n\nIn LD7 in eastern Arizona, Rep. David Cook, R-Globe, is hoping to unseat Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Flagstaff. Rogers, one of the most outspoken supporters of Donald Trump, is leaning on her MAGA credentials in her campaign for a third Senate term.\n\nCook has focused on issues that reflect the rural district's makeup, such as land conservation and water. He has benefited from independent expenditure committees that have supported him while pouring $380,000 into campaign messages critical of Rogers.\n\nFor her part, Rogers reports $1.3 million cash on hand, a reflection of her national profile in the MAGA movement.\n\nNew questions emerged earlier this month about Rogers' permanent residency, when reporters noted her campaign was sending travel reimbursement checks to a Tempe address. Rogers had been a longtime Tempe resident, but claims a mobile home community in Flagstaff as her official home.\n\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-228-7566 and follow her on Threads as well as on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter @maryjpitzl.\n\nSupport local journalism.

The presidential primary has come and gone, but the rest of the primary fights take place today. Republicans will contest against each other up and down the ballot, and so will Donald Trump and JD Vance ... by proxy.\n\nAs always, we'll have live results as they come in. And once again, we are partnering with our friends at Decision Desk HQ to provide real-time vote results after polls close, which will happen at various times tonight. The widgets below will list those times, and will automatically update. Please note: The House primaries are all available in a single widget; you will need to use the drop-down box to choose the race you want.\n\nWe're able to do this, of course, in large part because of the support of our VIP and VIP Gold members. Become a HotAir VIP member today and use promo code 2024 to receive a 50% discount on your membership.\n\nPolls close at 10 ET, and then the absentee and early vote totals should emerge quickly. Election day votes will mostly come in soon afterward, but as much as 10% of the vote count may take until Thursday.\n\nThe big test tonight will be of Kari Lake's strength. Mike Lamb raised a respectable amount of cash ($1.7M) to challenge her for the GOP's Senate nomination, but Lake got $7.2 million and Trump's endorsement to boot. Lamb was sheriff of Pinal County for several years and could surprise people. There hasn't been much polling at all; the two Noble Predictive Insights polls put Lake up by double digits, but she was +25 in May and only +11 last week. She hasn't gotten to 50% in either one, so it's worth watching to see if Lamb has gotten some momentum in the closing days of the primary.\n\nIn the House races, the most interesting may be the Dem primary for AZ-01. That's nominally an R+2 district, but it's also entirely in Maricopa County and will be very competitive. It's a six-way race to see who will challenge incumbent Republican Dave Schweikart. Former Clinton speechwriter Andrei Cherny seems to be the favorite, but the money got spread around in the primary.\n\nRepublicans have competitive primaries in AZ-02, AZ-04, and AZ-08. The incumbent House Republican should win the AZ-02 primary, while AZ-04's primary looks like a real contest between Kelly Cooper and Zuhdi Jasser. Jasser got the slight edge on fundraising, but Cooper has the Trump endorsement. The winner faces incumbent Dem Rep. Greg Stanton in a D+2 district that could flip if a red wave emerges in November.\n\nFor a fun \"GOP infighting\" race, look no further than AZ-08, an R+10 district but steeped with intrigue for the moment. Incumbent Republican Debbie Lesko has announced her retirement, and Trent Franks has un-retired to seek his old seat again. He has to contend with Trump-endorsed Abraham Hamadeh and JD Vance-endorsed Blake Masters, who ran statewide two years ago. Masters has far more funds raised for this than anyone in the field, more than five times that of Hamadeh and more than ten times the amount Franks raised. Lots of eyeballs will be on this result, but the winner should be able to carry the district easily in November.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors":

Here's what you need to know leading up to them.\n\nTwenty of Arizona's 30 legislative districts have competitive primaries for House seats, giving voters a choice in these intraparty contests.\n\nOnce the votes are counted, the winners in all but a handful of the races can start measuring the drapes for their offices at the Capitol. That's because most of the districts lean reliably Democratic or Republican, meaning the winner of the primary is all but guaranteed a win in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nBut races in a handful of swing districts could have a profound effect on the makeup of the Legislature next year. The primary election outcomes in several swing districts will determine if Republicans continue their six-decade dominance in the state House, or whether Democrats will achieve their long-sought goal of flipping the 60-member House to give them majority control. Currently, Republicans hold a two-seat edge over Democrats, 31-29. If even one seat switches to the Democratic column, the House would be evenly split.\n\nWatch for the results in Legislative districts 2, 16 and 23 to see how that sets the playing field for the November election. LD2 in the north Phoenix area and LD16 in Pinal County each have four Republicans vying for two seats. In the southwest corner of the state, LD23 has attracted three Democrats for two seats.\n\nTwelve of the competitive primaries are among Republican candidates, eight are Democratic faceoffs.\n\nArizona primary 2024: Here are the candidates running for the House of Representatives\n\nOpen seats draw fresh faces\n\nWhile most of the races feature incumbent lawmakers hoping to return to the Capitol, two districts are wide open.\n\nIn the East Valley's Legislative District 10, three Republicans are vying for the two House seats that represent much of Mesa and a sliver of western Apache Junction. LD10 is heavily Republican so the winners of this primary are likely to win in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nJustin Olson is making a comeback bid. He served three terms in the House before being appointed to the Arizona Corporation Commission in 2017. He made an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate in 2022.\n\nNewcomer Matt Greer and former candidate Ralph Heap are also in the race.\n\nHeap is the father of Rep. Justin Heap, who is running for Maricopa County recorder instead of seeking a return to the Legislature. Ralph Heap is a physician, and no stranger to legislative campaigns. In 2014, he ran for a state Senate seat but lost to incumbent Bob Worsley.\n\nGreer hails from a family with deep Arizona ties -- think the eastern Arizona town of Greer. An Army paratrooper who served in Afghanistan, Greer works in real estate.\n\nIn the northwest Valley's Legislative District 27, four Republicans are seeking to fill the two vacant House seats.\n\nTony Rivero is hoping to return to the Legislature after a four-year absence. He served three terms in the House, and chaired the state and international affairs committee.\n\nRivero is running on a team with Glendale resident Lisa Fink, who said she was recruited to join the team, along with Kevin Payne, who is leaving his House seat to seek a state Senate seat.\n\nAlso running are Linda Busam, a former member of the Western Maricopa Education Board and Brian Morris, a Glendale resident who owns a pool-renovation business.\n\nKey Republican races\n\nThe acrimony in the GOP primary in eastern Arizona's LD7 has elevated the race beyond the rural district's boundaries. Candidate Steve Slaton has stood by his claims that he was an Army helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War, despite records that show he had joined the Army after U.S. troops had left the country.\n\nSlaton is in the most competitive legislative primary, with six Republicans chasing two seats. Wendy Rogers, who is running for reelection to the district's Senate seat, has endorsed him and brushed off complaints that as a military veteran herself, she is backing a fraud.\n\nOthers in the race are Rep. David Marshall, a Snowflake pastor seeing a second term; former state Rep. Walt Blackman; former state Rep. John Fillmore; Barby Ingle, an advocate for people with chronic illnesses; and Andrew Costanzo, who calls himself an America First candidate.\n\nSparks have flown for weeks in a five-way GOP primary in the southeast Valley. Earlier this month, Rep. Laurin Hendrix of Gilbert referred to negative campaign information he was given that tried to link opponent Lalani Hunsaker's son to the \"Gilbert Goons,\" a teen gang that has terrorized the community for more than a year.\n\nAt a meeting of Legislative District 14 Republicans, Hendrix cited his decision to not use the information as he complained about the negative tone of campaigning. But he had aired the information, angering Hunsaker's husband and leading to a confrontation that is now being investigated by Gilbert police.\n\nLalani Hunsaker bitterly criticized Hendrix and district Chairman Andrew Adams and charged them with spreading lies about her children. Hunsaker, a first-time candidate, is government relations director for Charter One, the parent company of the American Leadership Academy chain of schools. The Gilbert branch of the school fired a football coach after media reports found he allowed a student tied to the Gilbert Goons to continue playing.\n\nOther candidates in the race include Khyl Powell, who runs a real estate development company dealing with industrial properties. He previously worked for the Phoenix Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. He is running on a slate with Hendrix and Senate President Warren Petersen.\n\nAlso in the race are Joel Coen, president of TruNorth Advisors, a business consultation company; and Andrew Jackson, who worked as a senior pastoral leader for two churches, and has taught at Chandler, Gilbert and Mesa community colleges.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nOn the Democratic side, eight districts have competitive races. Many of them feature lawmakers who were appointed to the Legislature earlier this year, as a wave of resignation swept through the Democratic fold.\n\nThey include LD5 in central Phoenix, where Sarah Ligouri and Charles Lucking, both appointed, are seeking election in their own right. They join Aaron Marquez, an Army veteran and current member of the Phoenix Union High School District board, and Dorrie Thyden, who has worked in government jobs at various levels, including the U.S. State Department.\n\nIn Tucson's LD21, incumbent Reps. Consuelo Hernandez and Stephanie Stahl-Hamilton are hoping voters return them to the Capitol but face challenger Brianna Ortega, an attorney whose practice focuses on small business operators.\n\nIn the southwest Valley, House minority leader Lupe Contreras of Avondale leads a field of four candidates. Rep. Elda Luna-N\u00e1jera, president of the Tolleson High School District board who was appointed earlier this year to fill a vacancy, is running for a term of her own.\n\nAlso in the race are Betsy Mu\u00f1oz, who has worked with education nonprofits to promote readiness for college; and Jen Wynne.\n\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-228-7566 and follow her on

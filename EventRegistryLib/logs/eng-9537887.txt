The 18-year-old center is a finalist for the Calder Trophy, voted as NHL rookie of the year.\n\nFantilli, a 19-year-old center, had 27 points (12 goals, 15 assists) in 49 games for the Blue Jackets. Celebrini won the Hobey Baker Award on April 12, named the top men's player in NCAA ice hockey.

He was named rookie of the year and player of the year in Hockey East.\n\nThe NHL Draft Lottery, which will determine which team will likely take Celebrini with the No. 1 pick, will be May 7.\n\nIn his blog for NHL.com, Celebrini said he hasn't decided if he will go the NHL next season or stay in school.\n\n\"I know the NHL Draft Lottery is going to happen soon and, like anyone else, I'm curious,\" Celebrini wrote. \"As is the case in any other year, you want to see it. I've grown up watching the draft and watching these prospects so in that sense I don't think it's any different, but I am curious to see how it all unfolds.\n\n\"With regard to next season, we didn't win anything at BU as a team this year so there's definitely some unfinished business that would drive that decision in that way.

At just 17 years old, he became the youngest player to ever win the award -- and just the fourth freshman in 44 years.\n\nBut that's not all -- Celebrini racked up plenty of awards in his single season at BU:\n\nCelebrini, a Vancouver native, made his debut for Team Canada with the under-17 team at the 2022 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. The next year, he made the under-18 team and played in the 2023 IIHF U18 World Championship.\n\nCelebrini then joined the national junior team at the 2024 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, played last December and January during the college season.\n\nNow, after helping lead BU to a Frozen Four appearance, Celebrini has accepted an invite to make his senior national team debut at the 2024 IIHF World Championship -- which will be held from May 10 to May 26 in the Czech Republic.\n\nCelebrini had a standout 2022-23 season in the United States Hockey League (USHL) before attending Boston University. While suiting up for the Chicago Steel, he led the league with 86 points -- the most ever by a player under 17 years old. He was named Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year and Forward of the Year, the first player to earn all three awards in a single season.\n\nThe Chicago Steel have a long history of developing NHL players. Adam Fantilli (No. 3 pick in 2023) and Owen Power (No. 1 pick in 2021) are two of the recent success stories, with Celebrini next to follow in their footsteps. He could return to the city next season, too -- the Chicago Blackhawks hold the second-best odds to win the draft lottery (13.5%).\n\nSports have been a staple of the Celebrini family for as long as Macklin can remember. His father, Rick, played soccer for the Vancouver 86ers, and now works for the Golden State Warriors as their vice president of player health and performance.\n\nMacklin's older brother, Aiden, was drafted by the Canucks in the sixth round last year. Instead of joining their home club, the elder Celebrini opted to play with his younger brother at BU.\n\nWith his father working for the Warriors, Celebrini has deep ties to the Bay Area. He played for the San Jose Jr. Sharks' U-14 squad in the 2019-20 season, where he had 49 goals and 94 points in 54 games while competing with players one year older.\n\nCelebrini's NHL future could lead him back to San Jose, with the Sharks holding the best odds to win the draft lottery (25.5 percent).

Where would he fit on each?", "body": "As the second round of the playoffs opens, there are still eight teams alive with Stanley Cup aspirations.\n\nThat leaves 24 teams sitting in their respective cities with nothing to play for until the regular season opens again in the fall. But 16 of those teams will have their competitive juices flowing one more time on Tuesday evening when the NHL draft lottery takes place, where the non-playoff teams are entered into a drawing to determine the order of selection for this June's NHL draft in Vegas.\n\nThe lottery rules were amended in 2022 to allow teams to only jump up a maximum of 10 spots in the order. That means 11 teams have a chance to land the first overall pick on Tuesday, which would grant them the right to select consensus No. 1 prospect Macklin Celebrini.\n\nCelebrini's arrival in those 11 cities could alter their trajectory in the years to come.\n\nSo where would Celebrini fit on the opening night roster? Would his arrival help push the team into the window of playoff contention? And which of these 11 teams believe they deserve some lottery luck on Tuesday night?\n\nAs a primer ahead of the lottery, The Athletic asked a handful of writers to tackle these questions and look at the odds for each to end up with the No. 1 overall selection.\n\nWhat are the odds? 25.5 percent\n\nWhen was the last time the team picked first in the draft? The Sharks have never drafted first overall. The last time they picked as high as second overall was in 1997 when they drafted Patrick Marleau.\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? Let's see, the Sharks scored only 180 goals. Only Chicago scored fewer. Their leading point producer, Mikael Granlund, had 60. They had eight double-digit goal scorers but only one, Fabian Zetterlund, went north of 20. Two of them, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl and Anthony Duclair, were dealt at the deadline. This roster could well be paper-thin once again. With the way he dominated college hockey, Celebrini wouldn't look out of place on San Jose's top line.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? It might depend on whether Logan Couture is healthy enough to return next season but why not have Celebrini start building chemistry with Zetterlund and William Eklund? It doesn't seem like Will Smith is ready to leave Boston College so dropping him in between the team's best wingers makes the most sense at the start. Zetterlund has a terrific shot and Eklund came on in the second half as a dual scoring/playmaking threat.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? It is going to be a while with or without Celebrini, but let's nudge this toward the optimistic. How about 2027-28? That'll give Mike Grier and Co. four seasons to get it together.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? It is too good of a storyline. His father, Rick, is the director of sports medicine and performance for the NBA's Golden State Warriors. Macklin might be Canadian and a product of North Vancouver, but he was cooking for the Jr. Sharks 14U AAA team before heading to Shattuck-St. Mary's. Rick is openly rooting for San Jose to win the lottery. Let's not forget that the Sharks have never drafted No. 1 overall. They would be set for the future with Celebrini and Smith as their top two centers. One player is not going to change things overnight and San Jose has a long way to go. But a proud franchise and fan base that suffered through a horrid season deserves to rally around a new star with Bay Area ties. -- Eric Stephens\n\nWould Celebrini make your opening night roster and where would he play? Celebrini would almost definitely play for the Blackhawks next season. He'd probably center the second or third line.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? The Blackhawks were probably going to get a new linemate or two for Bedard this offseason. If they drafted Celebrini, the Blackhawks would likely be motivated to bring in a few more capable top-six veterans. Taylor Hall would definitely be one option among the current players.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Blackhawks are still a number of years away from contending. With as many young players as they're bringing in at the same time, they're probably still 2-4 years away from being a contender.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? It's hard to argue that the Blackhawks deserve Celebrini after getting lucky with Bedard last year and considering the run they had with Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. I'm staying away from this question. -- Scott Powers\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? That is a good question. General manager Pat Verbeek has sent out mixed vibes when it comes to the development of his best young talent. Verbeek has talked about keeping players in the minors for longer periods, but he had top-10 picks Leo Carlsson and Pavel Mintyukov in Anaheim as rookies. Mason McTavish also skipped past the American Hockey League. The Ducks have Carlsson and McTavish as their top two centers and they still have Trevor Zegras, who prefers the middle over the wing. Unless you play him in the AHL for a bit, the best spot would be to ease Celebrini in on the third line. Give him some solid minutes but don't overwhelm him right off the bat.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? That would be an interesting task for second-year coach Greg Cronin. Carlsson played a lot with Alex Killorn and Troy Terry. McTavish often had veterans Frank Vatrano and Ryan Strome on his wings. Zegras played with a mixture when he was healthy in an injury-plagued season. Add in Cutter Gauthier joining full-time next season and Verbeek's desire to get a top-six wing, most likely on the right side. The more I think about it, I'm liking Celebrini to start with Vatrano and Strome on the third line or perhaps Killorn on a wing if Gauthier, Vatrano and Zegras fill top-six spots.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Ducks will be expected to win more games next season after injuries, inconsistency and undisciplined play derailed any attempt to move forward. They might need to sort out their forward groupings, but this new core with a talented, fully rebuilt defense should be entering its prime in a couple years. Play meaningful games next spring and then make a major push in 2025-26.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Ducks are another team that hasn't had the No. 1 pick. They missed out on Sidney Crosby in 2005 when they took Bobby Ryan at No. 2. They should have had Connor Bedard last year given that they had the best odds to land him, though it appears they'll do quite well with Carlsson as a nice consolation prize. Landing Celebrini would round out a new core that Verbeek is assembling as he eyes eventual contention when his rebuild is finished. The pieces are in place for a potentially strong blue line -- emphasis still on potential -- and they would have high-quality youngsters to drive three forward lines. If they all hit, and it feels like Celebrini will, Anaheim could soon have an enviable group that's on the rise. -- Eric Stephens\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? The Blue Jackets didn't have a problem throwing Adam Fantilli into the deep end last season, giving him roughly 15 minutes per night at the center ice position. But they've also played the long and patient game with other high-end prospects like Kent Johnson and David Jiricek. Columbus will have a new general manager calling the shots and he might determine whether it makes sense for Celebrini to crack the opening night roster.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? Fantilli had the luxury of playing with Johnny Gaudreau as his main winger last season and it helped the rookie center collect 12 goals and 27 points in 49 games before his injury. Among the top-six candidates heading into next season, Gaudreau, Kirill Marchenko and Laine are locks -- assuming Laine returns to health. Yegor Chinakhov and Johnson are emerging talents with upside, while Alex Nylander could play a significant role after an impressive finish to the season that saw him score 11 times in 28 games. There would be options for Celebrini to play along at least one winger with 25-35-goal potential.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Jackets have not made the playoffs since 2020 and even Celebrini's arrival may not accelerate their growth to the point where the playoffs are realistic any time soon. Columbus has a .381 points percentage in the last two seasons combined, by far the worst in the Eastern Conference. In an ideal world, a core of Fantilli, Johnson, Jiricek, Cole Sillinger and Celebrini would be given a couple of years to mature together, with playoffs a possibility in 2026 or 2027.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? All you need to do is go back and re-read Aaron Portzline's story from late March about the chaotic and dysfunctional history of the Blue Jackets. This fan base has endured nothing but disappointment and agony since joining the NHL in 2000. And after Columbus PR staffer Lindy Noel donated a kidney to Portzline so he could undergo a transplant procedure last month, everybody in the hockey world should be pulling for a little good karma to go back to the Blue Jackets. -- Ian Mendes\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? Based on how the Canadiens incorporated Kirby Dach last season and Alex Newhook this season, they would in all likelihood start Celebrini on the wing to ease him into the NHL and slowly transition him back to the center position.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? Depending on whether the Canadiens bring in a winger to play in an offensive role this offseason, they could start Celebrini on the wing of a third line built around either Newhook or Christian Dvorak at center and perhaps Joel Armia on the opposite wing. Or they could put Celebrini with Dach on the second line with Newhook or perhaps Josh Anderson on the opposite wing.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? I'm not sure Celebrini would necessarily accelerate the Canadiens' timeline for Stanley Cup contention, but it would definitely solidify that timeline and remove some of the question marks around its viability. Right now, the Canadiens are probably looking at a contention window that opens in three years, which would make Celebrini 21. Sounds about right for a very young player to become acclimatized to the rigors of the NHL and ready to contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Canadiens had the No. 1 pick in 2022 at a draft they were hosting, so it's not as if they haven't had any lottery luck recently. But, the Canadiens did not openly tank this season, as opposed to the top contenders to land this pick, and the hockey gods should be rewarding that kind of behavior. -- Arpon Basu\n\nWhat are the odds? 7.5 percent\n\nWhen was the last time the team picked first in the draft? This will be Utah's first season in the NHL, so this is technically their first draft. And while they inherited the hockey operations department and roster from the Coyotes, the history of that franchise stayed behind in Arizona. For the record, that Coyotes franchise did have the No. 1 overall selection once -- when the original Winnipeg Jets drafted Dale Hawerchuk in 1981.\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? Celebrini might be able to slot in behind Logan Cooley, giving Utah a young and dynamic one-two punch down the middle. The team also has veteran centers in Nick Bjugstad and Alex Kerfoot who could provide a bit of insulation for Celebrini as needed, giving him a chance to start further down in the lineup.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? If Utah wants to put Celebrini in a position to succeed right away, they have a handful of productive wingers who could play alongside him. Clayton Keller has become a bona fide 30-goal scorer, while Lawson Crouse and Nick Schmaltz have each scored 20 goals in three straight seasons. Plus, Matias Maccelli has been a productive playmaking left winger in each of his two full seasons in the NHL. Dylan Guenther has the potential to be a high-end sniper, but since he's only 21 years old, it might be a bit too much to put him on the same line as Celebrini.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Coyotes were in the thick of the playoff race in the Western Conference until just before the All-Star break in February. That's when the relocation rumors started to pop up and the team went into a tailspin, dropping 14 straight games. If they add Celebrini to the mix, there is a chance this team could flirt with a playoff spot as early as next season.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? Has there been a group of players who endured more negativity and uncertainty than Utah's players over the past year? From constantly dealing with relocation rumors to playing for an outright dysfunctional franchise, these players deserve a fresh start in a new market. Landing the first overall pick and nabbing Celebrini would certainly add to the feel of a fresh start for a group of players who deserved a lot more support from ownership. Plus, adding Celebrini to a collection of talented, young prospects could help create a lot of excitement and buzz for the NHL in Utah in their inaugural season. -- Ian Mendes\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? This would be a fascinating situation, considering center ice might be Ottawa's only position of strength. They already have Tim St\u00fctzle, Josh Norris and Shane Pinto, plus Ridly Greig who can play down the middle too. A lot of this could depend on Norris and if the Senators feel like moving him to the wing is an option. They've already done that at times with Greig. But at best, it would look like Celebrini would slot in as a No. 3 or No. 4 center on this team right now.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? If Celebrini is going to start down lower on Ottawa's depth chart, it probably means he won't have a chance to play with the most talented wingers like Brady Tkachuk, Claude Giroux and Drake Batherson. A player like Mathieu Joseph might make sense as a winger for Celebrini -- a speedy winger with potential to open up the ice.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? I would imagine the Senators have playoff aspirations for as early as next season, so it's probably fair to say it would start in the 2024-25 season.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Senators traded away their first-round draft picks in each of the last two years, plus the NHL has stripped away another first-round pick for the Evgenii Dadonov trade fiasco. They have to forfeit that pick by 2026, which means the Senators are staring directly into a stretch where they won't have a first-round pick three times in five years. And none of that blame should fall on the new ownership group and managerial team. They inherited a mess. Add in a seven-year playoff drought, a 41-game gambling suspension for Pinto that came with a vague explanation and a prolonged sale process that was dragged out for months and you've got a pretty good recipe for why the Senators deserve some lottery luck. -- Ian Mendes\n\nWhat are the odds? 6.0 percent\n\nWhen was the last time the team picked first in the draft? The Kraken have only participated in three NHL drafts since joining the league for the 2021-22 season. Their highest pick in that window came in 2021 when they drafted Matthew Beniers second overall.\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? Seattle is without a head coach, so it's again hard to say without knowing their tendencies and how they handle young talent. The Kraken have been willing to take a more patient approach with young talent if they don't look ready to be exposed to NHL competition on a regular basis -- take Shane Wright, who has been crushing it in Coachella Valley. There is a really strong AHL team to join if there are any concerns. On the other hand, there's the Beniers path of jumping right into NHL action. So there isn't one blueprint for how the Kraken handle their top talent. I think the most likely answer, even without knowing who their next head coach would be, is yes -- and management would carefully analyze his next nine games to make sure that was the right call.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? With the Kraken making a coaching change, familiar combinations in Seattle could look different next season so it's tricky to say. Celebrini would likely slot behind Beniers on the depth chart and be somewhat sheltered in his usage, with someone like Yanni Gourde shouldering the workload behind him. Jaden Schwartz and Andre Burakovsky could make sense as his wingers.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Kraken could be a playoff team next season, but a true contender? Maybe if the young core has another year or two to cook, Seattle will have that star power they've been missing to reach that.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Kraken's offense wilted and knocked them out of playoff contention this year. They may not be the worst team in the NHL, but this is an up-and-coming franchise that could use some lottery luck to compete with the Western Conference contenders around them. It could be a reward for their measured, balanced approach versus Vegas' loud and splashy start. -- Shayna Goldman\n\nWhat are the odds? 5.0 percent\n\nWhen was the last time the team picked first in the draft? Despite joining the NHL in 1972, the Flames have never had the first overall pick in the draft. Since they relocated to Calgary in 1980, they haven't even picked inside the top three overall spots. Sam Bennett, who was taken fourth overall in 2014, is their highest draft pick in Calgary.\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? Top-six center\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? Jonathan Huberdeau has to be in that conversation. Not only could Celebrini serve as the high-end talent that could help revive their $10.5-million winger, but he is also the exact type of talent the Flames need for their retooling. Other possibilities include Andrei Kuzmenko and Yegor Sharangovich. Also, imagine a kid line of Connor Zary, Celebrini and Martin Pospisil? That would be fun, especially on Day 1 of a new season.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? 2025-26\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Flames desperately need gamebreakers to be taken seriously as a legitimate Cup contender, something they've lacked since Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Tkachuk departed the franchise in the same offseason. The team has worked to accumulate assets in the wake of pending UFAs like Noah Hanifin, Chris Tanev, Tyler Toffoli, Nikita Zadorov and Elias Lindholm being traded away. But they still need more higher-grade assets to help their team's timeline. -- Julian McKenzie\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? The answer is most likely yes for the Devils, but it's tricky to know for sure when the coaching search is still ongoing. The best bet, without knowing the new coach's tendencies, would be yes, somewhere in the middle-six. There would be two options for New Jersey to explore: Letting him drive his own line as the team's third-line center or letting him acclimate alongside one of their elite top-six centers. Celebrini won't knock Nico Hischier or Jack Hughes out of position, but similar to Dawson Mercer, it could make sense for the Devils to shift him to wing to let him skate alongside their best players.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? If Celebrini shifts to wing to play in the top six, he could make sense alongside a two-way playmaker like Hischier. But if the new coach wants Hischier to match up against top competition, then welcome to Jack Hughes' wing. It's a win-win either way, with options from Timo Meier, Jesper Bratt, or Mercer to play wing opposite him. If Celebrini sticks at center to start, then Ondrej Palat and Erik Haula likely round out that third line.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The Devils should have been a contender this year after their impressive 2022-23, so with Celebrini in the fold, they should absolutely get back to that next season.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? A very unlucky season, dragged down by goaltending and coaching, let the Devils slip out of the playoff picture and into the race for this pick. If New Jersey wins another draft lottery, it's more lucky than deserving. -- Shayna Goldman\n\nWhere would Celebrini play in Game 1? He'd have a strong chance to be on the Sabres' opening night roster. Buffalo is in need of a third center after trading Casey Mittelstadt, so Celebrini could slot in there. He could also play in the top six if either Tage Thompson or Dylan Cozens moved to wing.\n\nWho are his most likely linemates? Adding a player like Celebrini would make Buffalo rethink what the top three lines look like. The Sabres also have a lot up in the air with a new coach and four open roster spots in their forward group. Celebrini could play with 2023 first-rounder Zach Benson and an experienced winger like Alex Tuch. He could play with Jeff Skinner, assuming the Sabres don't buy him out. But there's also a chance Celebrini's hypothetical linemates aren't on the team yet.\n\nWhat year would the team return to contention with Celebrini? The hope would be next season. Lindy Ruff said this is a \"win-now situation.\" Would adding another 18-year-old put them over the edge in 2024-25? Maybe not. But Celebrini is the type of player that would make the Sabres better right away and could become their top center before too long.\n\nWhy does the team deserve Celebrini? The Sabres have obviously already had their crack at top draft picks over the last decade. They took Sam Reinhart and Jack Eichel No. 2 overall. Eichel won a Stanley Cup with the Golden Knights and Reinhart scored 57 goals for the Panthers. The Sabres have since had two No. 1 overall picks, Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power. Still, they have a 13-season playoff drought, the longest in the history of the league. That seems like reason enough for why they deserve some good fortune. Buffalo's fan base is starving for a winner.

But when you're next in line after Connor Bedard, and the public is perhaps still recovering from the media circus he drew in his draft year, it's actually possible.\n\nNo, Celebrini is not a once-in-a-decade prospect like Bedard. He is, however, a special player with franchise center potential -- one who deserves more buzz and attention than he's currently getting. Celebrini, the youngest player in college hockey, scored 32 goals and 64 points in 38 games as a freshman at Boston University and won the Hobey Baker Award.\n\nThe dynamic two-way center's 1.68 points-per-game rate as a first-time draft-eligible player in the NCAA only narrowly trails Jack Eichel (1.77) and Adam Fantilli (1.80). The key difference, however, is that Eichel and Fantilli were both two of the oldest players of their respective draft classes. They were ripping it up as 18-year-olds whereas Celebrini, one of the youngest players of his draft class, won't turn 18 until June.\n\nIt's rare for 17-year-olds to produce in the NCAA -- no player since 2000 has scored more at the same age than Celebrini. Jonathan Toews, for context, is second in U18 NCAA scoring with 22 goals and 39 points in 42 games for the University of North Dakota during his draft year.\n\nHere's a closer look at Celebrini's game and what makes him such a talent.\n\nThe biggest surprise when you first watch Celebrini play is that he's a remarkably complete 200-foot center. Yes, he has flashy elite offensive tools (more on that later), but that's the norm for a projected No. 1 pick. It's far less typical to find a center with a polished all-around game on top of the dynamic, electrifying skill.\n\nCelebrini's two-way prowess is particularly impressive because he's battling young men, most of whom are a few years older, rather than peers his age. Several draft analysts have compared Celebrini's two-way skill set to Jonathan Toews' and there's definitely some resemblance as you dive into the film.\n\nCelebrini never cheats for offense. He back-checks with the same vigor that he shows when he's leading an odd-man rush offensively. He comes deep in the defensive zone to support his defensemen on battles and breakouts. He has a non-stop motor, works quickly to close gaps defensively and is strong physically despite his average size. He won 53.5 percent of his faceoffs as a freshman.\n\nLet's show some examples, starting with the clip below. Celebrini forces the puck carrier to the outside on an entry, assertively applies pressure, strips possession away and makes a neat pass up to a winger to spark a clean breakout.\n\nIn the next clip, Celebrini is below the goal line in the defensive zone, ready for a 50/50 battle with a forward on a puck rimmed around the boards. Celebrini leans in and knocks the forward to the ice (a sign of how sturdy he is on his feet). He's unable to fish the puck out but as the play develops, he anticipates well and ties up the puck carrier, Oliver Moore, along the wall which allows Boston University to recover possession.\n\nCelebrini is ferocious in pursuing the puck in all three zones. Here's a short montage of other standout plays without the puck.\n\nCelebrini's two-way commitment is striking and rare for a player this young. Bedard, for reference, was unparalleled offensively but even he struggled defensively at times in the WHL and had an inconsistent work ethic away from the puck. Celebrini isn't perfect defensively -- sometimes he'll dive in to try and strip an opponent of the puck and get beat -- but he has a high two-way ceiling.\n\nCelebrini doesn't lead offensive rushes with the straight-line explosiveness of a player like Nathan MacKinnon, but he still looks unguardable at times on the fast break. He's a smooth, powerful skater, owns a wide arsenal of dekes and tricks and is nimble on his edges which allows him to change his angles of attack. He's not quite at the level of Jack Hughes' magician-like creativity on rushes, but there are some similarities with their puck skills and dynamic movement.\n\nHere's a crafty offensive zone entry where he weaves in and out of traffic, manipulating his skating route to create space where it looks like he has none.\n\nThis combination of high-end skating, hands and intelligence makes him a strong puck transporter and play-driver. From a defender's perspective, it's difficult to predict what he's going to do with the puck because he keeps his head up, doesn't spill body language cues that telegraph his next play and is capable of routinely making no-look passes. Celebrini opens space up for his linemates and has the vision to tee them up for chances.\n\nWatch how Celebrini takes an ordinary two-on-two rush and transforms it into a dangerous chance in the play below. The defender lunges in because he thinks the puck is exposed, but Celebrini neatly pulls it back to sidestep the check. He then sends a saucer pass over the other defender's stick to set up a high-danger one-timer chance.\n\nThe rush assist below is ridiculous. Celebrini pulls a deke through his legs to create space, then sends a no-look spin pass right onto the tape of a backdoor teammate.\n\nCelebrini's one-on-one skill is incredible and it's encouraging to see him drive the puck to high-traffic areas on the inside, rather than feasting on perimeter plays that won't translate as well to the NHL. Here's a wickedly smooth rush where he undresses the defender, takes the puck to the net and rings a shot off the crossbar.\n\nCelebrini is guilty of occasionally forcing passes into the slot when the lane isn't available. But that's part of a young player exploring his skill set and learning what works and what doesn't. You'd rather have a special offensive talent who's a little too ambitious at times and rein that in over time rather than a safe, unimaginative player. Most importantly, even if he does fail to connect on a pass or deke, it's rarely been in a vulnerable position where the opposition can quickly counter with an odd-man rush.\n\nIn addition to driving rushes and setting teammates up, Celebrini is also a lethal shooting threat. He can beat goalies clean from mid-range distances with a variety of shot types. Here's a goal where Celebrini finds soft ice, gets into a low stance and lets go with a lightning-quick release on a one-timer from the slot.\n\nCelebrini's one-timer is also a weapon on the power play where he's usually parked on the right circle. This isn't a Steven Stamkos caliber one-timer that you can build an NHL power play around, but when you couple it with Celebrini's wrist shot, puck skills and playmaking vision, he becomes a versatile power-play threat. As an example, here's a rocket one-timer that's perfectly placed over the goalie's shoulder.\n\nCelebrini can also excel down low offensively, which would be an asset for teams that like to attack in a heavier style. Off the puck, he's always moving his feet in the offensive zone, hunting for new lanes and openings. He also protects the puck well under pressure. Below, you'll see a play where he leans into the defender with the puck, cycles the puck down low, keeps moving his feet to get open and then whips a gorgeous backhand pass into the slot.\n\nHere's an offensive sequence that shows Celebrini's all-around offensive impact. He transports the puck up ice for a zone entry and his team starts cycling. As the cycle develops, Celebrini's off-puck movement down low causes the lone net-front player to abandon that area and follow him into the corner. Celebrini snaps a pass to his linemate in front, who's now in all alone for a high-danger chance because of the space created.\n\nCelebrini ticks virtually every box NHL teams look for in a top forward prospect: He's a strong skater, has excellent hands, high-end creativity and playmaking vision, a terrific shot and an industrious, complete 200-foot game. There are no glaring weaknesses or red flags in his game -- you'd have to split hairs to identify any.\n\nIf Celebrini doesn't have any obvious weaknesses, why isn't he a Connor Bedard/Auston Matthews/Connor McDavid caliber prospect, you might be wondering. When we're discussing a top-five player in the NHL (or a prospect with that potential like Bedard), they typically boast a specific attribute or skill that is borderline supernatural and completely unstoppable. With McDavid and MacKinnon it's their speed. With Matthews and Bedard it's their shot. With a player like Nikita Kucherov, it's the unparalleled way he sees the ice and how that powers his best-in-class playmaking.\n\nCelebrini is extremely talented but he doesn't quite have an offensive attribute that projects to hit that level. Because of that, he's unlikely to be a player that challenges for Art Ross Trophies or Rocket Richard awards. He may not even be a consistent 100-point producer. But when you combine Celebrini's excellent offensive foundation with his two-way chops, he still has franchise player potential and an opportunity to develop into one of the most well-rounded first-line centers in the NHL.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harman_dayal@theathletic.com", "name": "Harman Dayal", "type":

I've seen it happen before", "body": "By Dieter Kurtenbach | dkurtenbach@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nAfter 82 regular season games and more than 4,000 minutes on the ice, it seems reductive to say that the San Jose Sharks' 2023-24 season rides on Tuesday's NHL Draft Lottery.\n\nBut, well, it does.\n\nThe Sharks might be in a top-to-bottom rebuild, but we're now in year two of general manager Mike Grier's plan and the Sharks don't seem to be building towards anything.\n\nSure, the squad has some nice young depth pieces, but it's also looking for a new head coach.\n\nBut what it's really looking for is a star to guide it through this dark, dark night.\n\nThey could find one if luck (or NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's not-so-subtle hand) goes their way Tuesday. The Sharks have a 25.5 percent chance of winning the No. 1 overall pick. It's time fate goes their way.\n\nThere were three players in the history of the Hobey Baker Award -- college hockey's Heisman -- to win as a freshman: Hall of Famer Paul Kariya, Stanley Cup winner Jack Eichel, and Adam Fantilli, the No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft.\n\nMacklin Celebrini became the fourth this spring. He's the youngest player to win the award, and he won it as the youngest player in Division 1 college hockey.\n\nIf Celebrini wants, he can have a beer at a bar this summer. So long as he's in his native Canada, of course. He'll turn 18 on June 13.\n\n(He was born just weeks before I started college. Isn't getting old the best?)\n\nHe might be a kid, but Celebrini is the foundation piece for this unpinned Sharks franchise. He's the reward for two years of suffering for Sharks fans.\n\nAnd my goodness do the Sharks need to land him, because there's no next-best thing in this year's draft.\n\n(Plus, do you know who his dad is?)\n\nLast year, the Sharks missed out on a once-in-a-generation player in the draft lottery as Connor Bedard went No. 1 to the Blackhawks.\n\nBut that draft class was loaded. I maintain there were four elite, franchise-changing talents in that draft: Bedard, Fantilli, Leo Carlsson, and Matvei Michkov.\n\nThe Sharks landed the No. 4 pick in that draft and yet somehow didn't end up with one of them.\n\nNow, the player they did select, Will Smith, is no slouch. He led the NCAA in points this past season as a freshman. (Don't let all this freshman success fool you, college hockey is anything but a one-and-done environment.) But Smith is not a franchise changer.\n\nNot to put too much on the kid's shoulders, but Celebrini is.\n\nI grew up in Chicago as a die-hard Blackhawks fan. Forget Jeremy Roenick and Chris Chelios, I was raised on Tuomo Ruutu, Eric Daze, and Jocelyn Thibault. Hawks' home games weren't on local television, and the only thing I was fully convinced of in life was that so long as the Wirtz family owned the team, they would never win a Stanley Cup. It was a hopeless existence. (That might tell you something about me.)\n\nI remember the date I felt hope -- Oct. 19, 2007. It was a Wednesday.\n\nThat's when Jonathan Toews took the puck and center ice against the Colorado Avalanche in the first few minutes of his fifth NHL game.\n\nI was watching the Avs broadcast in my apartment in Columbia, Mo. (don't ask how I got that feed) as Toews weaved through three Colorado players and beat goalie Jose Theodore with a goal for the ages.\n\n\"This is the kind of talent,\" a giddy Avs analyst Peter McNab said. \"That can bring a franchise back from dead.\"\n\nA great call.\n\nYes, Patrick Kane -- the Blackhawks' No. 1 overall pick the proceeding summer -- might have scored more goals and points and went to three more All-Star Games, but McNab was right -- it was Toews on whom the Blackhawks dynasty was built.\n\nThat's because, no matter the era, nothing is as valuable as a two-way center in this league.\n\nToews had the sweet mitts and the ability to score goals from anywhere on the ice, but it was just as much his brilliant defensive play and elite understanding of the full 17,000 square feet of ice that was the foundation of three Stanley Cup wins.\n\nI watched nearly every game Toews played. And having spent the last few months checking in on Celebrini (it's so much easier to find those feeds these days), I'm convinced he's the second coming.\n\nCelebrini controls games. He's always in the right spot on the ice. He always seems to make the right play, even if that's just a simple, no-fuss pass. He simply operates on a different level than everyone else when he's on the ice.\n\nHe orchestrates.\n\nSure, his game has plenty of flash -- there's no doubt about that -- but his success is predicated on a deftness that you cannot teach.\n\nAnd while flash lands you on YouTube, deftness wins games.\n\nIt's so easy to imagine Celebrini unlocking William Ecklund and taking Fabian Zetterlund to another level.\n\nA 1-2 center punch of Celebrini and Smith in 2025-26? That's something to get excited about.\n\nToews always thrived with a true power forward on his wing -- Dustin Byfuglien and Andrew Ladd come to mind. Maybe top wing prospect Quentin Musty could be that player for Celebrini.\n\nAnd big Shakir Mukhamadullin gliding the blue line behind him? I'm starting to see the vision.\n\nBut that's my imagination working an extra few shifts.\n\nSadly, that's all we have with the Sharks right now -- imagination.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com",

Then what?", "body": "SAN JOSE - Winning this week's NHL Draft Lottery and selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall in June will not cure all that ails the San Jose Sharks.\n\nBut bringing in college hockey's best player from this past season, and potentially a No. 1 center for years to come, is not a bad start.\n\n\"One player's obviously not going to turn this thing around by himself,\" Sharks center Nico Sturm said in March. \"But I think we do miss players who are game changers, who can create something out of nothing.\"\n\nThe Sharks hope the ping pong balls bounce their way Tuesday when the NHL conducts its draft lottery in Secaucus, N.J. San Jose has a 25.5% chance, more than any other team, of ending up with the needed four-number combination.\n\nSo if the Sharks' numbers do come up, then what? After Sharks general manager Mike Grier and other members of the team's front office stand on stage inside the Las Vegas Sphere next month and select Celebrini with the No. 1 overall pick, what's the next step?\n\nTo be clear, Celebrini, still just 17 years old, does not have to sign with the Sharks this year and can return to Boston University for his sophomore season. San Jose would hold his signing rights for four years.\n\nAs a freshman, Celebrini scored 64 points in 38 games and won the Hobey Baker Award as college hockey's most valuable player. His 1.68 points per game average ranked second in NCAA Division I behind the 1.73 average of Sharks prospect Will Smith, who scored 71 points in 41 games for national finalist Boston College.\n\nBut assuming Celebrini turns pro, he, like any budding star, will need to be supported.\n\n\"Character's still a big part of the game, and you can't forget about that,\" said former NHL goalie and longtime analyst Darren Pang, now with TNT and NBC Sports in Chicago. \"Forget about how important it is not just on your team in your locker room, but also around the entire league. You want to be a respected group.\n\n\"The kids, whether it's Macklin Celebrini, Connor McDavid, or Nathan MacKinnon, you have to surround them with good people.\"\n\nThe Sharks have said they hope to do that this summer as some roster spots become available after a season in which they finished 19-54-9 for an NHL-worst 47 points.\n\nEight Sharks players are pending unrestricted free agents, and most will not be brought back. Other pending restricted free agents on expiring contracts might also not return, and trades are a distinct possibility.\n\nPer CapFriendly, the Sharks have about $49.5 million in salary cap commitments for next season. While Grier has said he won't spend big dollars on aging high-profile players, he will still have plenty of cap space to add the type of individuals he feels will enhance the team's culture and help form its identity.\n\n\"We definitely need to get faster, be harder to play against,\" Grier said in April. \"On my side, I think that's through free agency or trades, looking to add players that fit the bill. We have roster space and cap flexibility to add and target some guys.\n\n\"So, hopefully, whether that's through free agency or through trades, we'll be allowed to add some guys that fit that profile.\"\n\nThe Sharks have character players, including captain Logan Couture and alternate captains Mario Ferraro, Mikael Granlund, and Luke Kunin. Sturm is in that group, too, and they all learned what it takes to be a full-time NHL player from respected veterans.\n\nCouture learned from Sharks legends Patrick Marleau and Joe Thornton, and Ferraro was almost inseparable from Brent Burns. As younger players with the Minnesota Wild, Granlund, Kunin, and Sturm were all around Mikko Koivu, who played over 1,000 NHL games and captained the team for 11 years.\n\nIf Celebrini comes to the Sharks, he'll need that same level of mentorship.\n\n\"Probably one of the most professional players that I've been in a locker room with,\" Sturm said of Koivu, who retired after the 2020-2021 season. \"I've had the chance to learn from guys like that, and likewise, I tried to pass it along to our young guys in our organization.\"\n\n\"You want (young stars) to learn the game the right way,\" Pang said. \"Too many times, young kids are anointed in this league.\"\n\nAfter Chicago won last year's draft lottery, and right before the NHL draft in Nashville, where they selected Connor Bedard first overall, the Blackhawks supported the wunderkind center by acquiring Taylor Hall and Nick Foligno from the Boston Bruins.\n\nSoon after, Chicago also signed veteran Corey Perry to a one-year deal, although Perry was waived and cut by the team in late November for what it termed as \"unacceptable\" behavior.\n\nStill, the point of adding veterans was to try and ease Bedard's transition into the NHL and prevent players from other teams from taking liberties with him.\n\n\"I remember thinking you've got to surround this young man with good, character guys who are respected around the NHL,\" Pang said of the time after last year's lottery. \"Not players who will just drop the mitts and fight, but in the middle of a scrum when you've got a young player like Connor Bedard, a Nick Foligno who can get into that scrum and get the attention of the other players.\"\n\nCelebrini could join a group of Sharks prospects just starting their North American professional careers in the next year or two. All will need time to develop. Celebrini is considered NHL-ready; if not, he could spend time in the AHL with the Barracuda.\n\nSince Celebrini will be coming from the NCAA and not the CHL and will be 18 by then, he is eligible.\n\nIt's hard for anyone to develop in the NHL, Couture said, especially still-growing teenagers.\n\n\"It's massive,\" Couture said of his half-season in the AHL in 2009-2010 when he was 20. \"I wouldn't have been able to contribute at the NHL level without spending my (58) games in the American League. I'm of the belief, and people can tell me I'm wrong all day, but you need to dominate in the American League before you can play in the NHL.\n\n\"Rushing players is not a way for players to be successful. You do them a disservice, and in my opinion, it can ruin some players' careers.\"\n\nWhether the Sharks win the lottery or not, they are a long way from being a postseason contender again. This season, they finished 51 points out of a playoff spot, and the Blackhawks, with a generational talent like Bedard, were 46 points out.\n\nBut Celebrini would appear to be a good player to have for the Sharks.\n\n\"Let's say we draft first overall. All of a sudden next year, we're not going to be Stanley Cup contenders,\" Sturm said. \"That's obviously not how it works.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San

As a striker, Celebrini would rip up soccer pitches around his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both of his parents played college soccer, and he looked to be next in line. To this day, he admits he was naturally more gifted at soccer than hockey.\n\nIt's probably no coincidence that at the same time Celebrini and his siblings were rising through the youth sports machine, their dad Rick -- the Warriors' director of sports medicine and performance since 2018 -- was extolling the virtues of cross-sport training.\n\nSo Rick found time to coach Macklin and his older son, Aiden, in youth soccer.\n\n\"He could've been even a better soccer player than he (is) a hockey player,\" Aiden said.\n\nBut in a hockey-crazed country, Celebrini, now 17, chose the ice. His love for scoring goals didn't fade; he kept finding the net as a young kid in Canada, for the Jr. Sharks after his family moved to the Bay Area, and this past year at Boston University, where he became the youngest winner of the Hobey Baker Award -- the Heisman Trophy of college hockey.\n\nThe center could continue doing so with the moribund Sharks, who as this season's worst team, have a league-best 25 percent chance of winning Tuesday's NHL Draft Lottery. Their prize would be Celebrini, who has been on their radar for years thanks to his Bay Area sporting ties.\n\nTo some degree, any elite athlete's story is one of nature versus nurture. In Celebrini's rise to this moment, his spectrum is particularly noteworthy. A determined competitor, he has blended intrinsic skill with squeezing every bit of potential out of the rare opportunities afforded to him by his father's background.\n\n\"I think it's been massive for me,\" Celebrini told this news organization. \"Everything from injury prevention to different things to work on and understanding how an athlete works, the tolerance of an athlete -- all that knowledge kind of displayed onto us, it all helped massively in our development.\"\n\nRick isn't a mad scientist. He never forced any of his children to play sports.\n\nBut here they are, elite athletes anyway: Macklin soon the top pick, Aiden already drafted by the Canucks, Charlize, 15, one of the top Canadian players her age, and RJ, the youngest with perhaps the most potential in the rink.\n\n\"It's been around them their whole lives,\" Rick said, \"so I think they've just naturally gravitated to (sports).\"\n\nAs a toddler, Macklin would hit whiffle balls out of his grandparents' yard both as a lefty and right-handed hitter. As Rick tells it, the young Macklin boasted then that \"someday, people are going to watch me do this.\"\n\nAt around 3 years old, Macklin taught himself how to skate after watching his older brother at a \"cookie monster\" practice -- a hockey development program for little kids. The son of two collegiate athletes, he had innate ability.\n\nAn intangible drive, too, was also always there. During one of his first times on the ice in the cookie monster program, he lost the puck in front of the goal and slipped and fell behind the net. An opponent went for a breakaway, only for Macklin to catch him and knock it away with a dive on his belly.\n\n\"He could barely skate, but he just kind of chased the kid down,\" Rick said, noting that the \"pretty accomplished hockey coach\" in charge said he could not recall seeing effort like that before.\n\nMuch else was taught, though, by one of North America's brightest sports medicine minds, including cross-sport exposure.\n\n\"I feel like soccer helped me in so many ways, even ways I didn't really think about,\" Macklin told this news organization. \"Vision or spacing, just problem-solving. There's so many benefits to playing different sports.\"\n\nAfter getting his PhD in physical therapy at the University of British Columbia and playing pro soccer, Rick worked three Winter Olympics -- first as a physiotherapist for Canada's Alpine Ski Team and then as the 2010 games' chief therapist and medical manager. He became the Vancouver Whitecaps' team physiotherapist and co-founded the Fortius Institute, where he worked with close friend Steve Nash. In 2018, he joined the Warriors and soon became one of the most respected members of the organization.\n\nRick brought his work home with him, too. When his kids were little, he'd create obstacle courses for them on playgrounds, \"gamifying\" physical activity. During a flight delay at the Orlando airport after a trip to Disney World, he set up a sprinting circuit for the kids in the terminal.\n\n\"You're really trying to tease out multi-directional movement and cutting, change of direction, ducking under things and jumping over things,\" Rick said.\n\nPart of Rick's PhD research was in motor skill acquisition. In layman's terms: how to optimize movement. In Rick's terms: building a young athlete's \"physical literacy.\"\n\nOn beach vacations in Maui, Rick would lead his kids through sprints and hops in the sand. In another game, Rick would kick a soccer ball and have Macklin and Aiden race to retrieve it, critiquing their strides.\n\nThe Celebrini family's unofficial motto is \"What did you do today to get better?\"\n\nFor Macklin, that development has come to a head at the cusp of stardom. As the youngest player in college hockey, he totaled 64 points on 32 goals and 32 assists -- the only one this season to go 30/30.\n\nDuring the draft lottery, Macklin will be in Prague, representing Canada for the first time at the men's level, in the IIHF Men's World Championship. He'll play alongside Connor Bedard, last year's top pick who had high praise for him.\n\n\"He's a special player and what he's doing this year is remarkable. I don't know if it's ever been done at his age,\" Bedard said.\n\nMacklin's track record against every level of competition will give the Sharks, or any team picking first, confidence.\n\n\"What I liked most about him was his competitiveness,\" said Todd Marchant, the Sharks' director of player development who watched Celebrini at the world juniors. \"He's just one of those players that raises his game.\"\n\nWhile it would be nice for the Celebrinis if the Sharks drafted Macklin and kept him close to home, the center said he doesn't care which team picks him. Having up-close access to Nash, Steph Curry and other professional athletes his entire life has given Macklin a playbook on how to answer such inquires professionally.\n\nLike all college NHL draftees, he could choose to return to BU even after the draft. That decision will be made based on which situation he and his family deem best for his development.\n\nFor a Celebrini, that's just like any other day.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com",

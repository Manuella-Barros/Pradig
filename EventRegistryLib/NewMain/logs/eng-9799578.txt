Now prosecutors say they have found a litany of disturbing and threatening social media posts from Nelson concerning a variety of public officials and that he should be put back in jail since he poses a danger to the public.\n\nIn August 2023, prosecutors allege Nelson posted an image online of a Georgia state judge handling the Donald Trump election interference case with \"apparent crosshairs drawn on his head.\"\n\nThe judge handling the currently waylaid racketeering case in Georgia alleging Trump and several others engaged in a \"fake electors\" scheme is Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is not named in the detention order for Nelson.\n\nIn February 2024, prosecutors allege Nelson posted an image of New York Attorney General Letitia James -- who handled Trump's civil fraud prosecution -- with crosshairs on her head too. This time, the photo was accompanied by threatening commentary from Nelson allegedly including: \"give every [expletive] thing I have to watch that [expletive]'s head explode, or at least the back of her head blowout.\"\n\nAnd then, in June, mere hours after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Fischer v. United States agreeing to narrow the application of an obstruction statute used to prosecute Jan. 6 rioters, Nelson allegedly set eyes on Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nBarrett, appointed by former President Donald Trump, broke with her conservative colleagues in a sharply written dissenting opinion in Fischer v. United States.\n\nShe wrote, as Law&Crime reported, that it was clear the certification of the election on Jan. 6, 2021, by Congress was an \"official proceeding\" under the meaning of the obstruction statute at challenge. Attempts by the high court's majority to narrow the statute by suggesting that it only applied to the obstruction of official documents or records struck Barrett as nonsensical. She called out the majority for engaging in \"textual backflips\" to reach its conclusion.\n\n\"I pray to God with all my [expletive] heart that somebody cuts your [expletive] throat from ear to ear you worthless piece of [expletive],\" Nelson allegedly wrote hours after that dissent was published.\n\nThat post also included an image of the justice.\n\nThe alleged threat against Attorney General Garland came in July. Nelson posted a photo of Garland with crosshairs on his head too, according to prosecutors.\n\nThere were videos from June 28 that he posted online less than 10 minutes apart as well, according to prosecutors, and in each, he lashed out at the FBI, even offering in one clip to \"get into 'the MMA ring with you two pieces of [expletive].\"\n\nMMA is an abbreviation for mixed martial arts.\n\nIn one of those alleged threats, he also referred to the \"FBI [expletive] math teacher.\"\n\n\"The government proffers that the lead case agent in this investigation was a math teacher before joining the FBI,\" an Aug. 6 opinion and order to detain Nelson notes.\n\nNelson referred to a second FBI agent who interviewed him following his initial March 2023 arrest as well. Notably, Nelson referred to that agent as a \"Stabler-looking person,\" referring to a character on the television show \"Law&Order: SVU\" known as Elliot Stabler.\n\nNelson was described by agents as being so aggressive with them following his first March 2023 interview that a U.S. Marshal had to escort one of the FBI agents to their car due to safety concerns.\n\nNelson was ordered into detention on Tuesday and will be held until his bond revocation hearing next week. It seems unlikely he would be granted release in the wake of increasing threats against public officials like Vice President Kamala Harris and a recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\n\nLaw&Crime reported on Monday that a man who threatened to \"personally pluck out\" the vice president's eyes was arrested in Virginia.\n\nNelson was set to go to trial on Sept. 18 until prosecutors had requested proceedings be continued for at least 45 days so the case and pretrial discovery could be tweaked in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Fischer. Now a pretrial conference is set for Nov. 21 with a trial date of Dec. 10.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the Jan. 6 charges which include: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752(a)(1)- Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752(a)(2)- Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 5104(e)(2)(D)- Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol

[Expletive] off,\" he allegedly wrote.\n\nIn one of those alleged threats, he also referred to the \"FBI [expletive] math teacher.\"\n\n\"The government proffers that the lead case agent in this investigation was a math teacher before joining the FBI,\" an Aug. 6 opinion and order to detain Nelson notes.\n\nNelson referred to a second FBI agent who interviewed him following his initial March 2023 arrest as well. Notably, Nelson referred to that agent as a \"Stabler-looking person,\" referring to a character on the television show \"Law&Order: SVU\" known as Elliot Stabler.\n\nNelson was described by agents as being so aggressive with them following his first March 2023 interview that a U.S. Marshal had to escort one of the FBI agents to their car due to safety concerns.\n\nNelson was ordered into detention on Tuesday and will be held until his bond revocation hearing next week. It seems unlikely he would be granted release in the wake of increasing threats against public officials like Vice President Kamala Harris and a recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\n\nLaw&Crime reported on Monday that a man who threatened to \"personally pluck out\" the vice president's eyes was arrested in Virginia.\n\nNelson was set to go to trial on Sept. 18 until prosecutors had requested proceedings be continued for at least 45 days so the case and pretrial discovery could be tweaked in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Fischer. Now a pretrial conference is set for Nov. 21 with a trial date of Dec. 10.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the Jan. 6 charges which include: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752(a)(1)- Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1752(a)(2)- Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 5104(e)(2)(D)- Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building; and 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 5104(e)(2)(G)- Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"},

He is due to appear in court next week to determine whether the detention will continue until his December trial.\n\n\"While there is no history of prior release violations, these statements evidence an actionable threat to the community - at the least, law enforcement involved in the investigation,\" Austin wrote in his order.\n\nProsecutors said Nelson over the past year has posted images of Garland, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) and a Georgia state judge with apparent crosshairs drawn on their heads.\n\nThe Georgia judge appears to be Scott McAfee, who has been overseeing Trump's Georgia election interference criminal case.\n\nCourt documents indicate the post about James, who brought a major civil fraud prosecution against Trump that led to a $464 million judgment, also included a threatening comment: \"give every [expletive] thing I have to watch that [expletive]'s head explode, or at least the back of her head blowout.\"\n\nAnd in June, prosecutors say Nelson made a threatening post about Barrett, Trump's final appointee to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe post was allegedly made roughly one hour after the Supreme Court narrowed the use of an obstruction charge levied against hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, including Nelson. Barrett wrote the dissent, siding with prosecutors alongside two of the court's liberals.\n\n\"I pray to God with all my [expletive] heart that somebody cuts your [expletive] throat from ear to ear you worthless piece of [expletive],\" Nelson's comment read, according to court documents.\n\nThe magistrate judge, however, raised greater concerns about the defendant's alleged posts about two FBI agents involved in his case. Nelson allegedly posted two videos directing angry and threatening comments toward the agents, including offering to get into \"the MMA ring\" with them.\n\n\"The Court does not, in any way, disregard or minimize statements concerning state and federal judges and attorneys general,\" the judge wrote. \"Those comments and rhetoric are even more offensive and violent than the agent-focused statements. Moreover, they support concerns that Nelson might resort to violence in the future.\"\n\nThe judge added, \"Yet, the Court is mindful of its directive to consider not only the nature of any alleged threats but also Mr. Nelson's resources and capabilities.\"\n\nIn connection with the Jan. 6 riot, Nelson faces charges like obstruction, entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct. Prosecutors say Nelson in the lead up to Jan. 6 expressed a desire to commit violence against then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and others. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nA court docket shows Nelson is due to appear in court next Wednesday in Washington, D.C., before the judge who has been overseeing his Jan. 6 case to determine whether to keep him behind bars until his trial, which is scheduled to begin Dec. 10.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Nelson was seen on surveillance footage at the Capitol during the riots when supporters of former President Donald Trump attempted to stop the counting of votes for the 2020 election.\n\nIn July, U.S. District Judge John Bates revoked Nelson's pretrial release and issued an arrest warrant. Next Wednesday, Bates will preside over a hearing to decide if Nelson should remain detained until his trial for charges related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nMagistrate Judge Charles Austin issued an order this week detailing the different social media posts made by Nelson, which included threats to Barrett and other prominent public officials.\n\nLast month, Nelson shared a post on social media which showed Attorney General Merrick Garland with what appeared to be a crosshairs on his head. Garland previously appointed Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting the case against Trump in connection to the January 6 riots at the Capitol.\n\nNelson made another similar post in June where he allegedly threatened Barrett after she issued a dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court's case involving the obstruction charges handed down to many Capitol rioters. According to Austin's order, Nelson said that he hoped someone would cut Barrett's throat \"from ear to ear.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court previously issued its ruling in the Fischer v. United States case, agreeing that federal prosecutors went too far in bringing obstruction charges against January 6 defendants.\n\nNelson also made similar threats against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the civil fraud case against Trump, resulting in the former president being required to pay over $300 million in penalties.\n\nAccording to the order from Judge Austin, Nelson shared a post on social media showing James crosshairs on her face and said he wanted to see her \"head explode, or at least the back of her head blowout.\"\n\nNelson is also accused of sharing other social media videos where he spoke about his hatred for certain FBI agents assigned to his specific January 6 case.\n\n\"The government describes Nelson as becoming so 'verbally combative and confrontational' towards one agent that a deputy United States Marshal escorted the agent to their car due to safety concerns,\" the order from Austin stated.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

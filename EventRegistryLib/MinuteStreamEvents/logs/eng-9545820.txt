The picturesque setting of Bodkin, Ireland adds to the series' appeal. Bodkin delves into the impact of podcasts on storytelling and the unraveling of its characters.\n\nIn 2018, former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama founded Higher Ground Productions. Their multi-year deal sought to bring both scripted and unscripted films and series to Netflix to give a more diverse voice to entertainment. Their first foray was the 2019 documentary American Factory, which won the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award the next year. They have produced several films and series over the past five years, but this year marks their first scripted series with Bodkin.\n\nCreated by Jez Scharf, the seven-episode series stars Will Forte as Gilbert, an American podcaster who is off to Bodkin, Ireland in an attempt to solve the mystery of three people who disappeared during a Samhain festival decades earlier. Joining him is his research assistant, Emmy (Robyn Caryn), and an Irish investigative journalist, Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen). Although comedy is Forte's specialty, Bodkin, while having a few darkly comic moments, is something more serious and sinister. Going in, the Saturday Night Live veteran might be the name you know, but when it's all over, he won't be the one you remember the most.\n\nBodkin (2024)\n\nA group of podcasters set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in an idyllic Irish town. But when they start to pull the strings, they find a story much bigger and stranger than they could have imagined.\n\nRelease Date May 9, 2024 Cast Will Forte , Siobh\u00e1n Cullen , Robyn Cara , David Wilmot , Chris Walley Seasons 1 Creator(s) Jez Scharf Writers Jez Scharf Streaming Service(s) Netflix\n\nWhat Is 'Bodkin' About?\n\nFilms and series about podcasters trying to solve a mystery are all the rage at the moment, and none may be doing it better than Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. At an initial glance, Bodkin, which stars three different characters, with one of the leads being a popular comic actor, might draw dismissals as a clone -- but this show is no copycat. Although it's labeled as a comedy, outside a few darkly humorous moments, it's as serious as a series like this can get. The comedy it does have is not forced, but rather an awkward symptom of the residents of Bodkin due to the suppression of the mystery they're surrounded by.\n\nBodkin centers on Dove (Cullen), an investigative journalist from Ireland, who left the country due to controversy and moved to England. There, she has found even more troubles. Unable to solve a case in Bodkin, Ireland about the disappearance of three young people during the Samhain festival decades earlier, Dove is informed by her boss that he's bringing in an American podcaster to help her. Enter Will Forte's Gilbert, who is Dove's exact opposite. She is a serious person, one with such a dour expression and bad attitude that we know there has to be a story there, who detests that a lowly podcast host is being sent to assist her. Gilbert, on the other hand, is the happy-go-lucky American excited about the opportunity to meet people and tell a new story for his show. For him, this is an adventure, and accompanying him is his assistant researcher, a wannabe podcaster named Emmy (Caryn).\n\nBodkin is a beautiful, coastal town, a little place with old buildings, narrow streets, and rolling green hills, just like you imagine a village in Ireland would be like. It's the ideal contrasting backdrop, a place of beauty and peacefulness, for a plot that centers on young people gone missing and hidden secrets. As one character tells our heroes, Ireland has never even had a serial killer before. Now, however, something evil has happened in Bodkin, and it's up to a trio who doesn't like each other to figure it out, exposing the town's hidden past while their own trauma gets exposed in the process.\n\nWill Forte Breaks Away From His Traditional Comic Approach in 'Bodkin'\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWill Forte is well-known for playing outlandish characters, whether it be from his years on SNL, the underrated FOX series The Last Man on Earth, or as the foul-mouthed dog hater in last year's Strays. There has often been some seriousness underneath those over-the-top characters (he is terrifying in Strays, actually), and in Bodkin, Forte tones down his high-energy comedic approach to play Gilbert, who is at once an extrovert who loves to meet people and hear their stories while also being filled with inner turmoil.\n\nGilbert uses his charm and genuinely fascinated-by-everything personality to get the townsfolk of Bodkin to trust him. Many are excited to hear that he is a podcaster. They immediately smile, let down their guard, and open up to him in a way they wouldn't if he was a cop, or a traditional reporter like Dove. Bodkin uses their reactions, even from people in such a small town so far away, to show how deep the new podcast obsession goes. That desire to dig deep into someone else's life and know all of their secrets is fascinating, no matter where you're from. It's not fascinating, though, if you're the one who has a secret that needs to be kept that way. Gilbert doesn't know what to do when he comes across townsfolk who don't want to speak to him at all, treating him like a cancer who has invaded their solitude and simple lives. Here, Bodkin is saying even more about the podcast wave and how it can dig too deep, and involves real trauma behind the storytelling.\n\nMoreover, Gilbert has his own trauma. He might come off as happy and excitable, but he's so much of a people pleaser that he'll drink himself silly to fit in and get himself caught up in some life-risking gambling debts. His obsession with podcasting has also harmed his own life, with his actions pushing his wife away in a way that can't be fixed. This is mostly handled well, but there is one scene, the only brief time we meet Gilbert's wife when she comes to visit, that is so clich\u00e9d that you've seen it a hundred times before and know exactly where it's going. It's one of Bodkin's few weaknesses, as it falls prey to one too many tropes of the genre.\n\nRelated 'Bodkin': Everything We Know About Will Forte's Netflix True Crime Parody Could this be Netflix's answer to 'Only Murders in the Building'?\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen, Robyn Cara, and David Wilmot Are the True Stars of 'Bodkin'\n\nClose\n\nWill Forte shows off his acting range as Gilbert, but he's not the most memorable star of Bodkin. That distinction goes to Dove. Siobh\u00e1n Cullen is coming off of another TV series, The Dry, but Bodkin could make her an international star. Dove is a bit of a clich\u00e9 herself at first, that grumpy and serious character who hates everyone and just wants to solve the case herself. One scene even has her flip off a small child who has the guts to compliment her sunglasses, which she wears often. As the episodes go on, we learn more of her own story, and it's one even more tragic than Gilbert's. While he covers up his pain by ignoring it, Dove lives it full-time, destroyed by the guilt of how one of her stories led to someone's death. She's arguably a little bit one-note at first, but as Bodkin peels back the layers, she becomes fascinating. Whenever Dove makes any headway with the missing persons case, she opens up a little, letting others and the viewer see more of the real person inside.\n\nGilbert's sidekick assistant, Emmy, doesn't have much to do in the beginning other than stand in her boss' shadow. She's new to this, living the fantasy without knowing what to do. She soon shows that she can hold her own with anyone, and, through wanting to be both like Gilbert and dreaming of being like Dove one day, is a bit of both of them. Bodkin shows us someone young at the beginning of their journey who could end up like either Gilbert or Dove if she's not careful.\n\nThere are two main flaws of Bodkin, starting with the fact that we never get to know much about the people who disappeared. It makes it harder for us to care about their story being solved when we have no attachment to them. We also have a scarce attachment to Gilbert, Dove, and Emmy as a group for most of the series. They have little chemistry together, which may have been purposeful, but in the final few episodes, they begin to click more as they find commonality, rather than focusing on the disdain that can get repetitive.\n\nOne character, however, helps remedy both of these issues. A bearded man who lives in the town named Seamus (David Wilmot) becomes a focal point in Bodkin when there are too many characters being interviewed. He is more mysterious than the main mystery itself, a man who is always angry and ready to hurt someone (he takes a staple gun to one man's chest), but who also forms a bit of a respect with Gilbert and his group. Seamus can either be friend or foe, but you'll have to wait until the end to find out which.\n\nBodkin isn't as good as similar series, but it only gets better as each episode unfolds. It starts out with too many tropes and characters who don't always click, but by the end, it finds its way and sticks the landing with a finale that's both frightening and sweet. Bodkin is a series about telling stories that don't want to be told -- not just someone else's, but Gilbert's, Dove's, and Emmy's as well.\n\nBodkin (2024)\n\nBodkin's setup has been done before, but the unraveling of its compelling characters make it a fascinating watch even when the mystery lacks.\n\n7 10\n\nPros Will Forte inhabits a character we haven't seen him portray before. The setting of Bodkin, Ireland is a beautiful backdrop. The series explores deeper themes about the effects of podcasts and their rising popularity. Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, Robyn Cara, and David Wilmot steal the show. Cons We barely get to know the disappeared people who are the subject of the podcast. Too many townsfolk earn the focus early on in the series. Gilbert and Dove's characters are relegated to familiar tropes at times. Gilbert, Dove, and Emmy don't have much chemistry in early episodes.\n\nBodkin is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nWATCH ON NETFLIX", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shawn_van_horn@collider.com", "name": "Shawn Van Horn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher Ground Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Walley_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Walley (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bodkin-netflix-poster-social-featured.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Only Murders, in particular, has become one of the most popular shows on streaming, so it makes sense that Hulu's competitors may want to create something in a similar vein. Now, it looks like Netflix has what could be their answer to Only Murders in the Building with the new true crime podcast-inspired comedy Bodkin.\n\nThe new Netflix series follows two American true crime podcasters, Gilbert (Will Forte) and Emmy (Robyn Cara), who are in a desperate search for an exciting new story. Their quest takes them to the humble Irish hamlet of Bodkin, where they hire a local Irish journalist named Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen) to help them find some dirt on this immaculate community. It may begin as a fool's errand, but the more the trio discovers about Bodkin, the more they find evidence of Ireland's first-ever serial killer. To find out more about Will Forte's ambitious dramedy and its cast, trailer, release date, and more, here is everything we know so far about Bodkin.\n\nBodkin (2024)\n\nA cutting-edge artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize society but also poses a threat to individual autonomy. A young programmer finds himself at the heart of a conspiracy that could alter the course of humanity. He must decipher friend from foe in a world where technology blurs the lines between right and wrong.\n\nRelease Date May 9, 2024 Cast Will Forte , Siobh\u00e1n Cullen , Robyn Cara , David Wilmot , Chris Walley Main Genre Comedy Creator(s) Jez Scharf Writers Jez Scharf\n\nWhen is 'Bodkin' Coming Out?\n\nThe search for Ireland's first serial killer begins when all seven episodes of Bodkin premiere on Thursday, May 9th, 2024.\n\nWhere Can You Watch 'Bodkin'?\n\nBodkin will be making its streaming home exclusively on Netflix once it premieres on May the 9th. Netflix has become the home to some incredible content from across the pond. Just last month, Netflix had yet another surprise smash hit with Baby Reindeer - a difficult to watch yet incredibly profound look into a stand-up comedian's traumatic past and his ongoing torment by a serial stalker. May also happens to be the month that one of Netflix's biggest current shows, Bridgerton, will be returning for its third season.\n\nDoes 'Bodkin' Have a Trailer?\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nNetflix released the first trailer for Bodkin on April 2nd, 2024, officially starting the mystery of this once-quiet European town. Gilbert and Emmy are both very clearly here because they want fame and fortune through the breaking of a story nobody has ever heard before. They contrast completely with their partner, Dove, who at first helps the American duo only so she can get some extra cash. The more they sleuth through the town, however, the more they find evidence of a grisly and deadly serial murderer who may be linked to at least three separate missing people. As these amateur detectives continue to dig deeper for answers, they predictably garner the attention of some unsavory and dangerous characters. This does little to sway them, as Gilber and Emmy are determined to get famous for their breakout story while Dove simply wants to expose a vile killer.\n\nWho Stars in 'Bodkin'?\n\nFirst up in the cast of Bodkin is comedian and Saturday Night Live alumni Will Forte. Perhaps best-known for his MacGyver parody MacGruber, Forte has a long history in the world of comedy, having previously starred in hit comedic stories such as The Last Man on Earth and more dramatic tales like Sweet Tooth. Most recently, Forte's work has primarily been rooted in animated comedy, recently having a starring role in Scoob!, The Great North, and the revival of Clone High. Forte is joined in the series by Trying star Robyn Cara as Emmy and The Dry star Siobh\u00e1n Cullen as Dove.\n\nThe rest of the cast of Bodkin includes:\n\nDavid Wilmot (Anna Karenina) Chris Walley (The Last Voyage of the Demeter) Se\u00e1n \u00d3g Cairns (Find Me in Paris) David Pearse (The Banshees of Inisherin) Peter Bankol\u00e9 (Peaky Blinders) Kerri McLean (The Ritual) Marouane Zotti (I May Destroy You) Charlie Kelly (Dublin Murders) Clodagh Mooney Duggan (Dub Daze) Fergus Mulligan (Clean Sweep)\n\nWhat is the Plot of 'Bodkin'?\n\nThe official plot synopsis of Bodkin reads as follows:\n\nBodkin is a darkly comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in an idyllic, coastal Irish town.

The series revolves around a long-standing mystery filled with intriguing characters and conflicting journalists. Bodkin draws inspiration from real-life Irish mysteries, such as the Sophie Toscan du Plantier case, adding depth to the storyline. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nIn the dark comedy thriller Bodkin, a group of podcasters arrive at an idyllic Irish town hoping to uncover the truth behind a long-forgotten disappearance, only to be confronted with a mystery bigger than they ever imagined. A joint production between Netflix and Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, this series delivers an engrossing mystery enveloped in Irish culture and humor that occasionally leans into stereotypes. As the truth behind the puzzle of Bodkin is slowly revealed, the unique eccentricities of its population come to the forefront as it becomes obvious that everyone has something to hide.\n\nBodkin is a Netflix original series starring Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, and Robyn Cara. The series follows podcasters who set out to find the truth behind the disappearance of three strangers in a small town. But as they investigate, they discover the town is hiding a darker secret.\n\nPros Cons\n\nBodkin is set in a fictional West Cork town where three people vanished 27 years before, and the truth behind their disappearances was never discovered. When Gilbert (Will Forte), an American podcaster with Irish roots, Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), an investigative journalist from Dublin, and Emmy (Robyn Cara), an ambitious researcher, start asking questions, the residents of Bodkin make it clear they would rather let the past be the past. As the group continues to push for information, they find this is far from a cold case, but every answer they discover brings up more questions.\n\nThe Balance Between Comedy & Drama Makes Bodkin Unique Will Forte and Siobh\u00e1n Cullen work well as mismatched reporters\n\nThe seven-episode series was created by Jez Scharf and executive produced by the Obamas as Higher Ground's first scripted series after previously producing acclaimed politically charged documentaries like American Factory. While the studio has branched out to feature films such as the biographical drama Rustin, Bodkin is uncharted territory for the company and signals a move toward more mainstream productions without as strong of a political slant. Bodkin bodes well for this new direction. Although it does not live up to mystery thrillers like Broadchurch or The Night Of, Bodkin's blend of comedy and drama make it stand out.\n\nWhile Bodkin is based around a long-dormant mystery that begs to be solved, the true driving force of the series is the conflicting philosophies of Gilbert and Dove. Gilbert is a cheery optimist whose podcasting style is to become a part of the community and, through friendship and trust, gain insight into the town's secrets. In contrast, Dove is a hardened political reporter with difficulties forming positive relationships, who would much rather squeeze the truth out of a source than wait for them to share.\n\nForte channels his comedic skill and previous experience on Saturday Night Live to make Gilbert a likable, albeit often gullible, protagonist.\n\nGilbert and Dove's conflicting work ethic is a major source of tension as they struggle to work together and solve Bodkin's mystery effectively. Forte channels his comedic skill and previous experience on Saturday Night Live to make Gilbert a likable, albeit often gullible, protagonist, while Cullen's character is often so brash, pessimistic, and impulsive as to be somewhat off-putting. Dove does improve throughout the series, but there are occasions where it's unclear how the audience should feel about her as she dismisses her colleagues and comes across as rather rude and unlikable.\n\nThe other central throughline of Bodkin is its residents, who include secretive nuns, psychopathic fishermen, a tech millionaire, and everybody in between. Even the police seem to be holding something back, so part of the fun of watching Bodkin is analyzing each character and trying to decipher the meaning behind their words and how their secretive nature plays into the mysterious disappearance from so many years before. Some of the show's funniest moments come from these residents, as their unique mannerisms give Bodkin its distinct style.\n\nThere are many references to Irish mythology, Guinness drinking, Sean-n\u00f3s singing, and just about every other Irish stereotype out there.\n\nThe mystery of Bodkin revolves around the ancient Irish festival of Samhain, which the village has not celebrated since the disappearances. This is not the only way that Bodkin utilizes Irish culture and heritage, as throughout the series, there are many references to Irish mythology, Guinness drinking, Sean-n\u00f3s singing, and just about every other Irish stereotype out there. While the use of Irish culture as the backdrop of Netflix projects has failed in the past, like in the inaccurate depiction of Ireland in Linsday Lohan's Irish Wish, in Bodkin, the writers seem to have done their research.\n\nThe best thing about Bodkin is its tone, as it walks the notoriously fine line between comedy and drama, which, if not done correctly, could have felt more like a parody than a compelling thriller. Overall, it can't be denied that Bodkin works better as a mystery than a comedy, but the way the series uses humor to draw us in before keeping us hooked on a perplexing crime must be commended. The writing and intrigue of Bodkin are quite strong, but not every joke lands as well as intended, and occasionally, these conflicting genres clash with one another.\n\nBodkin (2024) ComedyDramaThriller\n\nCast Will Forte , Siobh\u00e1n Cullen , Robyn Cara , David Wilmot , Chris Walley Release Date May 9, 2024 Seasons 1 Streaming Service(s) Netflix Writers Jez Scharf Main Genre Comedy Creator(s) Jez Scharf Expand Bodkin Brings To Mind A Real-Life West Cork Mystery This is not the first time a group of podcasters has come to Ireland searching for answers\n\nIt's impossible to talk about Bodkin without referring to a real-life Irish coastal mystery that must have influenced the creator and writers. Bodkin has several parallels to the case of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, who, in 1996, was killed outside her holiday home in West Cork and decades later became the subject of a podcast series called West Cork. While the mystery seen in Bodkin is quite different from this real-life case, much of the dialogue surrounding \"blow-ins\" and a small Irish town where everybody seems to have a secret is noticeably similar.\n\nBodkin is a strong debut for Higher Ground in the realm of scripted series, and if they maintain this high level of production value, they will surely keep their reputation as one of Netflix's most exciting collaborators. Forte, Cullen, and the supporting cast give strong performances that make Bodkin feel like a lived-in world with an intriguing history. While the tonal inconsistencies and the occasionally convoluted mystery mean Bodkin is not among the very best of its genre, it's a worthy addition to the world of mystery thrillers, and its comedic charm gives it a unique edge.\n\nBodkin is now available to stream on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_dumaraog@screenrant.com", "name": "Ana Dumaraog", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cathal_gunning@screenrant.com", "name": "Cathal Gunning", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sean_morrison@screenrant.com", "name": "Sean Morrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kaashif_hajee@screenrant.com", "name": "Kaashif Hajee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher Ground Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Stage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_P.D._(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago P.D.

Cast members like Siobh\u00e1n Cullen bring authenticity to the Irish setting, despite the story being purely fictional. Show creator Jez Scharf and director Bronwen Hughes deliver a solid miniseries with engaging mysteries and characters.\n\nThe Netflix mystery series Bodkin is centered around a true crime podcast, but is it based on a true story? Bodkin, which was released in its entirety exclusively on Netflix on May 9, 2024, is a 7-episode miniseries that takes place entirely in a small coastal town in Ireland. The series was created by British writer Jez Scharf, whose previous works include Mister Biscuits (2018), Groucho Nietzsche (2014), and The UnDream (2013), and was directed in part by Bronwen Hughes (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul,13 Reasons Why). Bodkin opened to solid reviews, earning a 70% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\nBodkin follows Saturday Night Live alum Will Forte's happy-go-lucky protagonist Gilbert, a professional podcaster who travels to the small fictitious town of Bodkin, Ireland. Gilbert is accompanied by Emmy (Robyn Cara), his ambitious yet inexperienced assistant, and Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), a no-nonsense investigative journalist who is running from a dark past of her own. Upon arriving in Bodkin, Gilbert, Dove, and Emmy are accompanied by Sean O'Shea (Chris Walley), a local Bodkin townie hired to be their driver during their stay. The longer the three journalists stay in Bodkin, the more mysteries they discover.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nNetflix's Bodkin Is Not Based On A Real Story\n\nEverything in Bodkin is a complete work of fiction, even the town\n\nClose\n\nAlthough the Netflix series Bodkin feels grounded in reality, the overall narrative is not directly tied to any one true story in particular. This means that Forte's character is not based on an actual person, nor are any of the characters intended to depict real-life people, although Forte's Gilbert certainly embodies a certain type of podcaster. On the other hand, while Siobh\u00e1n Cullen's Dove is also a fictional character, the actress is truly from Dublin, Ireland, which adds authenticity and legitimacy to Bodkin's fictional setting.\n\nIn addition, David Wilmot, who plays Seamus in Bodkin, is an award-winning stage and screen actor from Ireland as well. Most of the supporting and background characters in Bodkin's cast are also rooted in Ireland or the United Kingdom, which is even more reason to assume that Bodkin is based on a true story. While it is not, and Bodkin is not a real place in Ireland, it is entirely possible Bodkin was inspired in part by the West Cork podcast, which explored an unsolved murder in the small Irish town of Schull.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nBodkin Parodies Elements Of More Sensational True Crime Podcasts\n\nBodkin shares common themes and critiques on the sensationalism in true crime entertainment\n\nDespite Bokdin's trailer claiming the series to be \"Based on a true story...overheard at a pub\", executive producer Alex Metcalf confirmed that it is \"Not a real story, not a real place. It's a fake town, it's a fake place. It's all fake people. The mystery itself, we worked very hard to find something that is in no way adjacent to a real true crime story. The fictionality of it was very deliberate.\" (via Tudum). What Bodkin does capture accurately, however, is a realistic sense of the inherent sensationalism of murder and true crime podcasts, turning these themes on their head to offer a satirical perspective.\n\nOther real-life, true crime podcasts can be a bit ghoulish in how they chase a story, upending small towns and the various people, even victims, involved with murders. It's a recurring theme in Bodkin that the townspeople don't want to revisit or dig up the past, and with plenty of good reason. Bodkin is also reminiscent of Black Mirror season 6, episode 2 \"Loch Henry\", which touches on many of the same thematic, narrative, and locational points regarding true crime entertainment. \"Loch Henry\" takes place in Scotland, not Ireland, and the characters make a documentary, not a podcast but in both cases, the small town's dark past is revealed, and true crime content is parodied.\n\nBodkin (2024) ComedyDramaThriller\n\nBodkin is a Netflix original series starring Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, and Robyn Cara. The series follows podcasters who set out to find the truth behind the disappearance of three strangers in a small town. But as they investigate, they discover the town is hiding a darker secret.\n\nCast Will Forte , Siobh\u00e1n Cullen , Robyn Cara , David Wilmot , Chris Walley Release Date May 9, 2024 Seasons 1

Set in the eponymous Irish town, the plot revolves around three individuals coming together to solve a mystery that is several decades old. Gilbert Power is a well-known podcaster long past his heyday. Dove is a journalist from London facing a professional crisis. Emmy is a doe-eyed young researcher prepared to accompany the other two to hell and back. The three podcasters soon discover that the real mystery lies not where they initially thought. If you want to know whether there will be a second season of Bodkin, this is what we have learned.\n\nHere's all the Bodkin Season 2 release date information we know so far, and all the details on when it is coming out.\n\nIs there a Bodkin Season 2 release date?\n\nBodkin Season 2 does not have an official release date, but it will be announced in the future.\n\nAs of early May 2024, Netflix has not greenlit the sophomore season of Bodkin. As the series just premiered, Netflix will likely assess how it performs with the viewers before deciding on Bodkin's future. The streaming giant generally lists its limited series as such, and Bodkin doesn't have that tag. So, we can speculate that Netflix and the series creators probably have a long-term plan for the series.\n\nThe cast of Bodkin includes Will Forte as Gilbert Power, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen as Dove, and Robyn Cara as Emmy. The cast also features Chris Walley as Sean O'Shea and David Wilmot as Seamus Gallagher.\n\nThis is because season 1 of Bodkin came out on the same platform.

Dove, Gilbert, and Emmy lead the investigation into mysterious disappearances, uncovering a larger conspiracy in a small Irish town. Ireland's stunning backdrop adds to the allure of the show, with unexpected twists challenging perceptions of truth and self-justification.\n\nBodkin perfectly combines the podcast fever that has recently taken hold of society with the true crime obsession that continues to percolate in every corner of the entertainment industry. Premiering on May 9, the 7-episode show follows a ragtag group of would-be podcasters who travel to a coastal Irish town in order to gather stories about a mysterious trio of disappearances. Their human interest angle from the past soon gives way to a full-blown investigation in the present, however, with surprises in store for everyone involved.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen leads the cast of Bodkin as Dove, an investigative journalist with unconventional research methods who thinks she has better things to do than track down such a small-fry story. But once her nose for sleuthing uncovers a larger conspiracy, she drags her coworkers Gilbert (Will Forte) and Emmy (Robyn Cara) full speed ahead into dangerous waters. The show was created by Jez Scharf, serving as the first television series under the Higher Ground Productions banner, and counts Barack and Michelle Obama among its executive producers.\n\nRelated Will Forte's 10 Best Movies, Ranked According To IMDb\n\nWill Forte is known for his comedic performances. However, he plays several different roles in his best movies like Nebraska and Good Boys.\n\nScreen Rant interviewed Forte, Cullen, and Cara about their upcoming Netflix series, what each character could stand to learn from the others in Bodkin season 1, and why Ireland is the perfect place for aspiring podcasters film.\n\n\"Everybody Learns From Everybody\" In Bodkin Season 1\n\nScreen Rant: Siobh\u00e1n, Dove isn't too happy about being stuck in Bodkin on a podcast gig when she's a hard-nosed investigative journalist. How does her point of view shift over the course of the season?\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen: Yeah, I think when we first meet her, she's in a really bad place. She's going through not only a crisis in her career but a personal crisis as well. And I think being forced back to Ireland, a place that she has a lot of negative connotations with and a place that holds a lot of trauma for her, forces [her] to face all those demons.\n\nIn doing so, she confronts them and sort of acknowledges the effects that they've had on her as a person and the beliefs that she holds. She goes on quite the journey, I believe. Yeah,\n\nWill, I feel like Gilbert's almost in the opposite place. He's super chill starting off with this podcast gig and almost has to be dragged into the investigation by the other two. Can you talk about what he learns from working with Dove?\n\nWill Forte: Yeah, I think that he starts out just thinking it's just this colorful fluff piece. [That's] what he's envisioning, and then when they start to figure things out, he is reluctant for some reason.\n\nBut I think that eventually, Dove starts to teach him that what he's doing affects other people in ways that he might not be aware of. And he learns from her a little bit. She learns from him a little bit. Everybody learns from everybody a little bit.\n\nSpeaking of learning from everyone, Robin, Emmy's young, fresh, and new at the game. What tips would you say she picks up over the season? Who does she start to emulate more and why?\n\nRobyn Cara: Yeah, so she's very fresh This is her first time out in the field, and she's looked up to Dove's investigative journalism career for so long now. I think Dove gives her a bit of daring that she might not have already had, and she encourages that in maybe not the best way possible. But it definitely brings that out of her, which ultimately is going to make her a better journalist... Maybe.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen: Yeah, it builds character. That's what. Unusual tactics, but builds character.\n\nBodkin May Not Be Real, But It's Great For Ireland & Podcasts\n\nThe setting in Ireland, which is just gorgeous, should immediately make people want to watch the series. But what did you like best about bringing the fictional town of Botkin to life?\n\nWill Forte: The easy one is just being there in that beautiful spot. Every location was just a delight to be in. I mean, we shot in Dublin and Wicklow for a while, and then we were down in a place called Union Hall in West Cork for a lot of it. It was stunning [shot] after stunning shot after stunning shot.\n\nIt was just a treat to spend that much time in these different, incredibly beautiful locations with these amazing people that you got to hang around with all the time.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n and Robin, if you had to start your own podcast series, what is one that you'd want to jump on?\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen: Podcasts that I listen to all the time are always personal story podcasts, like This American Life and Heavyweight. I love John Green's The Anthropocene Reviewed.\n\nSo, if I had to make a podcast, that's the route I would like to go down. Get people in studio with me and get them to open up about their dark secrets. That's what my vibe would be.\n\nRobyn Cara: My favorite podcast is Off Menu. I love Off Menu, which is just about your dream meal. It's basically about food, so mine would be about food.\n\nAbout Bodkin\n\nClose\n\nBodkin is a darkly comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in an idyllic, coastal Irish town.

Of course, there is some dark stuff hiding behind that sunny disposition.\n\nRathfarnham native Siobhan Cullen plays Dove, a hard-nosed investigative journalist who is currently living in London but originally from Dublin.\n\nShe has a fine-tuned bullshit detector and a healthy disdain for authority and hypocrisy. People find Dove rude and \"difficult\" -- and it's not helping matters that she's going through the biggest professional crisis of her career.\n\nRobyn Cara plays Emmy, a funny and eager-to-please researcher who has been helping Gilbert organise the podcast while struggling to find her own voice and masking her insecurities with enthusiasm and comedy.\n\nIntermission actor David Wilmot plays Seamus Gallagher, a mercurial and mysterious figure who can turn on the charm when it serves his needs, but can just as quickly snap into outbursts of violence when he feels he's being threatened.\n\nThe Young Offenders star Chris Walley plays Sean O'Shea, an Irish country lad who's feckless, up for a laugh, and not particularly preoccupied with the responsibilities that usually accompany adulthood. He's also wrapped up in some pretty shady business and completely out of his depth.\n\nBehind the camera\n\nBodkin is created and executive produced by Jez Scharf, who also serves as co-showrunner alongside fellow executive producer Alex Metcalf.\n\nThe series hails from Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground production company, and the former White House residents serve as executive producers alongside Tonia Davis, their head of film and television, as well as Nne Ebong, and David Flynn and Paul Lee for wiip.\n\nNash Edgerton is lead director.\n\nFilming locations\n\nMuch of the series was shot in West Cork, with Union Hall filling in for the fictional town of Bodkin.\n\nMetcalf loved filming Bodkin in Ireland and said that locals welcomed the cast and crew with open arms.\n\n\"The imaginary town of Bodkin is situated in West Cork, and it's a wild and fabulous landscape,\" he said. \"Union Hall really appealed to us as a location and so did its connection to the ocean.\n\n\"The fact that there's a working harbour there, and it's incredibly beautiful. The locals in Union Hall have been incredibly welcoming and helpful, and receptive to our work in the town.\"\n\nCullen, who plays Dove on the show, agreed. \"It's been really brilliant shooting at home in Ireland, especially shooting in West Cork,\" the actress said. \"It's, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful places in the world.\"\n\nForte raved about his time filming in Ireland, saying that \"every location was just a delight to be in\".\n\n\"I mean, we shot in Dublin and Wicklow for a while, and then we were down in a place called Union Hall in West Cork for a lot of it,\" he said. \"It was stunning [shot] after stunning shot after stunning shot.\n\n\"It was just a treat to spend that much time in these different, incredibly beautiful locations with these amazing people that you got to hang around with all the time. \"\n\nRelease date\n\nAll seven episodes of Bodkin land on Netflix this Thursday, May 9th.\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to get the latest news direct to your inbox\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The seven-parter is billed as \"a dark comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters\" (Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, Robyn Cara) who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in the village's Samhain festival some twenty years before.\n\nNaturally, the eccentric locals aren't exactly glad to see the true crime merchants, especially when the ill-matched trio begin to discover the truth about what really happened all those years ago.\n\nIf we were doing an elevator pitch, we might say Bodkin is The Valley of The Squinting Windows meets Twin Peaks meets The Wickerman. Or something.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama are among the executive producers and it boasts a strong cast, including the ubiquitous Cullen (Obituary, The Dry), Forte (MacGruber, Run and Jump), and Robyn Cara as our three very different podcasters.\n\nIt'd darkly quaint stuff. However, we can already feel Irish viewers' antennae twitching at any hint of sham-roguery or beggorah.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9 Entertainment, Siobh\u00e1n, who plays truth-seeking journalist called Dove in the series, says, \"I'll be honest - whenever I come across a script that feels inherently Irish but may not be written or created by an Irish team, your guard is up but I think that revealed my own prejudices. I'd nothing to worry about with Bodkin.\n\n\"In our writers' room, half of them were Irish themselves. We've a mostly Irish cast - bar Will and Robyn - our crew is all Irish and there was definitely an importance placed on making sure It was an authentic portrayal of Ireland and a real one so I had nothing to worry about to be honest. It feels quite genuine and real.\"\n\nDove is not only very misnamed but she is also deeply guarded and distrustful of the locals. She skulks around the picture postcard village in a leather trench coat and shades, looking like Carrie Annie Moss in The Matrix\n\nThe cast also features Young Offenders star Chris Walley as cheeky chappy Sean O'Shea, David Wilmot as the crusty and rather fierce Seamus, and Pat Shortt as a farmer with a \"melancholic bull\" and something to hide.\n\nCalifornian actor Forte is the SNL alumnus who has carved a respected comedic acting career, most notably in the excellent MacGyver skit MacGruber. He has already made two films in Ireland, including Run and Jump, and this time out, he even brought his wife along while he was making Bodkin.\n\nHe plays the charming and seemingly innocent Gilbert Power, a renowned podcaster who badly needs a hit after his career hits the skids. He sees a trip to Bodkin as a chance to discover his Irish roots and enjoy the Guinness.\n\nTo say the least, Gilbert is wearing shamrock-tinted glasses. \"When I am over in Ireland as myself, Will Forte, I am just as enthusiastic about Ireland as Gilbert is,\" he says.\n\n\"Everyone is used to American tourists coming over and being gaga over Ireland but everyone has been so nice and accommodating and I love Ireland so much and I've never had anything less than just a wonderful welcome.\"\n\nQuaintness gives way to darkness pretty quickly in Bodkin and by episode two, very strange and very nasty things begin happening.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says Siobh\u00e1n. \"That's one of the great things about the show. You're led down a different route than you think you've been going. It keeps you guessing, it keeps surprising you. It definitely keeps the audience on their toes and very quickly things descend into chaos.\"\n\nNo that the actual good people of Union Hall weren't welcoming.\n\n\"They were! In contrast to how the Bodkin locals are on the actual show, we don't get a warm welcome from them!\" laughs Robyn. \"The people in Union Hall were lovely. We kind of took over their town so I hope they like the show!\"\n\nIn fact, Will, Robyn and Siobh\u00e1n made the most of their time in West Cork and took regular day trips during breaks from filming, \"There were lots of adventures courtesy of Mr Forte,\" says Siobh\u00e1n.\n\n\"I love forcing people into my car and taking them places,\" says Will. \"We went to Mizen Head with Chris Walley and then I took him to Sheep's Head and made him hike around with me.\n\n\"I just forced road trips on people. David Wilmot was the only one who just would not bite. He was the only one who didn't want to explore with me.\"\n\nBodkin is on Netflix from this Thursday", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Which is why everyone gabbing on about Serial or The Jinx could only lead to Only Murders in the Building or Black Mirror's recent Loch Henry episode.\n\nBodkin, a new Netflix drama, finds itself very much in what I'll call the third wave of True Crime-ism, which is the one where we're allowed to say: \"Isn't this all a bit silly?\" Its set-up is very much Only Murders in the Building, so long as that Building is in West Cork: three unlikely podcasters head to the fictional Irish coastal town of Bodkin to investigate the disappearance of three strangers 25 years ago.\n\nNaturally, our starring trio are a mismatched crew. Gilbert (Will Forte) is a tiggerish American podcaster who thinks rural Ireland is all craic and slainte; Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen) is a Dublin-born investigative journalist currently working in London who thinks true-crime podcasting is barrel-scraping journalism; Emmy (Robyn Cara) is their wide-eyed researcher. Dove - reeling from a whistleblower case where her source hanged himself - is none too happy to be back in Ireland, and certainly not back there with a grinning American chancer.\n\nThese are not the most promising beginnings. At the start, Bodkin feels both over-familiar (fish-out-of-water, small town with secrets) as well as forced. The only reason, for example, that our team would conceivably not have hired a car to get around a place they don't know is so that they can meet local taxi driver Sean, who happens to be a key part of the plot.\n\nHowever, once our trio are in Bodkin and you forget about what brought them there (ie the requirements of television drama), the show really hits its straps. It has that sense of low-level anarchy, both in what it portrays - pagan rituals, mad locals, a community held together by trust and family more than law and order - and in the way it portrays it. Writer Jez Scharf throws everything at the wall with absurdist relish, including secret children, sensationally negligent policing, yoga nuns, server farms, Semtex and eels. Not all, but a good deal of it, sticks.\n\nIt helps, of course, that the West Cork setting would be watchable even as a screensaver, but the performances are the real glue. Cullen was superb in The Dry and deserves top billing in whatever she does next for her hard-nosed hack Dove. Forte, a Saturday Night Live alumni, starts out as a gleaming-toothed game-show host but by the end is a more interesting figure. Even the podcast-style voiceovers that are dotted throughout, laden with the kind of daft rhetorical questions podcasters use to fill space, ends up being both pleasingly parodical as well as a part of the story. Bodkin certainly isn't perfect, but its mayhem is infectious. There's no crime in that.\n\nBodkin is on Netflix from Thursday 9 May", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jinx_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Jinx (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Cork", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semtex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semtex"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8KKXFwHrTnBslNXkoQvD4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/18db468dac16f44b718f66e4f08f0ed0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2965, "textEnd": 2970}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The show features a talented cast including Siobh\u00e1n Cullen and Robyn Cara, with episodes directed by Bronwen Hughes. Will Forte shines as Gilbert in his first leading role since Sweet Tooth, delivering a blend of comedy and mystery in Bodkin. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe cast of Bodkin features a star performance from former Saturday Night Live cast member Will Forte.

Three of Bodkin's seven episodes are directed by Bronwen Hughes, who is best known for her directorial work on Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and 13 Reasons Why.\n\nBodkin follows Forte's happy-go-lucky protagonist Gilbert, a professional podcaster who travels to the small fictitious town of Bodkin, Ireland for a lighthearted piece on a traditional festival. Gilbert is accompanied by Emmy, his ambitious yet inexperienced assistant, and Dove, a no-nonsense investigative journalist who reports on crime, murder, and similarly gruesome topics. Upon arriving in Bodkin, Gilbert, Dove, and Emmy are accompanied by Sean O'Shea, a local townie who is hired to be their driver during their stay.

The series stars Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, and Robyn Cara and follows a motley crew of podcasters who arrive in a small Irish town to investigate the disappearance of three people.\n\nWhat begins as a routine investigation quickly becomes a bizarre and complex story in which the team tries to unravel fact from fiction. The show is described as \"a dark comedic thriller,\" and is set against the backdrop of the stunning location of the fictitious town of Bodkin, nestled within the very real West Cork, Ireland. Notably, location is a major factor within the series, contributing to the show's atmospheric tension and visual appeal.\n\nThe series contains seven episodes all of which will be released on May 9, 2024.\n\nYou can watch all episodes of Bodkin season 1 on Netflix. The series features seven episodes, starring Will Forte and Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, and follows a team of podcasters investigating a cold case in Ireland.\n\nFans of dark comedies and true crime podcasts will find much to enjoy in Bodkin season 1, which will merge these elements into a gripping narrative against the scenic backdrop of coastal Ireland.\n\nThe show stars Siobh\u00e1n Cullen as Dove, an investigative journalist whose initial disinterest is transformed as she uncovers a deep conspiracy. In an interview with Screen Rant, Cullen described her character's evolution: \"She's in a really bad place... And I think being forced back to Ireland... forces [her] to face all those demons.\"\n\nFurthermore, playing Gilbert, Will Forte shifts from seeing the podcast project as a \"colorful fluff piece\" to recognizing its deeper implications. In the same interview, Forte explains, \"Dove starts to teach him that what he's doing affects other people in ways that he might not be aware of.\" This interaction highlights the dynamic learning process among the characters.\n\nNewcomer Robyn Cara, portraying Emmy, learns under Dove's tutelage, adopting daring methods that are \"unusual tactics but builds character,\" as Cullen puts it. This mentorship illustrates the significant personal and professional growth that occurs within the team.\n\nThe show is described by Netflix as follows:\n\n\"In their attempt to uncover the truth about the people lost during the town's annual Samhain celebration -- a traditional Gaelic fall festival that celebrates the end of the harvest season and the longer, darker days to come -- our heroes realize Bodkin might be small, but it holds some very big secrets.\n\nAs they unravel the threads that have been woven back together through the years, it seems like what the podcasters are going to discover is \"a commentary on stories of violence.\"\n\nAs mentioned before, all the episodes will be available on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanya_tewari@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanya Tewari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/046dc-17151572694743-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Netflix's Bodkin is a dark, comedic thriller about a group of podcasters who travel to an Irish village to investigate a 25-year-old mystery.\n\nIf the description alone makes you want to watch the podcast Bodkin is based on, well, there's a catch: Bodkin is not a true story, nor is the titular village a real place. \"It's all fake people. The mystery itself, we worked very hard to find something that is in no way adjacent to a real true crime story,\" co-showrunner and executive producer Alex Metcalf told Netflix. \"The fictionality of it was very deliberate.\"\n\nWhile Bodkin (which stars Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, and Robyn Cara) may not be a true story, there's a reason why it feels like it could be.\n\nCreator Jez Scharf told Netflix that the idea for Bodkin came when he was thinking about the \"morality\" of true crime. \"They're often very tragic stories, but are parceled up into neat episodes with a good hook at the end,\" he said.\n\nBodkin, however, takes a less straightforward route to the genre. \"Actually, of all the true crime podcasts, the one that was most inspiring to us was S-Town,\" Scharf explained. \"That's one where you come in thinking it's going to be about a murder, but then the story just spins out in ways that you don't expect.\"\n\nWhile viewers will naturally be focused on the on-screen twists, Bodkin's behind-the-scenes team is a surprise in itself.

But the cumulative effect belies the fact that it's a series that does a bunch of little things well in a low-key way, rather than doing any one thing spectacularly well.\n\nIt's a satire without any big laughs, a puzzle without many shocking twists and a character study, but of a very muted sort. If you go in looking for big reactions to anything, you'll be disappointed. If you look for some minor insights into our instinctive love of voyeuristic storytelling, some smartly rendered Irish settings and a few terrific performances -- Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, in particular, needs to be in everything -- Bodkin makes for an easy seven-episode binge.\n\nMy appreciation for the show is understated and appropriately so, since Bodkin is a show about a group of storytellers who go looking for something flashy and commercial, only to find something sadder and more human instead. It's about making your peace when the truth falls short of expectations and learning that not everything has to be sweetened with narrative trickery and sensationalism.\n\nCullen plays Dove, an investigative journalist for The Guardian. Her latest story, which involved a whistleblower spilling secrets about the NHS, went horribly wrong, and she's now under investigation herself. To avoid distractions, Dove's editor sends her off to rural Ireland on a new assignment: She's to lend assistance on a new podcast that The Guardian is partnering on with a respected podcast auteur, Gilbert Power (Forte). Dove hates podcasts and doesn't especially respect what Gilbert does.\n\nGilbert is semi-famous, but he isn't necessarily good at his job. He had one hit podcast season, a fluke that upended his life, followed by several failures, but there's a story in tiny Bodkin that he thinks could rejuvenate his career. See, 25 years earlier, three people disappeared in the middle of the annual Samhain festival. Gilbert figures that the combination of an unsolved mystery, some quirky local color and possibly some personal elements as he reconnects with his Irish roots could be a smash. He, like Dove, is running away from something in his life.\n\nThe reportorial trio is rounded out by Emmy (Robyn Cara), an eager-beaver researcher who idolizes both Dove and Gilbert without fully understanding the gritty reality of their jobs.\n\nThey arrive in Bodkin and, after a brief appreciation of the town's quintessential quirkiness, they begin to get signals that the story Gilbert is prepared to tell isn't the real story.\n\nNearly every episode of Bodkin begins with Gilbert's voiceover, a set of general platitudes -- \"Folk tales are more than just stories. They're a warning.\" -- that will be familiar to regular podcast listeners. Gilbert has pre-told and pre-judged what happened in Bodkin in his mind, and he's trying to steer reality to match his preconception.\n\nViewers are undergoing a similar journey, because we think we recognize the sort of fish-out-of-water dark comedy that Bodkin wants to be. At least for an episode or two, the show gives us something that resembles that. In this respect, Forte is something of a Trojan horse. Nothing in the way that he's playing Gilbert is overtly comedic, but our familiarity with versions of Forte's man-child act suggests he's supposed to be. For a little while, Bodkin puts Gilbert at the center and layers in various eccentric supporting characters and running jokes, mostly gently chiding podcasts and the people who love them. But it isn't that story and it isn't his story.\n\nThe show sets viewers up for crescendos of humor and mystery, including a scattering of real-world details -- the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, hints tied to Ireland's Magdalene asylums. The actual peeling back of layers is generally less wild (though the one formally experimental episode playing with our three protagonists' perspectives is probably my favorite of the season), less amusing, less provocative and less thrilling, but perhaps more emotionally grounded.\n\nSeveral performances, starting with Cullen's, keep the show anchored. Whether or not you've seen the Irish actress in previous TV work -- Obituary is on Hulu, The Dry on BritBox -- she's immediately striking as both the funniest part of the early episodes and the rawest and most dramatic part of the show's progression. More than any other character in the series, she has an appreciable arc. Whether she's using the scripts' myriad obscenities as a weapon or more quietly delving into Dove's traumatic past, Cullen makes underwritten beats feel earned. Both Cullen and Cara get to play a wider range than Forte, who stays pointedly and effectively sincere throughout, naive without being cartoonishly so.\n\nThe series, which features Nash Edgerton and Bronwen Hughes among its primary directors, generally feels right thanks to its beautifully photographed West Cork locations and a deep supporting cast, topped by David Wilmot as a local with a disproportionate number of secrets and Fionnula Flanagan as a nun with a disproportionate number of secrets. Yes, everybody in Bodkin has a disproportionate number of secrets, but it's fairly easy to keep them straight.\n\nBodkin holds your hand in unfolding its mystery, but not in spelling out its message, which I appreciated. Those opening voiceovers from Gilbert lampoon the way podcasts can sometimes try to reassure fans that there are easy lessons to draw from the recounting and enjoyment of tragic stories. Sometimes there are and sometimes there aren't!\n\nIn Bodkin, the answers are muddier for the storyteller and the listener alike, and for each character, since nobody here is a clear hero or a clear villain.

But for the people of Bodkin, Ireland -- the titular, fictional shoreside town in Netflix's new mystery series Bodkin, premiering May 9 -- the true-crime podcast wave hasn't even begun to crest. That's why, when popular podcast host Gilbert Power (Will Forte), his researcher Emmy (Robyn Cara), and crotchety investigative reporter for The Guardian Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen) step foot in Bodkin, they're welcomed with wide-eyed fascination.\n\nThat is, until the trio starts poking around, looking to cover a decades-old cold case that still haunts the town and its colorful characters. When local threads are pulled, their once-knotted history unspools, revealing dark and absurd secrets. Bodkin takes pleasure in stringing viewers along, winding itself past red herrings and red-haired residents who all have something to hide. While the series sometimes mirrors the pace of Bodkin's small-town life too literally, drifting aimlessly to fill time, its enthusiastic cast -- led by the terrifically cast Forte and Cullen -- keep Bodkin stimulating enough to be more than just a knockoff Only Murders in the Building. Instead, it skewers the macabre voyeurism of true-crime podcasting, implicating its viewers just as much as its characters, to surprisingly refreshing results.\n\nAfter three seasons of Only Murders, last year's Based on a True Story, 2019's Truth be Told, and a quietly vicious Portlandia sketch, television seems to have reached its limit for shows about making true-crime podcasts. You'd be forgiven for wanting to avoid Bodkin entirely based on its stale premise alone. (You can practically hear the pitch meeting at Netflix now: \"Three people investigate a crime to make a podcast -- this time, in Ireland!\"). But the show, at the very least, anticipates its audience's exhaustion -- something other shows don't typically contend with.\n\nWhen Siobhan's key informant in an investigation is killed, she gets a call from her editor at The Guardian, telling her to move the case to the backburner for her safety. Instead, he's shipping her off to Ireland with Gilbert and Emmy to work on their upcoming podcast, an order that makes the Irish native recoil. \"True crime podcasts aren't journalism. They're necrophilia, \" Siobhan says over the phone. Immediately, Bodkin proves itself more critical of the industry it's detailing than something like Only Murders, which has only glorified the sometimes rapacious nature of amateur podcasting -- albeit to a beloved response from viewers.\n\nBodkin has guts; there's no doubt about that. Gilbert isn't afraid to admit that the true-crime podcast fad often delivers depreciating results, remarking to Siobhan that the last two seasons of his hit show disappointed his audiences. That's why he's so intent on his next effort being a total knockout. Bodkin is the perfect setting for his show: a sleepy hamlet that's still packed to the brim with covert deception, even after a mystery from 25 years earlier put it on the map.\n\nThe disappearance of multiple townspeople on Samhain -- a Gaelic festival similar to Pagan Halloween traditions -- rocked Bodkin, especially since their bodies were never found. In Ireland, myths and legends weave into local history and lore as much as actual events. Siobhan, Gilbert, and Emmy soon wonder how much of what they uncover about the Samhain disappearances is true and how much of it is a story, passed down so often over the years that it practically became reality.\n\nBodkin's most fascinating element is its central question of what is and is not fact, and the show finds plenty of unique ways to ask it across seven episodes. Leads that seem promising quickly dissolve when they're poked too hard, and characters like the burly and dangerous Seamus Gallagher (David Wilmot) and the soft-spoken but secretive driver S\u00e9an O'Shea (Chris Walley) are never quite who they seem to be. That enigmatic element keeps the show consistently interesting, even if it can be frustrating to be led down a path that goes nowhere. These miniature dead ends mimic the rhythm of a true-crime podcast; episodes begin and end with Gilbert's narration, swaying viewers to keep at it even when Bodkin runs itself in circles. The resulting dizziness might be a bit much for some, but others will find joy in these lightheaded thrills.\n\nThe show necessitates some clever writing, given that its style is severely lacking. Bodkin makes little effort to craft any sort of singular visual cohesion. Its coloring is dreary, with lush, green Irish landscapes muted into grays and blues that might reflect the show's gloomy mystery, but don't draw the eye for more than a few moments. When Gilbert comments on how verdant the foliage is in Bodkin, it almost comes off like a joke, given that what green there is has been toned down so much in post-production -- seemingly to keep the show's characters as its central focus. After Ripley reminded the world that mysteries can be as stimulating to the eye as to the brain, it's hard to root for such a style-deficient puzzler when we know what we could have.\n\nLuckily, Bodkin's characters carry the brunt of the show on their back. The series is a genuine two-hander; when Siobhan and Gilbert investigate together, Forte and Cullen's chemistry and their mutual commitment to fleshing out their characters' neuroses helps the show jump off the screen in ways its subdued style otherwise wouldn't allow. While Forte is wonderful in one of his rare dramatic roles, Cullen is Bodkin's major scene-stealer. An Irish television star in her own right, Cullen continues her breakout year stateside after her delightful star turn in the Irish black comedy Obituary, which recently started streaming on Hulu. In Bodkin, Cullen runs away with her hard-nosed, traditional journalist character, making Siobhan real and nuanced, with scruples she won't drop, even if she does lighten up when she realizes there is a major case to pursue. Siobhan could easily be a parody of a person, some conventional reporter who rebukes the more modern \"version\" of her profession. But the show's writers refuse to make it that simple (and frankly, incorrect), insisting that true investigative skills can't be learned just by putting mouth to mic.\n\nBy rebuffing the notion that true-crime podcasting is a viable way to solve a mystery, Bodkin finds an unusual approach to its played-out concept. Here is a show that is willing to take itself to task and bring viewers along while it works out the answer to its central question. Is Siobhan correct? Is this a predatory art form disguised as entertainment? And where is the line drawn in the search for the truth amidst murky surreality? The series may stumble while it seeks answers, but the fact that it's willing to pose these questions at all indicates that the tide may be turning, tempering that true-crime podcast wave. Like the media genre it parodies, Bodkin understands that being ahead of the curve doesn't really matter, as long as there is something interesting to say by the series' end.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portlandia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macabre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macabre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red herring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voyeurism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Walley_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Walley (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Ripley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Ripley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715203881/230508-bodkin-tease_mpafx6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 376}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It shares the protracted rhythms of typical true crime in that it's brimming with detail while stashing its most salacious revelations for the end of each episode, almost as if it's daring its audience not to hit play on the next one. Episodes are inundated with tin-eared true-crime clich\u00e9s, but it's done winkingly by Will Forte, who drops lines like \"the more you learn, the less you know\" and other such inanities. Its score, by Paul Leonard-Morgan, evokes the plinky earworm themes from investigative podcasts like Serial, a creative choice that seems almost Pavlovian in its design. Bodkin knows what it is, and thanks to this self-cognizance, it becomes more.\n\nYet, as good as Bodkin is, no amount of quality character work or engrossing mystery can kick enough dirt over how dumb it is to hear the word \"podcast\" repeated again and again. That might explain one of the show's better recurring jokes: Gilbert (Forte), a Chicago-based podcaster eager to both please and impress, frequently tells folks from the provincial Irish village which gives the show its title that he's doing a podcast. The retort we often hear, delivered in that politely barbed manner the Irish tend to excel at, is priceless: \"And will people listen to it?\"\n\nThe humor in Bodkin is, to put it mildly, droll. It sets a mood as much as the dramatic elements of Scharf's story, and that blend of wit and melancholy mostly clicks. It makes much of the events that transpire in this fictional town feel both conceivable and ridiculous at the same time, even if those barbs are eventually sanded down by kindness and virtue before the end -- an inevitability, perhaps, considering Bodkin is produced by Higher Ground executives Barack and Michelle Obama. Still, the series' off-kilter approach is successful, by and large, and puts steam behind the many intrigues that uncoil during its seven-hour runtime.\n\nThis brings us to the case that delivers Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), Gilbert, and Emmy (Robyn Cara) to the seaside town of Bodkin. Twenty-five years ago, three people went missing during the local Samhain festival -- that's the Gaelic festival to honor the dead, pronounced \"sow-in\" -- which dresses up the story with a bit of the macabre. (\"It's a great lens for the podcast,\" Gilbert tells his partners.) Looking at it dramatically, Samhain also speaks to the pressure valve in Bodkin that's just begging to be opened and the elusive mystery aspects that so often dress up the tragedies exploited in true crime. Scharf initially uses the Samhain angle to distract from what's really going on in this town, a clever sleight of hand that eventually gives way to a darker, sadder story about generational pain and the community that collectively bears its burdens.\n\nOn the eve of this grim anniversary, Gilbert, whose genial Midwesterness makes him a target of much scorn from Bodkin's citizenry -- to say nothing of Dove, who is like Lois Lane if she subsisted only on whiskey and didn't believe in heroes -- is sent by The Guardian to put together his story. It's important to note who's paying Gilbert and why because it reveals what Scharf thinks about the state of modern journalism and how it embraces sensationalized gimmicks as a financial crutch. (He also wisely uses this story beat to create strife between Dove and Gilbert early on.) Paired with Emmy, a researcher whose city-mouse naivete will soon be put to the test (as it must), Gilbert's pursuit of the story dredges up skeletons he'd prefer were kept stashed away until his new hit podcast is in the can. Maybe even after that.\n\nScharf's conceit is to criticize those indefatigable armchair journalists who exploit the true-crime fad to ill-considered ends, but that's just the groundwork for his loftier dramatic ambitions. He also takes a good-natured jab at the viewer, who will doubtlessly have listened to enough of these podcasts to know when they're being bullshitted, and it's here where Bodkin's fictionalized take on podcasting hackery gets a little absurd. Surreal contrivances such as a criminal ring operating in Bodkin, a strange wolf that periodically wanders into Dove's view, and nuns serving questionable tea all pay off in surprisingly affecting ways, given how silly a lot of it is.\n\nSo what's happening in Bodkin, and who's responsible for much of this town's ills? Is it the sodden police captain (Denis Conway) who menaces Gilbert and Emmy? Maybe it's Teddy (Ger Kelly), the sulky but gentle blacksmith who was among the missing and holds onto profound depths of ache from this childhood trauma? What about the McArdles, the violent clan whose sordid criminal history looms over Bodkin like a whiskey-reeking overcoat? And don't forget about that nun with the tea (Fionnula Flanagan), who has history with Dove that will need sorting before the Bodkin story can be filed with Dove's put-upon editor (Charlie Kemp). It's a right proper cast of red herrings Bodkin has assembled, all colorful in their own wonderful ways.\n\nBut an emphasis of praise must be put on David Wilmot as the shifty-eyed Seamus Gallagher, a local man with a musical soul and a penchant for sudden bursts of violence. Seamus is the source of much drama in Bodkin, and after a few hours spent with him, it's clear he's also its thundering heart. Seamus is a terrific character: He engages in an impromptu slow dance with Gilbert (to \"Time After Time\" by Cyndi Lauper) and, in one riotous sequence, helps his new podcaster buddy navigate a bit of local trouble using nothing but a staple gun. Throughout his various misadventures, Wilmot balances his character's innate sadness with a register of danger. Whenever he's around, especially during scenes with Forte, Bodkin flirts with greatness.\n\nOf course, plot is just as essential as character in a story like Bodkin, and its podcaster mystery tour isn't as intriguing or fun once the time comes to pull its loose threads into an appropriately messy climax. Yet as cluttered as Scharf's ending is, it's ambitious, and even when he's eagerly underscoring his points about storytellers and their personal reasons for pursuing stories, they resonate because they feel true. Broadly speaking, the true-crime podcast is frustrating to engage with because any conclusion it reaches, when it bothers reaching for one, is hardly cathartic or even satisfying.

The writing and directing teams are made up of British, American, Irish and Australian talent. The series is produced by the Obamas' company Higher Ground, making its first foray into scripted television.\n\nWe know from bitter experience what the result can be when Netflix rubs up against rural Ireland: dross like Irish Wish. At first sight, Bodkin looks like it might be about to plummet into the same dark pit of paddywhackery.\n\nIt's set in a West Cork coastal town with a funny-sounding name. The inhabitants come across as the usual collection of colourful, folksy eccentrics and oddballs.\n\nBodkin Netflix Official Trailer\n\nIf this isn't enough to set your Oirish bullshit-detecting antennae twitching, then the fact that the animated opening titles feature a pint of Guinness, a nun and a St Brigid's Cross should be.\n\nDon't run away, because Bodkin is not what you might have feared. It's clever, funny and properly gripping stuff\n\nBut wait -- don't run away, because Bodkin is not what you might have feared. It's clever, funny and properly gripping stuff: a deliciously offbeat concoction of the (intentionally) silly and the sinister that delights in setting up more shamrock-laden clich\u00e9s than you can shake a shillelagh at and then gleefully shredding them.\n\nForget Ballykissangel. If the town of Bodkin were to be twinned with anywhere, the obvious contender would be Royston Vasey from The League of Gentlemen.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, three strangers went missing at the same time during the Samhain festival. With this year's event about to get underway, a motley team of true-crime podcasters descend on the town, determined to get to the bottom of the mystery.\n\nWell, one of them is determined to, anyway. This is Chicago native Gilbert, played by Saturday Night Live alumnus and Nebraska star Will Forte.\n\nGilbert is regarded as something of a podcasting legend. The reality, however, is rather sadder. His reputation rests on one podcast from a few years ago, which was a huge success, but has had a deep and lasting negative impact on his marriage.\n\nIn an effort to repeat his early triumph, he's got himself into serious debt. He desperately needs his Bodkin podcast to be a hit.\n\nGilbert is accompanied by his naive British researcher Emmy (Robyn Cara), who looks up to him as a hero. The third member of the team, and a reluctant one, is Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen from Obituary and The Dry -- a series which shares several cast members with Bodkin).\n\nDove is a Dublin-born investigative journalist with The Guardian in London, which has a stake in Gilbert's podcast. Her most recent story, involving a government whistleblower, turned into a disaster when the whistleblower's name was leaked, leading him to hang himself.\n\nHer editor has packed her off to Bodkin to keep her out of the way -- and possibly out of jail for breaching the Official Secrets Act.\n\nIt's safe to say it's the last place Dove, who couldn't be any more spiky if she wore a coat made from hedgehog pelts, wants to be.\n\n\"True-crime podcasting isn't journalism, it's necrophilia,\" she says.\n\nShe resents being stuck with a chirpy, wide-eyed Yank like gullible Gilbert, who \"thinks rural Ireland is Disneyland\" and believes any old tourist-trapping guff the locals pitch him.\n\nGradually, however, this unlikely trio coalesce as they begin to suspect dark deeds are afoot in Bodkin. There are hints of folk horror and the supernatural (Dove is being stalked by a wolf nobody else appears to see), as well some wonderfully quirky humour, such as the three oulfellas arguing the merits of The Rolling Stones versus Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThe splendid Irish cast includes David Wilmot as the shady Seamus, who may or may not be a former terrorist gunrunner known as \"The Badger\", The Young Offenders' Chris Walley as the trio's dodgy driver Se\u00e1n, who claims he was adopted from a Romanian orphanage, and Fionnula Flanagan as the leader of a desanctified order of nuns who run yoga classes at their island retreat.\n\nI'm not a natural binge-watcher, but I greedily ate my way through the first four episodes in one sitting and loved it. I suspect Netflix has a winner on its hands with this one.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The filming locations of new Netflix thriller", "body": "Bodkin is the latest Netflix TV series to excite viewers, but many want to know where the dark comedy thriller series is filmed.\n\nNetflix has made a splash in 2024 as they have already released several homegrown TV series that have delighted and excited fans.\n\nFrom One Day to Beckham, to Baby Reindeer, the platform has released several shows ranging from romantic comedies to gritty and trauma-filled series.\n\nTaking a stab at an Only Murders in the Building-style show, Bodkin is Netflix's latest offering to fans launched on May 9.\n\nThe series focuses on podcasters in Ireland attempting to solve a cold case from many years ago.\n\nWhile it may sound sinister, the series is a dark comedy filled with humour, witty one-liners, and hilarious characters that add colour and fun to this thriller.\n\nIn the trailer, the characters state that they are in the 'a*** end of nowhere', but fans want to know if the coastal town is a real place, or simply imagined for the series.\n\nStarring Will Forte as an American podcaster and Siobh\u00e1n Cullen as the reluctant investigative journalist from Dublin he teams up with, the TV series follows a group of podcasters investigating mysterious disappearances that occurred over two decades ago in a charming town in Ireland.\n\nForte stars as Gilbert Power, who decides to move into the true-crime genre after having a previous hit when he documented his wife's cancer.\n\nTo explore his Irish heritage, he chooses to investigate the disappearance of three people from Bodkin in Cork, Ireland during the annual Samhain festival.\n\nDespite a frosty initial reception from the locals in the area, the characters settle in and begin to uncover the truth in this show filled with black humour.\n\nBodkin is not a real place in Ireland, but filming took place predominantly in West Cork in the summer of 2022, where Bodkin is supposed to be located.\n\nThe majority of 'Bodkin' was filmed in Union Hall, a fishing village located on the west side of Glandore Harbour. As of 2016, a census showed the village was home to just 260 inhabitants.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen, who plays a journalist named Dove in the show told Express: 'Union Hall makes the perfect Bodkin.\n\n'It's so stunning and it encapsulates all of what people imagine about the beauty of Ireland. It's all here, it's such a stunning place.'\n\nKey locations in Cork include Poulgorm Bridge and Glandore.\n\nOther filming locations were in Wicklow and Dublin, and filming took place over six months. Eagle-eyed viewers may also spot scenes shot at Travelhawk Beach in Wicklow and Howth Castle and Leopardstown Racecourse in Dublin.\n\nThe creators of the show have expressed that the series is entirely fictional. 'Not a real story, not a real place,' said executive producer Alex Metcalf to Tudum.\n\nSeries creator Jez Scharf added: 'It's a fake town, it's a fake place. It's all fake people.\n\n'The mystery itself, we worked very hard to find something that is in no way adjacent to a real true crime story. The fictionality of it was very deliberate.'\n\nBodkin was released on Netflix on May 9 and is available to stream now.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the

If Only It Gave Her a Real TV Show\n\nIn Netflix's new series Bodkin, hard-bitten newspaper reporter Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen) is forced to team up with veteran podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) to investigate a 25-year-old mystery in the eponymous Irish town. The reluctant partners clash on everything, not least of which is that Dove thinks they can, and should, find out what really happened in Bodkin back in the day.\n\n\"Have you ever listened to a podcast where they actually solve it?\" Gilbert asks, incredulous. \"I need diversions. Red herrings. Human interest. The stuff that people actually care about.\"\n\nGilbert isn't wrong that true crime podcasts (and true crime books and documentaries, for that matter) almost never close the case independent of law-enforcement. But his belief that the audience only tangentially cares about the mystery itself is one seemingly shared by Bodkin itself. The show is vaguely interested in why three people disappeared on the same night the town was hosting its annual Samhain festival. Mostly, though, it cares about Dove, Gilbert, their researcher Emmy (Robyn Cara), and the people of Bodkin, as well as the alternately quirky and menacing atmosphere of this little village in West Cork. One interview subject wonders if this is going to be \"a podcast that pretends to be about one thing, but is really about something else,\" and their suspicion is more or less proven correct.\n\nPodcasting is a professional arena that movies and television have had a mixed track record of fictionalizing in recent years. Only Murders in the Building works because it's an explicit parody of true crime podcasts, and because it's clear throughout that the podcast is meant to be terrible. (This is, by and large, a safer approach than insisting your show-within-the-show is a masterpiece -- which is why audiences are still happily streaming 30 Rock, whose fake SNL was supposed to be bad, while Aaron Sorkin's painfully sincere Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was an infamous flop.) Often, though, stories about fictional podcasters feel like they're made by people who recognize that the medium is popular, but don't quite understand why.\n\nI spent most of the seven episodes of Bodkin wondering whether Scharf thought Gilbert was good at his job or a buffoon who deserved the contempt of the cynical Dove. Much of the evidence pointed to the latter theory. He's played by Will Forte, whose specialty is playing overconfident clowns, and whose performance at times seems to point in a MacGruber direction. Gilbert's podcast narration, which bookends each episode of the TV show, is melodramatic and riddled with cliches, like the time he explains, \"The problem with questions is the answers. Sometimes, the more you learn, the less you know.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Forte gets to dial back the silliest aspects of his performance over time, as we discover that Gilbert's real life is a lot more fragile and complicated than the persona he projects when he's in front of a microphone. And the other characters at times speak just like him -- \"There are some questions that aren't made to be answered,\" one suspect tells law-enforcement in a later episode -- in a way suggesting that creator Jez Scharf and company(*) think this is perfectly fine dialogue.\n\n(*) Bodkin is the first scripted series from Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, after their deal with Netflix has previously led to documentaries and the Julia Roberts/Mahershala Ali/Ethan Hawke film Leave the World Behind.\n\nBodkin isn't quite as confused as it seems on the question of how seriously we should take Gilbert and his podcast. Still, the series is a tricky balance of tones and ideas that works at some times, but not at others. And its own interest in the mystery of what happened that night of the Samhain festival comes and goes. But many of the performers do interesting and appealing work -- even Forte's quite good when the show allows Gilbert to be a person rather than a caricature -- and the town itself feels fully realized in a manner that lives up to Gilbert's belief that true crime audiences care more about people and places than they care about whodunnit.\n\nBodkin is a strange place, caught between old traditions (everyone keeps talking about the ways that Samhain inspired the most famous rituals of Halloween) and the modern world (a wealthy Bodkin native has returned from Silicon Valley to build an enormous server farm on the town's outskirts). There are complicated, interconnected backstories between the various witnesses and suspects, with David Wilmot from Station Eleven particularly strong as Seamus Gallagher, who's seemingly at the center of every subplot. Almost every time a character or place in town is on the verge of becoming too self-consciously twee -- the local convent has a yoga studio, and two nuns in the kitchen who trained under Jamie Oliver -- the show finds a way to reveal some specific, extremely human detail about them. And the character arcs for the three investigators, and the way that Gilbert's polish, Dove's relentlessness, and Emmy's optimism each rubs off on the other two, can be very endearing, especially towards the end.\n\nBut the show understandably has to keep returning to the mystery, which feels overly complicated even for seven hours of television. Perhaps this is itself a tribute to the kind of true crime podcast Gilbert has come to specialize in, where those red herrings have to do a lot of the work. If so, it would at least solve the mystery of whether Bodkin has affection for podcasting, or is gently mocking the form.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling

A new disturbing series with an Irish twist is coming to Netflix.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Bodkin on the west coast of Ireland, Netflix's new comedy-thriller stars Siobh\u00e1n Cullen as Dove, an investigative journalist from Dublin who gets involved with Gilbert Power (played by Will Forte), an American podcaster looking to discover his Irish roots and his young assistant Emmy (played by Robyn Cara).\n\nThree strangers vanish in Bodkin on Irish Night of the Dead\n\nThrough old newspaper reports, the trio find out about the mysterious disappearance of three strangers during the Gaelic festival Samhain (Night of the Dead) 21 years previously and begin to investigate deeper. They hope to unearth enough content and find out more about those unexplained events to produce a true-crime podcast (\"You're making a podcast? In Bodkin?\" one local asks them in surprise. \"And people will listen to it?\").\n\nThe deeper they delve, and the more they uncover, a dark, sinister narrative begins to slowly evolve. Their persistent questions and probing doesn't go well will everyone in Bodkin's tight-knit community, who are afraid that skeletons will be let out of the closet. \"Questions are what get people into trouble,\" one local warns. \"This is a quiet town with good people,\" another spits, \"Let the past go\".\n\nIt's a gripping, seven-episode series set in a stunning backdrop - lush green, rolling hills, lakes and forests. Each episode was filmed entirely on site at various locations in Ireland, among them, West Cork, Wicklow and Dublin.\n\nAs Bodkin's storyline unravels, and hidden secrets come to light, the three characters discover things about each other and themselves. The series, which gets darker and weirder with each episode, sets out to challenge perceptions about truth and reveals the tales we subconsciously tell ourselves to justify our thoughts and beliefs.\n\nBodkin will make its Netflix debut on Thursday 9 May, with all seven episodes being released simultaneously so subscribers can watch the whole lot in one sitting if they fancy.

In \"Hamlet,\" a \"bodkin\" is a dagger. A \"bare bodkin\" is one that is unsheathed.\n\n\"When he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?\" asks Shakespeare's Hamlet in his famed \"To be or not to be\" soliloquy as he contemplates bringing about his own death -- \"quietus\" -- with an unsheathed bodkin.\n\nThe connection, if any, between \"Bodkin\" and Shakespeare is not made in Episode One of the seven-episode \"Bodkin\" that the TV Blog previewed on Tuesday. No one quotes Shakespeare or mentions him or \"Hamlet\" at any time.\n\nThus, the connection, if any, between the village of Bodkin and \"Hamlet\" remains a mystery, which might be the point. Bodkin is a mysterious little place.\n\nThe set-up of the show is that this earnest podcast personality from America -- Gilbert Power, played by Will Forte (above photo) -- has come to the U.K. to produce a podcast on this cold case.\n\nThe podcast, which goes unnamed in Episode One (unless I missed it), is positioned as hugely successful, including having won a Peabody Award.\n\nThe scenario is that Britain's The Guardian newspaper has partnered with the podcaster for true-crime content, and an editor has assigned a hard-charging, cynical investigative reporter named Dove (Siohban Cullen, photo center) to assist Gilbert.\n\nThe assignment is a punishment of sorts for an unidentified story that went seriously awry for The Guardian and Dove, and the editor needs to send his reporter away to the boonies until the heat dies down.\n\nAlso in the mix is a na\u00efve, rookie investigative assistant from The Guardian, Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara, photo right).\n\nDove thinks the whole thing is beneath her, especially and including acting as a helpmate to this podcaster whose investigative methods escape her.\n\nI asked Google whether podcasts win Peabodys, and Google said yes. Last May, 2023 Peabody awards went to podcasts from public radio's \"In the Media\" and \"This American Life,\" plus \"Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's\" from Gimlet Media.\n\nAn estimated 23,000 true-crime podcasts are available now. On Audible's list of its most popular true-crime podcasts you will find \"True Crime All the Time,\" \"Crime Junkie,\" \"Morbid,\" and podcasts spun off from TV shows -- \"Dateline NBC,\" \"48 Hours\" and \"Snapped: Women Who Murder.\"\n\nWhile \"Bodkin\" is most assuredly a drama, the show takes a satiric approach to its characterization of the podcaster Gilbert Power.\n\nHe is portrayed as a cockeyed murder tourist who thinks he has stepped into a travel poster version of Ireland.\n\nHis conception of Ireland is diametrically opposed to Dove's. She is native Irish and left the country many years ago with no apparent intention of returning.\n\nLike so many other TV shows and movies today, the \"Bodkin\" credits list executive producers too numerous to count.\n\nTwo stand out, however -- none other than Barack and Michelle Obama, whose production company, Higher Ground Productions, is one of the show's producing partners.", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MediaPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_buckman@mediapost.com", "name": "Adam Buckman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peabody Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliloquy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soliloquy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audible (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_Productions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher Ground Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimlet_Media", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gimlet Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2024/05/07/bodkin-netflix-600_80Vj0rP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-31", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 360}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The series presents itself as a gritty but gripping thriller that simultaneously packs plenty of chuckles for true crime lovers and haters alike.

You can opt out anytime.\n\nSee all of our newsletters\n\nRather than innovative or interesting, Bodkin is deathly dull and dour. The show starts with intrepid reporter Dove Maloney (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen) discovering that the key source in a major, institution-shattering story she's been working on has killed himself. The who, what, where, and why of it all is kept vague until the end of the series, but all that matters is that somewhere along the way, Dove committed a journalistic faux pas and is under investigation by the UK government. So, in an effort to keep things calm and quiet, her editor sends her off to Bodkin, Ireland, where their outlet is working with renowned podcaster Gilbert Power (Will Forte) to produce a new true-crime hit about the town. Some years ago, on the night of Bodkin's Samhain festival, three people went missing, and though one turned up a few days later, the other two were never seen again. As Dove, Gilbert, and research assistant Emmy (Robyn Cara) dig deeper into the mystery, they discover several deeper conspiracies that implicate some of the community's pillars.\n\nThis plodding plot makes for a story that falls apart under any sort of scrutiny, with the show's twists and supposed surprises only serving to make things more complicated. Gilbert's occasional references to how stories need a red herring don't work to support just how many fish Bodkin reels in. What mystery the podcasting crew is trying to solve and create a narrative for changes minute by minute, and while that is a bit by design (Dove spends the series determined to turn this story into an actual journalistic endeavor, since she calls true crime \"necrophilia\"), it makes the show messy. Almost every new development feels contrived, from Bodkin's secret smuggling ring to the true identity of those who went missing. It's the kind of series where plenty could conceivably be considered a spoiler, but so little actually registers as relevant that it's hard to explain even the story's most important plot points.\n\nFurther weighing down the show are its gloomy and excessively serious characters. Dove is downright mean until a serendipitous heel turn in the final episode, and her severity is tough to watch at times. She's a fairly cruel character, but her intensity is largely one note, her harshness far from compelling. The comparably peppy Gilbert seems like a thankfully light-hearted foil for her, but it's not long before money troubles and a rocky marriage make him just as dreary. When his wife comes to Ireland just to serve him divorce papers, there's a good chance you'll groan louder than Gilbert.\n\nThis serious streak really dampens any of the series' attempts at comedy, which are unfortunately few and far between. The premise and the presence of SNL alum Forte may make you think that Bodkin is an Emerald Isle edition of Only Murders in the Building, but it lacks all of that show's wit and warmth. The first few episodes have some funny observations that play on the recent romanticization of all things Irish, but it's not a point of view that the series really sees through. Bodkin's Ireland is full of unnecessary inversions, with new age nuns, crude hippies, and Troubles-era gangsters working in small town shops -- it's like the people behind the series thought that such contrast alone was cutting commentary.\n\nThat is all to say that Bodkin is a major misfire, and it's certainly not worth your time. Though it purports to be a smart take on true crime, the series doesn't inspire much confidence or conversation.\n\nAll seven episodes of Bodkin are streaming now on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "observer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_babiak@observer.com", "name": "Laura Babiak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tagline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Necrophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red herring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spoiler (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Age"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/BODKIN_102_Unit_07331RC.jpg?quality=80&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

This untouched beauty is set to captivate a global audience as the new dark comedy thriller Bodkin debuts on Netflix this week.\n\nWith actors Siobh\u00e1n Cullen and Will Forte in the lead, much of the cast comprises local actors, including The Young Offenders star Chris Walley, who plays Sean, a young man with plenty of secrets to hide.\n\nSean isn't the only one with secrets; everyone from the local garda to an entrepreneur has a skeleton or two, which is what leads a group of podcasters to the town of Bodkin in the hope of solving the mysterious disappearance of some locals more than 20 years ago.\n\nUnion Hall is the location for the fictionalised Bodkin, and Cullen, who plays a hard-as-nails journalist, Dove, says locals were so welcoming when the Bodkin crew came to town.\n\n\"We took over Union Hall. They were so kind and welcoming,\" said Cullen. \"I'm sure it was slightly inconvenient when we'd have to ask people to stop driving down a road because we were shooting a scene, but they were all so good about it.\n\nIt was such a treat to get to shoot down there. It is so stunning. It felt like we were on our holidays. It was magical.\n\nU.S actor Will Forte is a regular on Irish shores - Bodkin is his third Irish production. In 2013, he appeared in the Irish-based Run & Jump, and in 2019, he starred in the paranormal comedy Extra Ordinary with Cobh comedian and writer Maeve Higgins.\n\n\"While we were shooting in Union Hall, we stayed in Glandore,\" said Forte, \"We did a little filming in Dublin, and at the end of the day, everyone went home and did their thing, but in Union Hall and Glandore, everyone was away from home, staying in the same vicinity and meeting up for dinner. It was a really wonderful experience.\"\n\nThe duo are in sync as they reminisce about the many West Cork dining spots where they spent time with the cast and crew, notably The Dock Wall in Union Hall and Haye's Bar in Glandore.\n\nForte plays Gilbert, an American who had a hit podcast and hopes to strike it lucky again with this latest true crime venture.\n\nThe more he investigates the missing people in West Cork, the stranger and more dangerous things get for him, yet Gilbert remains eternally optimistic. Forte says this optimism was part of the draw.\n\nThere were a million draws to do this. One was that the scripts were so fun and well written; I really enjoyed the character and felt connected to him.\n\n\"In my real life, I'm overly optimistic, so I felt hooked into that.\n\n\"I got to come to Ireland again. I've worked here three times now, and it was the millionth time I had come over to bum around Ireland on holiday. Everything was screaming, go do this.\"\n\nCullen, who recently won an IFTA Rising Star Award, was drawn in by the chance to play a layered character. Dove is a tricky person, but there is more to her than her prickly outward approach to life.\n\n\"On the page, especially in the first few episodes, she's not the most likeable or warm character, but you get a greater understanding of her as the series goes on, and you get an insight into why she is the way she is,\" said Cullen.\n\n\"It is fun to play a person who has layers. I hope [audiences] begin to empathise with her.\"\n\nThe show, which is executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama through their production company, Higher Ground, isn't afraid to go to dark places, but it is always through a comedic lens.\n\nBy intention or happenstance, Cullen is becoming the Irish queen of dark comedy, having starred in both The Dry and playing the lead in the hit RT\u00c9 dark comedy Obituary.\n\nWhat is about the Irish knack for making things dark and twisted, yet very funny? Cullen thinks it comes naturally.\n\n\"I think the Irish do particularly well with dark humour. Irish writers have a natural tendency towards the genre, and Irish performers just get it. It is a universal thing, but there's something specific about the Irish delivery of dark humour.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Forte, a long-time comedy actor, says he was excited to try the dark comedy genre.\n\n\"I love watching dark comedies and it was really fun to be a part of this because it didn't seem so far away from what I had done before, but it was also this new thing that I was getting to try out.\"\n\nBodkin is set in the days before Halloween, and the town is gearing up for the Samhain festival. Forte admits that while he was familiar with Halloween, Samhain was a new concept. \"I was the person who would have said Sam Hain when I saw the word,\" he said.\n\nThe script contains a considerable amount of cursing, particularly by Cullen's character, Dove. However, as Cullen points out, cursing is part of how we communicate as Irish people, and it was liberating just to let go and curse freely on set.\n\n\"It's really freeing. It's part of how we communicate. I don't want to go around cursing children or anything, but there's freedom in how Dove says what she wants. That was really fun to play.\"", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Cork", "type":

He has a sunny disposition despite parts of his life falling apart. Sharing his thoughts on his character as Gilbert at the beginning of the series, Forte shared with Screen Rant:\n\n\"[Yeah], I think that he starts out just thinking it's just this colorful fluff piece.\"\n\nBritish actress Robyn Cara, famous for her films like Doctor Jekyll and on TV for Trying from 2020 to 2022, plays the role of Emmy. Her character will work directly with Gilbert as an eager and hardworking researcher and podcaster.\n\nDescribing her role as Emmy in Bodkin Season 1 with Screen Rant, Cara said:\n\n\"[Yeah], so she's very fresh. This is her first time out in the field, and she's looked up to Dove's investigative journalism career for so long now.\"\n\nDavid Wilmot who had roles in The Wonder, The Lies We Tell, Station Eleven, and The Crown, plays the charming but prone to violent outbursts Seamus Gallagher. He is a \"mysterious\" local in the series that Dove, Gilbert, and Emmy met once they arrived in an idyllic town in Ireland.\n\n5) Chris Walley as Sean O'Shea\n\n28-year-old Irish actor Chris Walley, best remembered for his appearances in The Young Offenders, Lies We Tell, and Bloodlands, plays Sean O'Shea. In the series, he is an Irish country lad known for his unrealizable nature. He rarely takes life seriously and is often wrapped up in some dodgy business.\n\nApart from the five primary cast members mentioned above, these are some of the additional cast and guest stars

Here, it's an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring.\n\nSaid podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They're joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn't make the more seasoned journalist's treatment of her any less frosty.\n\nIndeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she's slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier.\n\nAs with \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Local Hero,\" there's an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \"An American Werewolf in London\" into the stew as well.\n\nGilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography.\n\n\"He thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\" she grumbles, which is understandable given the \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers.\n\nForte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched - not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either.\n\nThe Obamas' Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \"Leave the World Behind\" to award-winning documentaries.\n\nCreated by Jez Scharf, \"Bodkin\" represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre - less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there's not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\n\"Bodkin\" premieres May 9 on Netflix.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_lowry@cnn.com", "name": "Brian Lowry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twin Peaks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiberno-English", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiberno-English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Werewolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procuring_(prostitution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procuring (prostitution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_the_World_Behind_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leave the World Behind (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_(Stevie_Wonder_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hangover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disneyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bodkin-102-unit-05610rc.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2838, "textEnd": 2843}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

They're necrophilia.\" So says Dove (Siobhan Cullen), an investigative reporter for The Guardian, whose disdain for professional podcasting would make even the most judgemental parent defend their child's chosen \"career.\" Throughout \"Bodkin,\" a fictional Netflix mystery set in a fictional Irish town about its fishy, fictional residents (and fictional visiting reporters), Dove never misses an opportunity to rail against the hottest nonfiction genre of the last decade or so. At first, it's hard to blame her. Certain true-crime podcasts, documentaries, and reports have faced criticism for years over unethical practices, whether it's playing loosey-goosey with the facts, disrespecting victims' privacy, or overextending its story for extra attention. Plus, after an untold number of narratives about missing kids and dead women, we're overdue, as a culture, to pivot away from true crime and into something new. (Maybe toward truly funny comedies?!)\n\nBut despite \"Bodkin\" making us aware that it knows what it is -- a meta version of those murder-mystery shows -- creator Jez Scharf doesn't have much to say about the genre. The series embodies trope after trope from famous true crime tales, and yet it never develops those ideas into something new or uses them to interrogate how they became tropes to begin with. Not quite a spoof, nor able to stand as its own mystery, in the end, the sharpest perspective seems to align with Dove's initial misgivings, and Scharf appears eager to bury the genre... right after spending seven hours acting out another one. Sure, hers isn't based in truth, but it's also not very convincing -- as a piece of criticism, or as its own drama.\n\nDove isn't the catalyst for what happens in \"Bodkin,\" but she is the main character. While working on a high-stakes story in London, Dove's primary source is compromised, and she finds him dead in his apartment. The authorities set her in their sights, suspicious of what she uncovered and how she uncovered it. Knowing Dove is a bit of a hot-head, her editor decides it's best for his ace reporter to lay low for a while, and since Dove doesn't know how to not work, he agrees to let her help with a low-key gig led by the paper's podcasting department.\n\nEnter: Gilbert Power (Will Forte), an American podcast host and producer who's touted as the company's superstar. He broke out with a deeply personal podcast chronicling his wife's battle with cancer, and now he's targeting another sad story from a small Irish town. Twenty-five years ago in Bodkin, three people disappeared during the local Halloween festival. They haven't held the event again since the tragedy, but this year, they're bringing it back, which gives Gilbert's story a timely peg. Along with his researcher, Emmy Sizergh (Robyn Cara), and Dove as a consultant (she's originally from Ireland), Gilbert hopes to hear what happened from the townsfolk themselves, and maybe nudge the investigation forward just a hair.\n\n\"And people will listen to that?\" The question becomes a refrain from anyone first hearing Gilbert's pitch, and it's about as close as \"Bodkin\" gets to acknowledging the original podcasting market's recent downturn. (Would a media company pay three staffers to travel to Ireland for a weeks-long investigation in 2024? Maybe! But the fiscal concerns that pop up for Gilbert have nothing to do with his long-term job security.) Other accuracy issues make it hard to invest in a world that feels phonier by the second. A female reporter sleeps with her subject again, and Dove's rampant lack of professionalism (or even common sense) butts up against her elite reputation. While she may be written to represent the no-nonsense journalists and cops who typically lone wolf their way through crime shows, Dove overdoes it. Even with the requisite traumatic backstory to excuse her current cold, cutting demeanor -- will she excise her own old demons while solving this case?! -- she's a liability for Gilbert and Emmy, not an asset.\n\nThe locals are imminently more interesting, thanks in part to a fever-pitch performance by David Wilmot as Seamus Gallagher, a fiery fisherman who forms a cantankerous connection with the bubbly Gilbert. Their scenes are a highlight, as Forte's well-meaning but oblivious tourist clashes and charms Wilmot's defensive yet boisterous villager. Their mercurial camaraderie certainly deserved more scenes like their roadside dance lesson.\n\nBut he, along with his friends and neighbors, are also written to be sympathetic, which gets complicated as the past comes to light. Time and time again, the people of Bodkin push back on Gilbert's inquiries. They're fine letting sleeping dogs lie, they say. They're ready to move on, to bring back the festival along with its better memories. The locals vs. the outsiders is framed as a battle over whose story merits hearing: the one that lets these people find peace, or the one that's exposed by these prying podcasters. Maybe they're one in the same. Maybe they're not. The importance of a good story is put on a pedestal, alongside the truth, but \"Bodkin\" never mounts a firm case for cold case journalism (which is easily defensible when handled by professionals) or one that substantially supports the victims.

Even in, like, November when the weather was noticeably colder we'd go in there for 10 minutes and you'd get out and just feel like Superman.'\n\nObituary and The Dry actress, Siobh\u00e1n, said she 'can attest to' the pair's off-set swimming habit.\n\nAsked if any other sea swimming enthusiasts twigged who they were, Siobh\u00e1n told the MoS Will would 'sometimes have people very politely coming up' to him on the east coast, but that Chris - who played Jock O'Keeffe in Young Offenders and is a Laurence Olivier Award-winning stage actor - 'can't move in Cork'.\n\n'Chris Walley is like the mayor of Cork,' she laughed.\n\n'You'd have people very kindly coming up to Will and saying \"I'm a huge fan of the show.\"' 'In Cork, though, it was a different story,' Siobh\u00e1n went on.\n\n'Because they'd kind of bypass Will and go straight to Chris Walley.'\n\n'But I'd get in there,' Will joked.\n\n'\"I'm an actor as well!\"' Will started out with Saturday Night Live and starred in the cult comedy series The Last Man on Earth.\n\nHe has also popped up in just about every US sitcom of the past two decades, from 30 Rock and How I Met Your Mother to The Simpsons and American Dad, as well as countless Hollywood films.\n\nIn Bodkin - the first scripted series for adults from Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions - Will plays a US podcaster landing in West Cork, to make a series about three unsolved disappearances.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n plays a hardened newspaper journalist unwillingly sent to accompany him along with her colleague, played by British actress Robyn Cara.\n\nShe dismissed any similarities between Bodkin's plot and the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in 1996 in West Cork, with Will agreeing the stories had 'nothing to do with' each other - though the cast had one near run-in with the late chief suspect Ian Bailey.\n\nWill explained: 'Me and Siobh\u00e1n and Robyn and Chris took a little road trip to Mizen Head and on the way back we had a little meal in Schull. And the guy, the alleged... Well, who knows? Nobody knows, except for him and his god. But he had supposedly been there, like an hour before.'\n\nThe California native admitted he was 'from time-to-time baffled' by the script's authentically Irish dialogue, but said he can now 'really pick everything out' of the day-to-day patter, having worked here for a third time on Bodkin.\n\n'I've spent so much time in Ireland that I really feel comfortable,' he said.\n\n'After [working here] the first time I fell in love with it so much that I would come here and vacation all the time. So I'm a little more on to you guys.'\n\n'Now it's just my old man ears when I go [affecting old man voice] \"What?\" It's not because of the accent - it's because of my failed hearing.'\n\nWhile Siobh\u00e1n's 'cynical' character Dove in Bodkin enjoys skewering the tourist ideal of Ireland, the 'slightly more optimistic' actress said she 'couldn't break Will's heart like that', adding that she 'would have no reason to'.\n\n'Especially when you're shooting somewhere like West Cork. You can't help but be like \"Yeah, in fairness, this is the most beautiful place in the world.\"'\n\nAnd unlike the cagey locals in the fictional town of Bodkin, the people of Glandore and Unionhall, where the seven-part series was shot, were 'so welcoming' - despite orders of '59 flat whites' in their cafes.\n\nWill said it was 'so easy to act' his character's wide-eyed appreciation for 'how green it is and how nice everybody is... because it's really how I feel' - or 'all improv' as Siobh\u00e1n put it.\n\n'I've been there so much now and nothing has thrown me off. I just love it. It's just a magical, beautiful place and everyone is so fun and so welcoming. And I just really feel so at home there.'\n\nPressed for a drawback (aside from the weather) Will said he 'feels bad when I go by some of the fields where the peat has all been chopped off - I heard that it doesn't grow back.\n\nSo sometimes there are some little eyesore-y places, but even they are not, like, superugly.'\n\nSiobh\u00e1n said it 'doesn't surprise' her that 'people's attention is sort of shining on Ireland' in film and TV production.\n\n'I think people are kind of clocking on to the fact that we have a wealth of beautiful locations to shoot in and we also have some of the best crews in the world. It just makes all the sense in the world to me.'\n\nWill said: 'I've spent about a year of my life in Ireland, maybe more, and every time everyone is so professional, so good at what they're doing, and also so nice and fun to hang out with.'\n\n'Everyone is just a little looser and just gives better performances when there's not any kind of weird tension on set,'.", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie",

Read on to find out.\n\nWhile the series is centred around a true crime podcast, Bodkin is not based on a true story.\n\nThe series poster boasts that the thriller is based on a true story, but has a footnote to say it's been \"overheard in a pub\". Actually, it's all been imagined in an age of true crime obsession, podcasts and the morality behind storytelling.\n\nBodkin has been created and written by British writer Jez Scharf, who describes the series as \"a commentary on stories of violence\", according to Tudum.\n\n\"At the time, I was thinking a lot about the morality of true crime,\" says Scharf. \"They're often very tragic stories, but are parcelled up into neat episodes with a good hook at the end.\"\n\nScharf serves as co-showrunner alongside fellow executive producer Alex Metcalf, who simply says of Bodkin: \"Not a real story, not a real place.\n\n\"It's a fake town, it's a fake place. It's all fake people. The mystery itself, we worked very hard to find something that is in no way adjacent to a real true crime story. The fictionality of it was very deliberate.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tone of Bodkin, Scharf said: \"My personal interest as a writer is always in absurdity, really -- in the idea that life is broadly absurd.\n\n\"Things that are sad are often funny, and vice versa. I think, having spent a lot of time in Ireland, there's a certain acceptance of that kind of tone [there].\"\n\nMetcalf also spoke of the series inspiration from some of the best known true crime podcasts like Serial and S-Town.\n\nKnown for being one of the first true crime podcasts ever, Serial is often cited as one of the best-known. While it is currently in its fourth season, it was its first - released in 2014 and centring on the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee - that really cemented it as one of the most influential podcasts, going on to inspire countless true crime iterations the world over.\n\nAs we see in Bodkin, Gilbert, Dove and Emmy are three unlikely people coming together to do a podcast centred on this small town and are regularly pulling out their dictaphones and microphones to capture content.\n\nDescribing Bodkin as \"a post-Serial story\", Metcalf said of Bodkin's podcast inspiration: \"Actually, of all the true crime podcasts, the one that was most inspiring to us was S-Town.\n\n\"That's one where you come in thinking it's going to be about a murder, but then the story just spins out in ways that you don't expect. That was the kind of journey that we were trying to map ourselves against -- that the truth is always kind of unexpected.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_cormack@radiotimes.com", "name": "Morgan Cormack", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Hae_Min_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Hae Min Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S-Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/BODKINNetflixcast-a310b8b.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Fair enough, Keoghan was dressed as a steampunk Willy Wonka and deserved a ribbing. But Vulture got the wrong end of the shillelagh and imagined Keoghan speaking in a sort of Lucky Charms fever dream patter - a speech pattern that, to non-Americans, read like previously unpublished lyrics to Come On Eileen by Dexy's Midnight Runners.\n\nMost Irish people rolled their eyes - but for those who didn't, similar delights await in Netflixh's toe-curling west Cork-set true crime dramedy Bodkin (on Netflix from Thursday). It's yet another entry in the worst genre ever - the Irish rural picaresque where booze flows, nuns scowl, and everyone enunciates like characters from an unproduced Martin McDonagh screenplay.\n\nBut for once, we can't blame the Banshees of Inisherin's mad-shtick man. Incredibly, Bodkin is produced by Barack and Michelle Obama under their $65 million deal with Netflix. In keeping with the thoughtful and socially conscious Obama brand, it sets out to critique our obsession with true crime podcasts and to have fun with Americans and their misty-eyed vision of Ireland. Yet while skewering Irish America, it indulges in plenty of stereotyping of its own and isn't nearly as clever as it fancies itself.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen stars as Dove, a Dublin-born reporter with the Guardian. She has a condescending and outmoded opinion of Ireland and is arm twisted into returning to Ireland to accompany irritating Irish-American Gilbert Power (Will Forte) as he makes a podcast about ritualised folk horror killings in west Cork.\n\nGiven her chip on the shoulder about the old country, Dove is predictably despairing of Will's romanticism. Yet if the locals in Bodkin are gradually revealed to be putting on a sly act in front of the naive American, the series nonetheless plumbs the depths of diddly dee twaddle.\n\n[ Patrick Freyne: On Selling the OC, Alex has the recipe for a good relationship. It's a nice, alliterative list - all the C-words ]\n\nIn particular, it fails to do any justice whatsoever to west Cork - a place that, depending on the time, company and quality of daylight, can feel overpoweringly cosmopolitan and as if it is on the final approach to the ends of the earth. Here, it's just Netflix recreating Father Ted without the jokes or self-awareness.\n\nBodkin is the work of Londoner Jez Scharf, who spent time in west Cork as a teenager. A little knowledge truly is dangerous as he has populated his script with the standard rowdy, shifty, dysfunctional peasants who say \"me\" instead of \"my\" and swear as if paid by the f-bomb.\n\nAmid all the grunting and gurning, you have to feel for the Irish cast, who must be aware of the nonsense to which they are reduced (Pat Shortt plays a version of his D'Unbelievables character, though here it is presented as a straight dramatic role).\n\nA word, too, about the title. Bodkin is the name of the village where the murders occurred and which now holds an annual Samhain festival.\n\n\"Bodkin\" is obviously made up and feels like a passive-aggressive commentary on silly Irish placenames. But of course, these names aren't silly. No matter how whimsical they may sound to outside ears, they are blunt-force English translations from the original Irish. This isn't an obscure point: Brian Friel's Translations is about that very subject.\n\nThe lesson, alas, soars over the head of Bodkin, a deeply annoying show that thinks it is critiquing cliches about Ireland when actively adding to the stockpile. Let's ignore it and hope it goes away.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Enter writer Jez Scharf and the Irish-set Bodkin, a delicious fish-out-of-water seven-part Netflix series that balances genuine detective thrills with laid-back laughs. Think Father Ted meets Twin Peaks - with a lot more eels.\n\nAmerican star Will Forte (a Saturday Night Live alumnus, whose movie work includes Nebraska and MacGruber) plays Gilbert Power, an American podcaster over in Ireland seeking out his Irish roots. Arriving in the fictional town of Bodkin, he's joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), an enthusiastic researcher, out in the field for the first time. And then there's Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the cynical investigative reporter sent back to West Cork by her editor to lay low after a scandal and help out Gilbert.\n\nThe plan is to research into the disappearance of three youngsters from years earlier - including the brother of local bigwig Seamus (David Wilmot). But soon Dove is digging into what's really going on Bodkin, a town where criminality lurks just beneath the surface. Dressed in a long black coat and sunglasses, looking a bit like Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity from The Matrix, her hard-bitten credentials will always lead her to look for the story behind the story.\n\nSure enough, the locals start taking umbrage with Dove and co. poking their noses into their business. \"Let the past go - it's done nothing to you,\" says one, while Dove is soon accosted by two balaclava-wearing assailants as they attempt to scare her off the beaten track. Suddenly, cars are set on fire and a country that's \"never even had a serial killer\" begins to look as suspect as Donald Trump's end-of-year accounts.\n\nWithout going too weird, Scharf does conjure up an amusing picture of rural Ireland, where locals play bizarre games (bowling a metal ball down the country roads) or drive a tractor with disco lights and a speaker blaring out Amii Stewart's 'Knock on Wood'. There's also plenty of spooky goings-on, like the wolf that appears just about everywhere that Dove goes, as a mystery murkier than an Irish bog unfurls.\n\nWhile the humour is largely low-key, Forte amuses as the Yankee exploring the Emerald Isle, especially when he puts on his earnest 'podcast presenter' voice. But it takes two (or three) to tango, and Cara and Cullen bring just as much to the table. In particular, Cullen is neatly cast as the ballsy hack who thinks nothing of snooping around residents' houses or telling a child to \"fuck off\" when they insult her new sunglasses.\n\nAway from the main trio, The Young Offenders' Chris Walley pops up as Se\u00e1n, who becomes the main gang's driver when he isn't disappearing for hours on end. But gradually you'll come to love all the characters in this quirky ensemble. It's a slow-burner, filling your glass gradually like a good pint of Guinness. But sup down one episode and you'll be racing through the rest, desperate to crack open Bodkin's multiple mysteries.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News,

Twenty-odd years ago, three members of Bodkin's community went missing under suspicious circumstances on the night of Samhain - a Gaelic festival which falls on the same day as Halloween.\n\nThough Gilbert often serves as the narrator, the series is largely driven by the unbearably selfish, irrevocably damaged and entirely unlikeable Dove. Emmy, meanwhile, wants to be just like her disillusioned mentor and, despite becoming aware of Dove's shortcomings as a human being, Emmy is led down a similar road of self-absorbed abandon.\n\nDon't let Gilbert's gentle exterior fool you, though. He is perhaps the worst of them all; a podcasting one-hit-wonder who is hell-bent on getting his career back on track, winning back the love of his estranged wife, and making millions at the expense of Bodkin's tight-knit community in the process.\n\nWhat makes Gilbert and Dove different is that the former pretends to be a good person, while the latter (at the very least) has no qualms with embracing her manipulative personality. Emmy sits flits between the two depending on the episode, making her character fickle and frustrating to follow.\n\nBodkin was created by Jez Scharf, and also happens to be executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama via their production company Higher Ground. Though the ingredients are there to lure viewers into an instant binge-watch, it ends up being is a real disappointment.\n\nPegged as a darkly comic murder mystery, the entangled plot is packed full of what Gilbert himself refers to as \"red herrings\". These consistently ridiculous sub-plots lead nowhere in an attempt to trick the viewer into thinking they've inched closer to uncovering the mystery at hand.\n\nInstead of kick-starting the adrenaline rush that leads us to watch an entire series in one sitting, these red herrings result in an overall feeling of remarkable disinterest. From illegal eels, illicit hippie communities and Romanian adoptions to not-so retired smugglers and Irish gangs, the series is awash with a tidal wave of glaringly obvious and tired distractions.\n\nEven worse, the sub-par nature of the story is consistently lamented upon by the protagonists attempting to drive it. In episode one, Dove says \"True Crime podcasts aren't journalism, they're necrophilia.\" We hear Gilbert's wife utter, \"We can't fix this in the edit\" in episode six.\n\nThe show's self-referential nature tries to be clever, but doesn't achieve much. Rather than offering a darkly intellectual, pseudo-supernatural piece of meta comedy, Bodkin instead hinges upon a poorly developed plot which could easily serve as a just-about passable creative writing task for English Language GCSE.\n\nDove longs to be as far away from her ancestral homeland as possible, Emmy disappears into the arms of ridiculous love interests, and Gilbert plunges further into his self-obsessive soliloquys. The motley trio seem just as desperate to ditch the damp squib of a story as the viewer.\n\nAs the three podcasters continue to pull on threads that they have no business investigating, Bodkin is set alight (quite literally) with entirely unnecessary mayhem. At times, the series has stylistic elements which are reminiscent of big hitters such as Big Little Lies, Fleabag and even Stranger Things.\n\nBodkin, however, lacks the magical quality that makes those other shows spectacular. We couldn't care less about the town or its inhabitants because the creators have failed to produce a single character worth rooting for.\n\nThe ironically lifeless murder mystery is only redeemed by some much-needed comic relief, some fancy title sequences and a fabulous score filled with Gaelic music. For a show that's entire shtick is about the power of a good story in true Irish-revival fashion, it fails to tell one that has any real effect.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eponym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red herring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge-watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binge-watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Gaelic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hippie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/0990ea8b5b75e2f2fbb2cedfc2afc0c7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Since the series revolves around a true-crime podcast, people might wonder if Bodkin is based on a true story. Let's find out!\n\nBodkin is not based on a true story. Though the series is centered on true-crime podcasters, its events and plot are entirely fictional. The show is a satire on how some podcasters get way too dramatic while discussing a true crime and blur the lines between facts and fiction.\n\nTo engross the audiences, the show's makers put the message 'Based on a True Story' in the trailer; however, it was followed up with a footnote reading, 'Overheard in a Pub.' This move further mocks the people who take a tragic story and turn it on its head to make it a fun watch and gain some views.\n\nTalking about Bodkin, series creator Jez Schacf said in an interview with Tudum, \"It's a fake town, it's a fake place. It's all fake people. The mystery itself, we worked very hard to find something that is in no way adjacent to a real true-crime story. The fictionality of it was very deliberate.\"\n\nHowever, Schacf added that some real-world true-crime podcasts inspired him to develop the show's idea. The two podcasts he was most impacted by are Serial and S-Town. Serial, owned by The New York Times, is an investigative journalism podcast that started airing in 2014 and has gained a cult following over the years. On the other hand, S-Town, produced by Brian Reed and Julie Snyder, aired in 2017 and won several accolades.\n\nSchacf revealed that he had consumed so many true-crime documentaries and podcasts in the past that he started to question the morality of the same, and hence, he was inspired to make Bodkin. \"At the time, I was thinking a lot about the morality of true crime. They're often very tragic stories but are parceled up into neat episodes with a good hook at the end,\" added the creator in his interview. Hence, Bodkin is not based on a true story, but the show is a satirical take on true-crime podcasts of the real world.", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jashandeep_singh@koimoi.com", "name": "Jashandeep Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S-Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Snyder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julie Snyder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2024/05/is-netflixs-bodkin-based-on-a-true-story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Coming into 'Bodkin', however, it's only fair that the shields are up. After all, it's a murder-mystery set in a sleepy Irish town that hides a dark secret long buried being dragged up by a true-crime podcast with a cast of colourful characters populating said Irish town. So far, so hum.\n\nYet 'Bodkin' manages to assuage those well-founded fears from the outset in the form of Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, best known to audiences here from her role in 'The Dry' alongside Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Roisin Gallagher. Playing a hardened, cynical journalist who's left Ireland for London, her scepticism and utter contempt for diddley-eye bollocks is a welcome foil to Will Forte's beguiled, naive sentimentality about the place. Forte, who's more than capable of playing a hapless wonder from the likes of 'The Last Man on Earth' and cult favourite 'MacGruber', pings off Cullen like it's rubber and glue, with Robyn Cara caught between them as the equally bewildered research assistant.\n\nAs to the charming locals, it's a trove of Irish talent, led by the incomparable David Wilmot. Switching between settled warmth and charm to blood-curdling terror and intense rage in the blink of an eye, Wilmot is more than capable of standing in for the inherent dissonance in our own identity. Yes, it's beautiful and it's quaint at times, but there's a bleakness and a darkness right underneath. Chris Walley, late of 'The Young Offenders', plays a scheming driver while Denis Conway plays the local Garda with a fiendish twist that's all too familiar. David Pearse, always reliably sinister, turns up a New Age Traveller who believes in peace, love, and collecting debts by any means necessary while Pat Shortt turns up as a farmer caught up in the conspiracy.\n\nOn the surface, it's easy to make a comparison with 'Only Murders In The Building' in that it's a true-crime podcast that's self-aware enough to acknowledge how worn out the genre is. Much of the first episode sees the townspeople of Bodkin asking in that genial but insulting way if anyone would actually listen to it, and later we find nuns and shopkeepers talking about their favourite true-crime shows. Yet, where the comparison deviates is that 'Bodkin' is completely comfortable going to far more sinister, twisted places than anything 'Only Murders In The Building' might have explored. Moreover, the deep reserves of biting sarcasm and bitterness provided by Siobh\u00e1n Cullen and David Wilmot is enough to congeal any sense of fizziness.\n\nWhen you come away from 'Bodkin', much like the namesake, the blade goes in deeper than you think. Marked with sharp writing throughout, quick and nimble directing, and a cast more than able to slice up thrills and comedy with ease, 'Bodkin' catches the gleam in the blade.", "source": {"uri": "entertainment.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_lloyd@entertainment.ie", "name": "Brian Lloyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roisin_Gallagher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roisin Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dry_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dry (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGruber_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacGruber (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Man_on_Earth_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last Man on Earth (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar\u00e1n_Hinds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Walley_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Walley (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Offenders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Young Offenders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Shortt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Shortt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish Travellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarcasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.entertainment.ie/uploads/2024/05/09115235/Bodkin.png?w=1280&h=768&q=high", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

All seven episodes of the series will be released on the streamer on May 9, 2024.\n\n\"Bodkin is a dark comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters (Will Forte, Siobh\u00e1n Cullen, Robyn Cara) who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in a quaint, coastal Irish town. But once they start pulling at threads, they discover a story much bigger and weirder than they could have ever imagined,\" says the synopsis. \"As our heroes try to discern fact from fiction -- about the case, about their colleagues, and, most painfully, themselves -- the series challenges our perception of truth and exposes the stories we tell ourselves to justify our beliefs or validate our fears.\"\n\nTyler Treese: Will, this show's definitely comedic and in a very dark way, but you get to show so much great emotion as your character, Gilbert, as well, especially when you're opening up about Gilbert's wife. I thought those were some of the best scenes. So what was most rewarding about really getting to show your full range here?\n\nWill Forte: I mean, these scripts were so beautifully written that it's hard to not do a good job acting them. They really set you up to do it well. It's exciting being somebody who came from comedy, getting a chance to do scenes that are like this. But really, it does help when they help you out with the words and the situations so much, it really does give you a leg up. I definitely could not do it without the wonderful words and the people that you're acting with.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Cullen: You're being modest. You're so good, those scenes are special.\n\nRobyn Cara: They're really great.\n\nSiobhan, your character, Dove, is this great investigative journalist, but she's definitely putting her job and story first here. She's this great ice queen. There's a coldness to her. How is it when you have such a nice and friendly cast, but you're being rude to them throughout? Some of your lines are hilarious,\n\nCullen: It comes very naturally to me. No, I'm joking.\n\nBut it is kind of fun to get to play those kind of parts, particularly when you maybe don't necessarily kind of connect with them on that level if it's a total departure from what I hope is your natural disposition. It's great, and I think there's a real freedom in kind of getting to play someone who doesn't care about what people think of her and just kind of does and says exactly what she wants. I think there's a real freedom to that.\n\nForte: Oh yeah. I've got a spoiler for you that she was an ice queen in the show, but off the set, she was the nice queen. N-I-C-E queen. Respect queen. Friendly queen. Everybody involved in this, except for Robyn, was so nice and respectful and just everyone got along [laughs].\n\nRobyn, your character, Emmy, is so great in this as well. Siobh\u00e1n has this great line where she says everything you say sounds like you're apologizing, but we see Emmy really stand up for herself as the series goes on. There's this one great scene where you really tell off Dove, and it's very unexpected. What do you like most about seeing that growth throughout the series?\n\nCara: Anyone's gonna love a character that kind of has a proper journey in there.

But as traditional journalist Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), veteran podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte), and assistant Emmy (Robyn Cara) work to uncover the mystery, the dark comedy/thriller also explores the nature of making a true crime project -- especially what it means to explore, and maybe even arguably exploit, sensitive subject matter.\n\nSpeaking with Consequence alongside her two co-stars, Cullen says that \"Our show touches on the sort of ethical and moral aspect of what goes into making a true crime podcast. And it questions it, I think, in a really smart way.\"\n\nAs Robyn Cara adds, making the series made it clear to her that \"it's hard to make a true crime podcast, and go into these people's lives. It's like a weird boundary thing.\"\n\nCullen agrees, noting that \"I love listening to true crime podcasts, and podcasts in general, and [Bodkin] has made me listen with a kind of a fresh ear of, you know, 'Is this okay, that we're using these real stories and treating them as entertainment?' It just gives you kind of a fresh outlook on it.\"\n\nSays Will Forte, joking: \"She said exactly what I was gonna say, but in half the time and with a less annoying voice.\"\n\nKey to the show's charms is the complicated yet increasingly warm dynamic between its three core characters as well as the relationships that emerge between the outsiders and the townsfolk they encounter. Cullen attributes this chemistry first to the fact that \"we all like each other a lot. We kind of hit it off very naturally from the get go.\"\n\nAnd Forte wants to note that their on-and-off-screen connection came \"very quick,\" perhaps because \"we spent the most time with each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "consequence.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Consequence of Sound"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_shannon_miller@consequence.net", "name": "Liz Shannon Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequence_(publication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consequence (publication)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bodkin-robyn-cara-siobhan-cullen-will-forte.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Here, it's an American podcaster invading a quirky Irish town, nosing around a cold case that yields a steadily diminishing drip from this Irish spring.\n\nSaid podcaster Gilbert (Will Forte) comes with his share of baggage, as does Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), the investigative reporter grudgingly assigned to accompany him. They're joined by Emmy (Robyn Cara), a bright-eyed young researcher who looks up to Dove, which doesn't make the more seasoned journalist's treatment of her any less frosty.\n\nIndeed, Dove makes clear she feels like she's slumming in pandering to this request (order, actually) from her bosses to squire Gilbert through his mission, at least until they begin to chip away at the layers surrounding what might have happened to three people who disappeared a quarter-century earlier.\n\nAs with \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Local Hero,\" there's an odd quaintness to the town Gilbert finds charming, but as is so often the case, the cheery exterior for tourists and rubes hides a darker underbelly. That includes guardedness toward outsiders that introduces a pinch of \"An American Werewolf in London\" into the stew as well.\n\nGilbert approaches the whole exercise from a very different perspective than Dove, who becomes engaged by the prospect of cracking the case, while he simply wants to put on a good show, prompting her to liken his work less to journalism than pornography.\n\n\"He thinks Ireland is some kind of Disneyland,\" she grumbles, which is understandable given the \"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\" setting, with even more heavy drinking and pounding hangovers.\n\nForte is happily more subdued than he often tends to be, but Gilbert is still a reluctant sleuth, which makes Dove (played with a nicely crusty edge by Cullen, an Irish actor) the true driver of this story. Over the seven episodes, that arc becomes increasingly convoluted and a trifle far-fetched - not fatal flaws, but not helpful ones either.\n\nThe Obamas' Higher Ground production company has become a prolific supplier to Netflix, from movies like \"Leave the World Behind\" to award-winning documentaries.\n\nCreated by Jez Scharf, \"Bodkin\" represents a low-key addition to that slate, but still makes for a passable binge; still, what looks like a distinctive show gradually blends into its saturated genre - less a commentary on true-crime podcasts than a reminder that even with series that start out well, there's not always a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\n\"Bodkin\" premieres May 9 on Netflix.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Send in the Podcasters", "body": "This Netflix series is about a true-crime podcast but plays more like a mopey murder show.\n\nThere are worse shows to imitate than \"Only Murders in the Building,\" and perhaps \"Bodkin,\" premiering Thursday on Netflix, would be better if it had tried. It too is about the creation of a true-crime podcast, set in an enclave where quirky conflicts simmer for decades. It too pokes fun at the inanity of some podcasts, and it tries to weave a comedic pep into its pathos.\n\nBut \"Bodkin,\" created by Jez Scharf and executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, among others, takes more inspiration from mopey foreign murder shows. It has that common pervasive dampness along with plenty of clannish townspeople who resent these nosy Nellies poking around where they have no business. None! [Cue the jangling of the bells hung above the doorway in a quaint shop.]\n\nYes, there is a spooky local festival, and yes, the town's top pastime is keeping dark secrets. No one asks direct questions, nor can anyone speak for long without drifting into a dreamy parable. The show is set in the present day, but the surroundings feel ancient.\n\nOur town here is Bodkin, a (fictional) Irish village where years ago, during the annual celebration of Samhain (a Gaelic proto-Halloween), three people disappeared. Now our podcasters are on the case: Gilbert (Will Forte), a mostly cheery American with some successful podcasts under his belt; Dove (Siobhan Cullen), a Dublin-raised, London-based reporter who perceives this assignment as a banishment; and Emmy (Robyn Cara), the eager research assistant who tolerates their shabby treatment. Gilbert is vaguely dopey but ingratiating. Dove is so sour she could pickle a sociopath. To the show's credit, at least they do not hook up with each other.\n\nDove says that true-crime stories aren't real journalism, and while we're led to believe she is an ace reporter, she seems unfamiliar with one of the core aspects of news gathering: earning the trust of potential sources. She is surly and rude to nearly everyone she meets. She breaks into a library after hours just because she's impatient. Back in London, she had promised to protect a whistle-blower's identity, but his name leaked somehow, and he later killed himself. This arc never fully meshes with the rest of the show, and it plays out mostly in terse phone calls. But everything with Dove is so one-note, it's hard to see the specifics of her disrespect. Similarly, Gilbert's money trouble and failing marriage -- more phone calls -- feel like tacked-on inventions rather than enriching character depth.\n\nWill there ever be a show in which a female journalist doesn't sleep with a source or subject? The search continues. Emmy falls for the local tech wunderkind and Dove for the sharp funeral director. Gilbert too becomes awfully enmeshed, befriending Seamus (David Wilmot), a local fisherman with a, yes, fishy past. Forte and Wilmot have the most interesting chemistry in the show: Gilbert is eager for good sound bites and Seamus loves to pontificate, but their deeper purposes are at odds. Neither can fully mask his prickly distrust, but both are desperate for the connection anyway. It's a dangerous, fruitful combo.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margaret_lyons@nytimes.com", "name": "Margaret Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hook (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child prodigy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/08/multimedia/08bodkin-hfwl/08bodkin-hfwl-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

That it doesn't ever quite catch fire in the same way as that highly idiosyncratic show is unfortunate, if predictable, but not fatal to enjoyment.\n\nWill Forte (SNL regular, creator and star of The Last Man on Earth and, most importantly to some of us, Jenna's boyfriend - when not on sexual walkabout - Paul L'astnam\u00e9 in 30 Rock) plays podcaster Gilbert Power. Having had one hit by documenting his wife's cancer, he is now looking to move into the true-crime genre - and explore his Irish roots - by heading to the small town of Bodkin, in west Cork, where three people went missing from the annual Samhain (think of it as Gaelic Halloween) festival 20 years ago. He takes his earnest young researcher, Emmy Scissor (Robyn Cara) - a name as painfully effortful as that of the fictional town Bodkin itself - with him. They are reluctantly joined by investigative reporter Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), whose editor is demanding that she takes some time off and keeps her head down after the whistleblower who was her central source for a story about an NHS scandal is found dead, apparently by his own hand. Dove is clearly mardy at the best of times, and this is not the best of times but Emmy worships her as a journalistic role model regardless of how many times Dove tells her to fuck off. (This makes me feel the great lack of people worshipping me as a journalistic role model despite telling almost everyone I meet to fuck off, but I shall think about that later.)\n\nThe locals are, at first, much as you would expect. There is a garrulous pair of old codgers, Barry and Cathal (John Olohan and Brendan Conroy), a happy-go-lucky lad Sean (Chris Walley) as their hopeless taxi driver, a formidable landlady at their B&B, Mrs O'Shea (Pom Boyd, recently seen as alcoholic clan mother Bernie in funny, clever The Dry), a shady fisher with a history of smuggling, Seamus Gallagher (David Wilmot), friendly farmer Darragh (Pat Shortt), bruiser Frank (David Pearse - also currently Brother Edwig in Shardlake, who is also a bit of a bruiser so you shouldn't get too confused), sensitive blacksmith and angelic singer Teddy (Ger Kelly), blustery old-school garda Sgt Power (Denis Conway) and local bullied boy made good and come back (to start up the Samhain festival again) Fintan (Charlie Kelly) - also known as Shitpants after a school incident because \"we're a very literal people\". And nuns, of course. Some drinking Guinness in the bar, some running a desanctified nunnery as a wellness retreat for the cash.\n\nGradually, the plot unfurls, the characters' backstories and current stories are revealed, connections between them emerge and it becomes clear that at least half the time the quaint Irishness that enchants Gilbert is an act designed to deflect his questions and derail his inquiries into the missing trio. Dove remains clearer-eyed and it is thanks to her - and the occasional borderline criminal acts of Emmy - that they uncover several interlinked mysteries that need solving and that may give Gilbert the hit show he desperately needs.\n\nIt all works, in the end. By the third episode, Bodkin has found its groove and settled into it. There is enough credibility to the mystery, enough jokes to keep it from becoming a straight thriller (including small touches like a singalong starting to Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow at a wake) and enough oddity to keep things interesting without unbalancing the whole. It gains in pace, charm (and in dead bodies) and that first hour turns out to be an investment worth making.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_mangan@theguardian.com", "name": "Lucy Mangan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groove (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Man_on_Earth_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last Man on Earth (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kelly_(It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samhain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Walley_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Walley (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Shortt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Shortt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e687877c42b299abe6fc38ea12cfc8497309b86c/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&s=ea94ef0373c8afb5112d6f4b2f1094a2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Following on the heels of \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu), \"Based on a True Story\" (Peacock) and \"Truth Be Told\" (Apple TV+), we can add \"Bodkin,\" a seven-episode thriller on Netflix about a trio who arrive in the sleepy Irish town of the title to investigate the disappearance of three strangers who went missing 20 years earlier.\n\n(If Hollywood is so eager to greenlight shows that reflect our world back to us, why haven't we seen a bunch about union organizing? But I digress. True crime podcasters it is.)\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" alum Will Forte (the sole American in the cast) plays Gilbert, whose first podcast made him into a minor star. He hasn't been able to replicate his initial success and as a one-hit wonder, he's driven by professional desperation. Siobha\u0301n Cullen plays Dove, an Irish newspaper journalist based in London. When a story she's working on proves too dangerous, her boss reassigns her to work with Gilbert and she reluctantly agrees. Off they go to Bodkin with a young and inexperienced assistant of sorts named Emmy (Robyn Cara). Her job description is unclear, but that's the least of the issues that hamper the series. It's too bad because it starts off promisingly enough.\n\nThe show isn't a satire so much as a misty, murky thriller that (initially, at least) has some decent sardonic energy driving it. There's a running joke every time they explain the podcast to someone new: \"And people will listen to it?\" comes the amused if dubious reply. The show also pokes fun at cliches about Ireland's beauty while also capturing said beauty. \"Is it raining? I can't tell,\" Gilberts asks at one point. \"It's just sort of a wet breeze?\" Emmy wonders. A local interrupts their conversation: \"It stays raining in Ireland. Even when you think it's dry, it's still raining, only very, very small drops.\"\n\nCatching sight of a nun in a pub, Gilbert is just thrilled: \"I love this country!\" He's open-faced and derpy, but he also takes a patient and thoughtful approach to the work: \"Journalism isn't just squeezing people for information, we're here to build relationships.\" Dove scoffs. She's hard-bitten, stony-faced and nursing some childhood traumas that have made her perpetually suspicious of everyone. She doesn't want to be here! Emmy is caught in the middle, between these two more seasoned investigators, and trying to keep the peace.\n\nAs they make the rounds, they run into plenty of resistance. \"Let the past go,\" someone implores. \"It's done nothing to you.\" Tempers explode, corpses are found in the trunk of a car and money is stapled to a man's forehead (don't ask). But the mystery of who went missing, and why, is too shaggy, too convoluted and meandering, to make any kind of sense or keep you locked in. Mysteries should be complicated but not hard to follow.\n\nI kept waiting for the series (from Jez Scharf, who is showrunner with Alex Metcalf) to find its narrative footing, but it lacks the kind of methodical unraveling needed to sustain interest. The cast of characters remain undeveloped beyond their surface-level tropes. There's not even a sense of what this podcast will sound like.\n\n\"Bodkin\" is the first scripted series from Higher Ground, the production company formed by Barack and Michelle Obama \"to tell powerful stories that entertain.\" It's a piffle of a show and probably not what most audiences would expect a former two-term U.S. president to put his name and energy behind. Higher Ground doesn't have to make more important-seeming or creatively substantial scripted fare, necessarily, but it does need to make good TV if it wants to be taken seriously.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_metz@theolympian.com", "name": "Nina Metz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Be_Told_(2019_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Be Told (2019 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hit_wonder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One-hit wonder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_gag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running gag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/rv1q4a/picture288433193/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/f1512e46-cf57-4ec0-add6-2fde5fa1d182", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Tonally it feels more grounded and while there are laughs, they aren't as broad.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Forte himself had the following to say about the show's release, praising all of his collaborators:\n\nBODKIN is out NOW on [Netflix]. What a joy it's been to be a part of this. An amazingly talented cast and crew who all became like a little family. Please check it out if you get a chance.\n\nPersonally, we're happy to recommend the series to anyone who wants a good mystery, or a chance to check out a fun little story that lasts for a handful of episodes. It is not going to garner headlines as transformative television, but it is an extremely enjoyable romp that would be a perfect way to spend time on a weekend. Also, it may give you a hankering to explore the Irish countryside more.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more discussion on Bodkin, including some season 2 possibilities\n\nShare right now in the attached comments!

When a suspicious death occurs in their building, the trio decides to investigate the case themselves, documenting their findings in a podcast of their own. Only Murders in the Building's premise bears a striking resemblance to Bodkin, as both series feature protagonists who are drawn into solving mysteries while creating podcasts.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building blends just the right amount of dark humor with gripping crime thriller elements, creating a compelling narrative that makes the series the perfect mystery TV show that keeps viewers guessing.

Following on the heels of \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu), \"Based on a True Story\" (Peacock) and \"Truth Be Told\" (Apple TV+), we can add \"Bodkin,\" a seven-episode thriller on Netflix about a trio who arrive in the sleepy Irish town of the title to investigate the disappearance of three strangers who went missing 20 years earlier.\n\n(If Hollywood is so eager to greenlight shows that reflect our world back to us, why haven't we seen a bunch about union organizing? But I digress. True crime podcasters it is.)\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" alum Will Forte (the sole American in the cast) plays Gilbert, whose first podcast made him into a minor star. He hasn't been able to replicate his initial success and as a one-hit wonder, he's driven by professional desperation. Siobha\u0301n Cullen plays Dove, an Irish newspaper journalist based in London. When a story she's working on proves too dangerous, her boss reassigns her to work with Gilbert and she reluctantly agrees. Off they go to Bodkin with a young and inexperienced assistant of sorts named Emmy (Robyn Cara). Her job description is unclear, but that's the least of the issues that hamper the series. It's too bad because it starts off promisingly enough.\n\nThe show isn't a satire so much as a misty, murky thriller that (initially, at least) has some decent sardonic energy driving it. There's a running joke every time they explain the podcast to someone new: \"And people will listen to it?\" comes the amused if dubious reply. The show also pokes fun at cliches about Ireland's beauty while also capturing said beauty. \"Is it raining? I can't tell,\" Gilberts asks at one point. \"It's just sort of a wet breeze?\" Emmy wonders. A local interrupts their conversation: \"It stays raining in Ireland. Even when you think it's dry, it's still raining, only very, very small drops.\"\n\nCatching sight of a nun in a pub, Gilbert is just thrilled: \"I love this country!\" He's open-faced and derpy, but he also takes a patient and thoughtful approach to the work: \"Journalism isn't just squeezing people for information, we're here to build relationships.\" Dove scoffs. She's hard-bitten, stony-faced and nursing some childhood traumas that have made her perpetually suspicious of everyone. She doesn't want to be here! Emmy is caught in the middle, between these two more seasoned investigators, and trying to keep the peace.\n\nAs they make the rounds, they run into plenty of resistance. \"Let the past go,\" someone implores. \"It's done nothing to you.\" Tempers explode, corpses are found in the trunk of a car and money is stapled to a man's forehead (don't ask). But the mystery of who went missing, and why, is too shaggy, too convoluted and meandering, to make any kind of sense or keep you locked in. Mysteries should be complicated but not hard to follow.\n\nI kept waiting for the series (from Jez Scharf, who is showrunner with Alex Metcalf) to find its narrative footing, but it lacks the kind of methodical unraveling needed to sustain interest. The cast of characters remain undeveloped beyond their surface-level tropes. There's not even a sense of what this podcast will sound like.\n\n\"Bodkin\" is the first scripted series from Higher Ground, the production company formed by Barack and Michelle Obama \"to tell powerful stories that entertain.\" It's a piffle of a show and probably not what most audiences would expect a former two-term U.S. president to put his name and energy behind. Higher Ground doesn't have to make more important-seeming or creatively substantial scripted fare, necessarily, but it does need to make good TV if it wants to be taken seriously.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_metz@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Nina Metz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Be_Told_(2019_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Be Told (2019 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hit_wonder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One-hit wonder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saturday Night Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_gag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running gag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CTC-L-BODKIN-02-e1714929980386.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Following Hulu's Only Murders in the Building and Peacock's Based on a True Story is Netflix's Bodkin. A serviceable if unspectacular seven-part series, it's set in a fictional Irish town that's home to a disturbing cold case and some very frosty locals.\n\nDigging into the past with a Dictaphone in one hand -- and often a Guinness in another -- is audio storyteller Gilbert Power (Will Forte), who arrives from the US in search of macabre mysteries and an idyllic backdrop for a Guardian-produced podcast. Bodkin, a scenic coastal community, offers both, having been the site of an unsolved triple-disappearance at a festival 25 years earlier. It's also, to Gilbert's disappointment, now the location of a tech server farm. \"There's still small quaint stuff here right?\" he frets.\n\nJoining Gilbert is jaundiced journalist Dove (Siobh\u00e1n Cullen), who's begrudgingly reassigned to the podcast after a recent expos\u00e9 left a key source fatally exposed. Having departed Ireland years ago, she harbours no affection for her country, nor displays any interest in such a small story. That is until she's warned by two masked assailants to stop snooping around. \"We are being threatened\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009this is extremely good news\".\n\nIt quickly transpires that everyone in town -- from the drunken police sergeant to menacing, melancholy fisherman Seamus (David Wilmot) -- is hiding something. While Gilbert seeks to spin a good yarn by boozing and carousing with the locals, Dove ruffles some feathers in her search for the truth. Caught in the middle is researcher Emmy (Robyn Cara), as green as the emerald isle herself.\n\nWhile the series neatly piles on the suspense and intrigue, it feels light on the dark comedy. There are few wry quips at the expense of podcasting gimmicks, Gilbert's American optimism and Dove's lugubrious schtick, but actual laughs are scarce and the tone verges on gloomy. Crucially, it struggles to build an engaging rapport between the odd-couple characters. If you're here for the craic rather than the crime, you might be left wanting more.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Based_on_a_True_Story_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Based on a True Story (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Only Murders in the Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictaphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictaphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Forte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Forte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siobh\u00e1n_Cullen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siobh\u00e1n Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macabre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macabre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaundice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilmot_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Wilmot (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fd577db8f-f941-4c6d-a895-7ec8b1a0e0c5.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545820", "eventUri": "eng-9545820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Or, are we at the end of the story now?\n\nWe should start off here by recognizing that there may be some out there who haven't heard much about the new Will Forte mystery, which is somewhat under the radar. Yet, it is also a delightfully fun watch.\n\nBODKIN is a darkly comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in an idyllic, coastal Irish town. But once they start pulling at threads, they discover a story much bigger and weirder than they could have ever imagined. As our heroes try to discern fact from fiction -- about the case, about their colleagues, and, most painfully, themselves -- the series challenges our perception of truth and exposes the stories we tell ourselves to justify our beliefs or validate our fears.\n\nWell, let's just say that for now, everything remains somewhat up in the air -- nothing has been decided! We will say that the first season does tie together all loose ends, so there is a chance that it just ends up being a limited series. There is value to having stories that are so complete and total.\n\nNow, in the event that we do get something more down the road, our sentiment is that it would be a totally new mystery that gives us an opportunity to see these main characters in a different capacity ... but would that also still be Bodkin? That's what makes the show tricky, given that one of the main characters of the series is the idyllic Irish community. The characters and the world there do feel so fundamentally unique.\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

Carville, known for his political takes and for his stewardship of Bill Clinton\u2019s successful 1992 presidential campaign, said the advanced ages of President Joe Biden and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump are partly to blame. \u201c[Young people] feel like things are not working for them,\u201d Carville said on the Cats Roundtable radio show. \u201cThey feel like \u2014 two 80-year-old guys that don\u2019t mean much to them.

During the interview, Carville said he\u2019s voting for Biden but feels the party has better options in its younger ranks. \u201cWe have a choice to make in November,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a choice that I was crazy about. I actually was very public that I thought President Biden should not run for reelection. But he did.\u201dCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Among the younger names Carville likes are Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD), and Gov.

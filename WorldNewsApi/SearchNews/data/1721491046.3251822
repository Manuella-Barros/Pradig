Under Mayor Eric Adams, the board previously voted to raise rents by 3.25% in 2022 and by 3% on new one-year leases in 2023. The compounding annual increases over three years mark a sharp contrast from board votes under Adams\u2019 predecessor. During former Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s eight years in office, the board voted three times to freeze rents and never approved an increase above 1.5%. The recent votes more closely mirror increases approved under the mayorships of Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani. The board raised rents by 2% to 5% every year from 1993 to 2013, according to annual data reviewed by Gothamist.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://images-prod.gothamist.com/original_images/IMG_3987.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators outside of the Rent Guidelines Board meeting hold signs asking for no rent raises this year.\" />\n  \n    <p>In late April, Rent Guidelines Board members agreed to consider increases of 2% to 4.5% on one-year leases.</p>\n  \n\n<p>The move by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board drew quick condemnation from tenants and their advocates as well as landlords.

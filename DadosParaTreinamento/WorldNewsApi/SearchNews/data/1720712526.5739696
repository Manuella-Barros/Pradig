According to USA Today\u2019s Christine Brennan and the Athletic, the final roster will consist of Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, A\u2019ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner, Alyssa Thomas, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd Kelsey Plum, Jackie Young, Sabrina Ionescu.

Also weighing in is Jennifer Rizzotti, president of the Connecticut Sun and WNBA Head of League Operations. Bethany Donaphin. Caitlin Clark\u2019s name being left off the roster is a shock to many. Clark received one of 14 invites to Team USA\u2019s final training camp. However, she could not attend because her college team, Iowa, was competing in the Final Four. The final roster for the women\u2019s team is veteran-heavy, with only three players making their first Olympic appearance. While many will focus on the names that are not on the roster, like Caitlin Clark. It\u2019s very debatable that she is a better guard \u2013 at this point in her career \u2013 than Diana Taurasi, Breanna Stewart, or Sabrina Ionescu. Yes, Clark would have brought in many viewers. However, basketball teams are not (or should not) built on drawing eyeballs to the screen. They should be built based on winning Olympic gold, and Team USA has won gold nine out of the last 12 times, including seven in a row dating back to 1996. Clark will get the Olympic nod many times in her career, just not yet.", "summary": "<p>Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark, who electrified college basketball with her tremendous play and has more than doubled viewership and attendance for WNBA games, will reportedly not be among the 12 players selected for the U.S. Women's Olympic basketball team.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2024/06/08/report-caitlin-clark-left-off-final-roster-for-u-s-womens-olympic-team/\">REPORT: Caitlin Clark Left Off Final Roster for U.S. Women&#8217;s Olympic Team</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2024/06/08/report-caitlin-clark-left-off-final-roster-for-u-s-womens-olympic-team/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/Catalina-Fragoso_NBAE-via-Getty-Images-4-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:12:35", "author": "Dylan Gwinn", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.151}

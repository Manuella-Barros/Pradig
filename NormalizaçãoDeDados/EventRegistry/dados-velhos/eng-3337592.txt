{"categories": [], "lang": "eng", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "id": "4", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "uri": "704258918", "body": "Jerry Jones' rise to the top as the NFL's biggest power broker and owner of the most valuable team in the world is an incredible business story. He made several bold moves in his 28 years as owner of the Dallas Cowboys, some of the most memorable being battles with the league itself in which he ultimately prevailed.\n\nNot only is he worthy of a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he'll forever have a spot in being one of the shrewdest people in sports business history. An initial investment of $118 million has turned into a franchise alone worth $4.2 billion, according to an estimate by Forbes.\n\nJones' life as an owner hasn't always been smooth, but here's a bite-sized look at some of the remarkable things he has accomplished.\n\n1. In February 1966, then-23-year-old Jerry Jones was in discussions with Barron Hilton to buy 80 percent of the San Diego Chargers for . But Jones' father, who took Modern Security Life Insurance Company's stock from $2 to $135 a share, discouraged him from doing the deal.\n\n2. Jones made his money in the oil business in Arkansas. He bought oil leases in 1982 for $15 million. After investing $35 million more in drilling and other costs, the company that sold him those leases bought out he and his partner for in 1986.\n\n3. On Feb. 25, 1989, Jerry Jones led the purchase of the Cowboys. He bought of the stadium for $65 million. He took over the Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters by assuming its $15 million of debt, included money owed in deferred contracts to players. And he bought of the team at a valuation of $60 million.\n\n4. The value of the Cowboys had gone up only $10 million in the five years since Donald Trump was given a chance to buy them for Trump passed, and said this to the New York Times in 1984: \"I feel sorry for the poor guy who is going to buy the Dallas Cowboys. It's a no-win situation for him, because if he wins, well, so what, they've won through the years. And if he loses, which seems likely because they are having troubles, he'll be known to the world as a loser.\"\n\n5. The Cowboys were in such trouble financially when Jones came to buy them that the government (FDIC) had already foreclosed on 13 percent of the team, while another 40 percent was set to be foreclosed on. Jones recently told ESPN's Adam Schefter the team was losing .\n\n6. The initial media conference to announce Jones as the new owner started , after Jones and team president Tex Schramm flew to Austin to fire long time coach Tom Landry. In Jones' first 75 days as owner, he redefined the definition of \"cleaning house.\" Landry was gone, Schramm resigned, and among those fired were team treasurer Don Wilson, the team's last original scout Gil Brandt, director of photography Bob Friedman and assistant ticket manager Ann Lloyd.\n\n7. Many other lower-level people lost their jobs because Jerry said he could do some of their jobs himself. \"Someone's got to turn off the lights in the building at night,\" Jones said in April 1989. \"If I do that, am I taking someone's job or saving money.\" The next month, Jones told a crowd at the Greater Little Rock Chamber of Commerce that one of the reasons why the Cowboys lost the most money in the league is because they had doing jobs that were doing with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n8. In June 1989, a little more than 100 days after he bought the team, Jones advocated for the Cowboys' cheerleaders to wear spandex and halter tops. , as did the team's director. \"People don't wear their hair the same way in '89 as they did in '69,\" Jones said at the time. \"People don't wear the same boots. People don't have the same feeling about what is appealing or what is exciting to our fans.\" A Dallas Times Herald poll taken at the time had only 7 percent agreeing with Jones.\n\n9. In August 1989, Jones made it a priority to have beer served in Texas Stadium. Beer was previously reserved only for places classified as a \"fine restaurant.\" It took two years, but Jones eventually won over the local politicians -- the vote was .\n\n10. In the midst of what became a 1-15 season in 1989, the Cowboys traded Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings. It became the trade that built the Cowboys' dynasty. Dallas landed a total of , including . The Cowboys used the picks it got from the Vikings to draft Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson and Russell Maryland, among others.\n\n11. Less than four years into Jones' ownership, the Cowboys won in January, 1993, beating the Bills 52-17. A year later, the Cowboys repeated as champs, beating the Bills again in\n\n12. In 1995, Jerry Jones announced team deals with Nike, Pepsi, American Express and AT&T, which were worth more than . The NFL, however, said the deals were ambush marketing because they violated revenue sharing. The league was upset in particular with Pepsi and American Express, because it had signed huge deals with competitors Coca-Cola and Visa. After Jones refused to back down, the league sued him. \"The success of the league has really been to operate as a partnership,\" NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said at the time. Jones disagreed and countersued. More than a year later, both sides dropped their claims and Jones was allowed to keep his deals.\n\n13. Amid the chaos, Jones increased his worth as a league power broker, as the Cowboys won in 1996, their third title in four seasons.\n\n14. Despite his great business savvy, Jones of course was not always liked. A November 2000 ESPN.com poll of most disliked owners had Jones at , Yankees owner George Steinbrenner at No. 2, Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder at No. 3 and Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Thrashers owner Ted Turner at No. 4.\n\n15. In , Jones opened the Cowboys Golf Club, the first and only NFL-themed golf club. The all-inclusive resort facility is located in Grapevine, Texas. That same year, Jones brought the Cowboys to training camp in Oxnard, California, to expand the team's reach. At the time, Jones said that league studies indicated that the Cowboys would win a popularity poll in every area of California except for San Diego and the Bay Area.\n\n16. The Cowboys had been known as \"America's Team\" since the 1970s, but Jones started putting it on merchandise in . He trademarked it in .\n\n17. In 2002, when the NFL did a new deal with Reebok, Jones opted out, feeling that it wasn't fair that revenues were equally split despite the fact that Cowboys contributed a disproportionate share (it reached its height in 1994 when the Cowboys generated 28 percent of all the team's licensing royalties). Going on his own, starting his own distribution system allowed him to better control the Cowboys brand. For the previous five seasons, the Cowboys made up of league merchandise. The deal that allowed Jones to go on his own, made him guarantee that back to the league and keep anything above it.\n\n18. The bet paid off, as Jones has now been on his own for . The move was more than a decade in the making. In 1994, Jones told U.S. News & World Report: \"My legacy in this league is that I'm going to be the one that unshackles the merchandise sales.\" No other owner has dared to try it.\n\n21. In 2008, Jones, the Yankees and Goldman Sachs created a hospitality company called Legends that services teams, including ticket sales. Earlier this year, a third of the business was sold off that values the business at , according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\n22. In 2009, the new Cowboys Stadium opened, with a standing-room capacity of , the largest in the NFL. \"Jerry World,\" as it has been called, also debuted the largest screen in sports, which hovers from .\n\n23. In the season opener against the New York Giants in 2012, Jones' son-in-law, Shy Anderson, was caught on camera cleaning Jerry's glasses. The team trademarked \"Jerry Wipes\" and sold a glasses cleaning cloth for Proceeds went to the Salvation Army.\n\n24. In 2013, AT&T, which first signed a three-year, $5 million deal with the team in 1996, bought naming rights to the Cowboys Stadium for at least .", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false,

Jones played college football at Arkansas where he was teammates with Jimmy Johnson, but found his real talent was in the boardroom.\n\nEven while playing football, Jones found himself drawn to the business side of the sport. After making money in the oil business, one of Jones smartest investments turned out to be the Dallas Cowboys. Jones leveraged himself to buy the Cowboys in 1989 when the team was losing money.\n\nThe Cowboys are a big reason Jones' net worth nearly doubled in the last five years. According to Forbes, Jones was worth $2.7 billion in 2012, and jumped up to his current net worth of $5.2 billion.\n\nLearn more about the business empire Jones has built.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Jones has a net worth of $5.2 billion. Jones started building his wealth through the oil business. According to Mental Floss, Jones struck oil in his first 13 wells during the 1970's. Jones did have a bit of help with the backing of his father, Pat Jones. His father sold Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions.\n\nJones has been known as one of the best salesman in sports, a trait he learned from his father's life insurance tutorials. Part of the reason he has built the Cowboys into what the franchise has become is his ability to generate partnerships with sponsors. Jones knows the value of these advertisers as D Magazine details Jones visiting a Ford assembly line to speak with employees.\n\n\"These partnership interests are something I picture like I own them as well,\" Jones told D Magazine. \"And once we sign those [contracts], then I tell them I will fly across the country to speak with their customers. I just treat 'em like I own 'em.\"\n\nThe Cowboys have become one of the most recognizable sports franchises in the world. It was not always that way, but Jones has elevated the Cowboys brand since taking over nearly 30 years ago. According to Forbes, Jones purchased the Cowboys in 1989 for $150 million. While NFL franchises had value, the NFL's popularity has skyrocketed over this time period.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the Cowboys had $190 million in player expenses, but bring in $700 million in revenue. This was $177 million more than any other NFL team. In 2016, the Cowboys became the most valuable sports franchise in the world.\n\nIn an interview on ESPN's Adam Schefter's podcast, Jones detailed the risk he took on when he purchased the Cowboys. Jones noted the Cowboys were losing $100,000 a day which added up to about $1 million a month. He was also paying 11 percent interest on a loan he took out to help purchase the team.\n\nJones detailed his early days as the Cowboys owner to Shefter (via Dallas News).\n\nThe interest alone on the investment in the club was another X-million dollars. Eleven percent interest on the amount that I borrowed. It was a bill of about almost $100,000 a day. Now that was going out the door. So when you got up in the morning, crickets get you up or whatever, whether you got up or not that was going out the door. That'll cause you to get imaginative. That'll cause you to think of some things that maybe hadn't been thought of before.\n\nI actually bought 13 percent of the Dallas Cowboys from the federal government [that] had been foreclosed on. And there was another 40 percent headed to the courthouse to be foreclosed on when I bought the team. While it was a challenge, it certainly was an opportunity. But time was of the essence. I really had to get in, get on my horse and get it rolling.\n\nWhile many fans believe Jones owns AT&T Stadium, it is owned by Arlington. According to the Star-Telegram, Jones pays $2 million in rent each year. He also pays $500,000 a year for the city's portion of the AT&T naming rights. In almost all cases, the city owns stadiums and arenas.\n\nJones may not own the stadium, but it was his vision to build one of the most luxurious stadiums in the world. Jones was first motivated by his first visit to the Astrodome decades ago to build a unique stadium. He got the idea for the massive screen that stretches from one 20 yard line to the other from a Celene Dion show in Las Vegas.\n\nJones detailed his high ambitions for the stadium to D Magazine as he wants it to \"become more familiar than the White House.\"\n\n\"It [AT&t Stadium] was designed for Al Michaels and John Madden to describe this as a 'palace for football' to the millions who are watching,\" Jones told D Magazine.\n\nThe Cowboys new practice facility, The Star, serves as the centerpiece of the mixed-used space in Frisco. According to The Dallas Morning News, the development will also include a 12,000 seat venue, office buildings, high-rise residential tower, restaurants and shopping. Jones partnered with legendary Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach on the Frisco project.\n\nJones has real estate holdings all over Texas. \"Some people think the real estate may be worth more than the franchise some day,\" Jones told D Magazine.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Jerry Jones' Net Worth: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know", "dateCrawl":

While it was originally thought that the process was taking an extended amount of time due to Elliott's domestic violence claims from last year, that apparently is not the case.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones joined the NBC crew during the Hall of Fame game between Dallas and the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night. He was asked about Elliott and stated that there is no domestic violence issue at all for Elliott, but that there are other things being looked at by the NFL, per Will Brinson of CBS Sports.\n\nAs USA TODAY pointed out, Elliott was never arrested or charged in the domestic violence case. So now the question becomes, what else is the league looking into Elliott for?\n\nIan Rapoport and Tom Pelissero of NFL.com explained a bit more of what the pending issues could be about when it comes to Elliott, which includes an incident from February 2016 and one from March of 2017.\n\nThe same woman called police on Elliott in Feb. 2016 in Florida, where the former Ohio State star was training for the NFL draft, alleging she suffered shoulder pain when Elliott pushed her up against a wall. In March 2017, Elliott was seen in videos and photos pulling down a woman's shirt and exposing her breast on the roof of a Dallas bar during an early St. Patrick's Day parade. And just this past Sunday night, Elliott's name surfaced in media reports in connection with an assault allegation at a Dallas bar.\n\nRapoport and Pelissero point out that Elliott hasn't been mentioned in the assault allegation at the Dallas bar, so it seems likely that the league may be focused more on the two other incidents. Or, maybe they're simply attempting to find out more information about the incident at the bar, simply to verify that Elliott actually wasn't involved.\n\nAs Kate Hairopoulos of The Dallas Morning News pointed out, Jones also said he believes the decision will be seen imminently.\n\nJones also continued by stating that the Cowboys are preparing for the team's Week 1 matchup against the New York Giants as though Elliott is playing, also per Hairopoulos.\n\nTime will tell, but it seems that there's a strong chance that the decision from the NFL on Elliott should be coming down sooner than later. With the season nearly a month away, you'd have to expect that this would get figured out in the coming weeks, or possibly even the next few days.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "What Is the NFL Investigating Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott For?", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15299057", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2016-02-", "textStart": 1006, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1019, "freq": 2}, {"date": "2017-03-", "textStart": 1261, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1271}], "storyUri": "eng-3327198", "time": "00:36:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "id": "181655", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "id": "198006", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "id": "219910", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302532"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302961"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "label": {"eng": "Assault"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302965"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "label": {"eng": "NBC"}, "type": "org", "id": "304114"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}, "type": "org", "id": "304254"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304977"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft", "label": {"eng": "National Football League Draft"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309406"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313823"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323676"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324224"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330672"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "type": "org", "id": "335368"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Brown", "label": {"eng": "Chris Brown"}, "type": "person", "id": "342020"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick's_Day", "label": {"eng": "Saint Patrick's Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "346625"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football", "label": {"eng": "NBC Sunday Night Football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "352689"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269795"}], "url": "https://heavy.com/sports/2017/08/ezekiel-elliott-nfl-investigation-update-domestic-violence-cowboys-jerry-jones/", "timeCrawl": "08:04:00", "image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/elliottjerryjones-e1501812962826.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T00:36:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.8117647171020508}
{"categories": [], "lang": "eng", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "id": "5195", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "uri": "704547391", "body": "Jerry Jones' rise to the top as the NFL's biggest power broker and owner of the most valuable team in the world is an incredible business story. He made several bold moves in his 28 years as owner of the Dallas Cowboys, some of the most memorable being battles with the league itself in which he ultimately prevailed.\n\nNot only is he worthy of a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame but he'll forever have a spot in being one of the shrewdest people in sports business history. An initial investment of $118 million has turned into a franchise alone worth $4.2 billion, according to an estimate by Forbes.\n\nJones' life as an owner hasn't always been smooth, but here's a bite-sized look at some of the remarkable things he has accomplished.\n\n1. In February 1966, then-23-year-old Jerry Jones was in discussions with Barron Hilton to buy 80 percent of the San Diego Chargers for . But Jones' father, who took Modern Security Life Insurance Co.'s stock from $2 to $135 a share, discouraged him from doing the deal.\n\n2. Jones made his money in the oil business in Arkansas. He bought oil leases in 1982 for $15 million. After investing $35 million more in drilling and other costs, the company that sold him those leases bought out him and his partner for in 1986.\n\n3. On Feb. 25, 1989, Jones led the purchase of the Cowboys. He bought of the stadium for $65 million. He took over the Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters by assuming its $15 million of debt, including money owed in deferred contracts to players. And he bought of the team at a valuation of $60 million.\n\n4. The value of the Cowboys had gone up only $10 million in the five years since Donald Trump was given a chance to buy them for Trump passed, and said this to The New York Times in 1984: \"I feel sorry for the poor guy who is going to buy the Dallas Cowboys. It's a no-win situation for him, because if he wins, well, so what, they've won through the years. And if he loses, which seems likely because they are having troubles, he'll be known to the world as a loser.\"\n\n5. The Cowboys were in such trouble financially when Jones came to buy them that the government (FDIC) had already foreclosed on 13 percent of the team, while another 40 percent was set to be foreclosed on. Jones recently told ESPN's Adam Schefter the team was losing .\n\n6. The initial media conference to announce Jones as the new owner started , after Jones and team president Tex Schramm flew to Austin to fire longtime coach Tom Landry. In Jones' first 75 days as owner, he redefined the definition of \"cleaning house.\" Landry was gone, Schramm resigned, and among those fired were team treasurer Don Wilson, the team's last original scout Gil Brandt, director of photography Bob Friedman and assistant ticket manager Ann Lloyd.\n\n7. Many other lower-level people lost their jobs because Jerry said he could do some of their jobs himself. \"Someone's got to turn off the lights in the building at night,\" Jones said in April 1989. \"If I do that, am I taking someone's job or saving money.\" The next month, Jones told a crowd at the Greater Little Rock Chamber of Commerce that one of the reasons the Cowboys lost the most money in the league was because they had doing jobs that were doing with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n8. In June 1989, a little more than 100 days after he bought the team, Jones advocated for the Cowboys' cheerleaders to wear spandex and halter tops. , as did the team's director. \"People don't wear their hair the same way in '89 as they did in '69,\" Jones said at the time. \"People don't wear the same boots. People don't have the same feeling about what is appealing or what is exciting to our fans.\" A Dallas Times Herald poll taken at the time had only 7 percent agreeing with Jones.\n\n9. In August 1989, Jones made it a priority to have beer served in Texas Stadium. Beer was previously reserved only for places classified as a \"fine restaurant.\" It took two years, but Jones eventually won over the local politicians -- the vote was .\n\n10. In the midst of what became a 1-15 season in 1989, the Cowboys traded Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings. It became the trade that built the Cowboys' dynasty. Dallas landed a total of , including . The Cowboys used the picks they got from the Vikings to draft Emmitt Smith, Darren Woodson and Russell Maryland, among others.\n\n11. Less than four years into Jones' ownership, the Cowboys won in January 1993, beating the Bills 52-17. A year later, the Cowboys repeated as champs, beating the Bills again in\n\n12. In 1995, Jerry Jones announced team deals with Nike, Pepsi, American Express and AT&T that were worth more than . The NFL, however, said the deals were ambush marketing because they violated revenue sharing. The league was upset in particular with Pepsi and American Express because it had signed huge deals with competitors Coca-Cola and Visa. After Jones refused to back down, the league sued him. \"The success of the league has really been to operate as a partnership,\" NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said at the time. Jones disagreed and countersued. More than a year later, both sides dropped their claims and Jones was allowed to keep his deals.\n\n13. Amid the chaos, Jones increased his worth as a league power broker, as the Cowboys won in 1996, their third title in four seasons.\n\n14. Despite his great business savvy, Jones of course was not always liked. A November 2000 ESPN.com poll of most disliked owners had Jones at , Yankees owner George Steinbrenner at No. 2, Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder at No. 3 and Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Thrashers owner Ted Turner at No. 4.\n\n15. In , Jones opened the Cowboys Golf Club, the first and only NFL-themed golf club. The all-inclusive resort facility is located in Grapevine, Texas. That same year, Jones brought the Cowboys to training camp in Oxnard, California, to expand the team's reach. At the time, Jones said that league studies indicated that the Cowboys would win a popularity poll in every area of California except for San Diego and the Bay Area.\n\n16. The Cowboys had been known as \"America's Team\" since the 1970s, but Jones started putting it on merchandise in . He trademarked it in .\n\n17. In 2002, when the NFL did a new deal with Reebok, Jones opted out, feeling that it wasn't fair that revenues were equally split despite the fact that Cowboys contributed a disproportionate share (it reached its height in 1994 when the Cowboys generated 28 percent of all the teams' licensing royalties). Going out on his own and starting his own distribution system allowed him to better control the Cowboys brand. For the previous five seasons, the Cowboys made up of league merchandise. The deal that allowed Jones to go on his own, made him guarantee that back to the league and keep anything above it.\n\n18. The bet paid off, as Jones has now been on his own for . The move was more than a decade in the making. In 1994, Jones told U.S. News & World Report: \"My legacy in this league is that I'm going to be the one that unshackles the merchandise sales.\" No other owner has dared to try it.\n\n21. In 2008, Jones, the Yankees and Goldman Sachs created a hospitality company called Legends that services teams, including ticket sales. Earlier this year, a third of the business was sold off that values the business at , according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\n22. In 2009, the new Cowboys Stadium opened, with a standing-room capacity of , the largest in the NFL. \"Jerry World,\" as it has been called, also debuted the largest screen in sports, which hovers from .\n\n23. In the season opener against the New York Giants in 2012, Jones' son-in-law, Shy Anderson, was caught on camera cleaning Jerry's glasses. The team trademarked \"Jerry Wipes\" and sold a glasses cleaning cloth for Proceeds went to the Salvation Army.\n\n24. In 2013, AT&T, which first signed a three-year, $5 million deal with the team in 1996, bought naming rights to the Cowboys Stadium for at least .", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false,

Jones, though, knows enshrinement into the Hall is usually the final chapter of the honoree's gridiron biography.\n\nThe past five owners and/or team executives selected -- Eddie DeBartolo Jr., Bill Polian, Ron Wolf, Bill Parcells and Ralph Wilson -- were no longer working in the league or distanced from day-to-day operations.\n\nMORE: How Cowboys' 2016 success made Jones a HOF lock\n\nThat isn't an accident. Hall voters (which I was, for seven years) are reticent to champion those still active on a team, or potentially so, because of how their return could impact the overall body of work already complied. Polian was so concerned about having his Hall candidacy torpedoed in 2015 that he dropped out of consideration for a top executive role with the Bills.\n\nIn this case, the Jones book isn't close to completion. The 74-year-old Jones shows no signs he will cede his roles as the franchise's president and general manager to his son Stephen or a family outsider any time soon.\n\nJones made a point of saying so when discussing the challenges of preparing his upcoming induction speech.\n\n\"The memories recapping and looking back, my remarks I wanted to include have been very enjoyable,\" Jones told co-host Gil Brandt and I last week on SiriusXM NFL Radio. \"But at the end of the day I can't say enough about what I think of the future.\n\n\"I know how lucky I am to have gotten to this point, but I really believe that my story is about what it is in the coming years.\"\n\nJones' standing in the Hall won't be affected by whatever unfolds -- heck, even O.J. Simpson remains a member -- but his legacy will be.\n\nMORE: Cowboys have a masterpiece in 'The Star'\n\nAlthough the Cowboys have won three Super Bowls since Jones became owner in 1989, the debate will always rage about who deserves the bulk of the credit for the personnel moves that made Dallas a powerhouse in the early-to-mid 1990s: Jones or coach Jimmy Johnson.\n\nJones can fully distance himself from Johnson's shadow if the Cowboys can capture another Lombardi Trophy under their current front-office configuration. While he has entrusted the Stephen Jones-led front office and coach Jason Garrett with ample responsibilities, Jones unquestionably retains final say over major decisions that have impacted the team both positively and negatively through the post-Johnson era.\n\nJones' philosophy toward some of the off-field trouble, drug suspensions and controversy involving his players remains the same as well. Simply put, someone known for having a good time himself isn't going to tell his players they can't do the same within reason.\n\nJones joked that if it isn't \"serial killing\" or \"any type of breaking the law\" than he isn't worried about a trickle-down effect on the Cowboys' performance.\n\n\"I've never, not one time in my career, seen off-the-field (behavior) and concern about it affect the play or how a player plays,\" Jones said. \"Now, I've seen it impact how we play if it reduces availability of a player, his ability to get out there. You could make a case there.\n\n\"But as far as all this off-the-field stuff, I could tell you first-hand when I played (at the University of Arkansas in the 1960s) all I could think about was that guy in front of me and my assignment and not messing it up. That's it. What was going on in the outside world or for that matter right over on the sideline was the farthest thing from my mind.\"\n\nWhether this approach has factored into the Cowboys winning only two playoff games since 1998 is debatable. What's undisputable is the main reason Jones was tapped for the Hall: his impact on how the NFL conducts its business.\n\nMORE: Jones reveals his greatest personnel move\n\nThe Cowboys were on the verge of bankruptcy when Jones purchased the team in '89. Forbes Magazine recently valued the Cowboys at an NFL-high $4 billion.\n\nJones also helped make his peers richer by providing expertise that allowed the NFL to secure monster deals from TV networks and open untapped revenue streams. Asked about what he envisions for the NFL's financial future, Jones pointed to upcoming technological changes that would impact how fans consume the product.\n\nRead More\n\n\"I've always known that only 7 percent of NFL fans have ever been inside a stadium,\" Jones said. \"The majority watch it through television. ... No one knew that the fragmentation of television -- that is going from three channels to where you might have several hundred -- would make the NFL that much more valuable, that much more substantive, that much more influential if you will.\"\n\nJones also hinted at what may be an NFL rebranding in light of the health and safety issues that have damaged football's popularity. Jones believes the progress being made toward addressing injuries will make the NFL distinguish itself in terms of promoting safety while still being the place \"where the men play\" and \"where it does get physical.\"\n\nStill, one thing that remains unchanged for Jones is his perpetual optimism about the Cowboys that surfaces at the start of every preseason. Beside the impressive talent that Dallas has assembled -- led by second-year quarterback Dak Prescott -- Jones is bullish on Garrett and his coaching staff making sure the 2017 Cowboys don't rest on their laurels after last year's 13-3 season.\n\n\"I think the success of last year and the failure of the year before have given (the coaches) insight and a lesson, whatever you want to call it, in how to maybe take advantage this year,\" Jones said. \"We've got some young players that can play and play right now. And I think we've got them in spots that we can live with as they learn.\n\n\"Now, by the way, I sure wouldn't have said that about Dak Prescott at quarterback last year. But boy, look what happened there.\"\n\nChalk that up as another reason why Jones continues to look ahead -- rather than behind -- as his Canton coronation approaches.\n\nAlex Marvez can be heard on SiriusXM NFL Radio from 3 to 6 p.m. ET Saturday at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Jerry Jones' Hall of Fame induction approaches, but the end of his Cowboys story isn't", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15469390", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "20:08:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "id": "219116", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "label": {"eng": "American football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302605"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308584"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309225"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312097"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "label": {"eng": "General manager"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321241"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garrett", "label": {"eng": "Jason Garrett"}, "type": "person", "id": "324137"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325599"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "label": {"eng": "O.

{"categories": [], "lang": "eng", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "id": "962", "title": "SB Nation"}, "uri": "704252325", "body": "Jerry Jones is a savvy businessman, the owner and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys, and above all else, he's a character. He's also about to become a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nIf there were a Hall of Fame for funny colloquialisms, Jones would also be a member. He has a tendency to talk about the Cowboys and life in the most colorful and country ways possible. Perhaps this has something to do with the way Jones' brain works. Jones, now 74, said back in 2012 that his mind is much younger than his actual physical age.\n\n\"I've been told that I have, by CT scans, that it's like the brain of a 40-year-old,\" Jones said in 2013, according to NFL.com. \" ... The guy really did not know it was me. I was there anonymously. He said, 'And so I just wanted to come down. I saw your chart. I know how old you are. That part is really impressive.'\"\n\nJones has likened Jason Garrett's performance as the head coach of the Cowboys to \"holding two handfuls of JELL-O,\" and he explained his decision to let DeMarco Murray go with an interesting metaphor.\n\n\"And I said you can't have it all,\" Jones said. \"The way you get an airplane is to drive the 5-year-old Bronco.\"\n\nThere are so many entertaining Jerry Jones sayings that we couldn't possibly include them all. But in honor of his Hall of Fame induction, here are a few of our favorite categories of Jerry Jones-isms.\n\nJones sure can turn a phrase, but he's also up for the occasional dad joke.\n\nThat's what he resorted to during a conversation with Michael Irvin's agent, Steve Endicott, about renegotiating Irvin's contract.\n\n\"Jerry says to me, 'Steve, you know that town out in West Texas, El Paso?'\" Endicott recalls Jones saying of his proposal. '\"Well, I think we're going to El Paso on that.'\"\n\nGrooooan.\n\nWhen he's not making dad jokes, Jones has plenty of things to say that are related to dads.\n\nMost recently, he said that the Cowboys could fix the pass rush problems the team experienced in 2016 by adding some \"war daddies\" on defense.\n\nThis sounds like a classic Jones colloquialism, but it's actually a bona fide football term, even if it's a little archaic. It was originally a military term, coined to describe a badass tanker.\n\n\"War daddies\" isn't Jones' only daddy-related quote. He called quarterback Dak Prescott \"the daddy\" after Prescott laid a stiff arm on a defender on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nPrescott seemed confused by the compliment, saying he neither has nor wants children. That probably won't stop Jerry from calling the dynamic young quarterback \"the daddy\" again in the future.\n\nSometimes Jerry's sayings refer to himself as a father figure and to a player as one of his children. This was the case when Jones discussed one of Randy Gregory's suspensions for violating the league's rules on substance abuse.\n\n\"He's our baby. He may be an ugly baby, but he's our baby,\" Jones said.\n\nJerry Jones is at his most country when he throws insect references into his colloquialisms.\n\nHe used the phrase \"circumcise a mosquito\" not once, but twice. The first time it was about the NFL lockout back in 2011, and the second time it was regarding the possibility of placing Tony Romo on injured reserve in 2016. Both times, Jones meant something along the lines of \"not getting bogged down by unnecessary details,\" we think, based on context clues.\n\nBut one of Jones' best catchphrases is definitely \"lower than a crippled cricket's ass.\" Poor Jerry was asked about injuries to Dez Bryant and Romo in consecutive weeks, and he wasn't feeling all that great about it. That phrase was probably an accurate summary of Jones' emotions about those injuries.\n\nFor the longest time, Jones resisted the siren call of smartphones. Sure, he could afford the latest and greatest. He just preferred his flip phone.\n\n\"I don't have any butt-dialing with that thing, I know that,\" Jones said.\n\nThat's not the only thing Jones has had to say about butts. He was asked if Felix Jones was an every-down back or a change-of-pace guy.\n\n\"He has one of those nice bubble butts,\" Jerry Jones replied.\n\nWe're not sure what that meant about Felix Jones' role in the Cowboys offense at the time. We're also not surprised it was Jones' answer.\n\nThe 2015 season was a rough one for Dallas, and the Cowboys' 4-12 finish presented Jones with the opportunity to say something else about butts.\n\n\"I'm looking up, on my back, and all I see is ass,\" Jones said via Jordan Raanan of NJ.com.\n\nJones' background was in the oil industry, and some terms from that field make their way into his sayings. That's what happened back in 2012 as the Cowboys kicked off training camp.\n\n\"I've been here when it was glory hole days, and I've been here when it wasn't,\" Jones said, according to ESPN's Tim MacMahon. \"Having said that, I want me some glory hole.\"\n\nWhen you think of the phrase \"glory hole,\" drilling for oil is maybe not what comes to mind. Thankfully, that's what Jones meant. That doesn't mean it's not hilarious.\n\nThis offseason, with a number of players -- including second-year phenom Ezekiel Elliott -- either serving suspensions or facing the possibility of one, Jones was descriptive about how the team will handle it.\n\n\"We're going to have to burn some wagons and float the Mississippi with some of the others,\" Jones said as training camp opened, via The Ringer's Bryan Curtis.\n\nOf course, Jones' storied Hall of Fame career wouldn't have happened if he hadn't walked into former Cowboys owner H.R. \"Bum\" Bright's office and offered him $140 million for the team.\n\nJones had a sense of urgency about it, which he communicated to Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson in typical Jerry fashion.\n\n\"But I knew if I didn't buy the Cowboys right then -- there it was -- I knew if I didn't grab that damn caboose that it was going to be gone,\" Jones said. \"And I was going to spend the rest of my life thinking about doing it.\"\n\nBut even while discussing his early hardships with the Cowboys, when the team was hemorrhaging money to the tune of about $1 million per month when Jones took over, he found ways to work some \"Jerryisms\" into the conversation.\n\nJones' children, Stephen, Charlotte, and Jerry Jr., are poised to take things over for the Cowboys when Jones does decide to call it a career. But we'll enjoy his creative expressions for as long as we can.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "The 5 best categories of Jerry Jones' weird sayings", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15350808", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "12:00:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "142091"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "id": "198006", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "id": "199444", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "id": "216558", "location": {"label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "label": {"eng": "American football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302605"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "label": {"eng": "Insect"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304496"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305436"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305608"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "type": "org", "id": "305867"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography", "label": {"eng": "X-ray computed tomography"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity", "label": {"eng": "Anonymity"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312898"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}, "type": "person", "id": "313670"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Irvin", "label": {"eng": "Michael Irvin"}, "type": "person", "id": "324136"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garrett", "label": {"eng": "Jason Garrett"}, "type": "person", "id": "324137"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325599"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant", "label": {"eng": "Dez Bryant"}, "type": "person", "id": "329180"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_(form)", "label": {"eng": "Flip (form)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "332881"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Sports", "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

He sued back.\n\nIt's just shy of 25 years since Jones startled the league with the firing of coach Jimmy Johnson after consecutive Super Bowl victory.\n\nThis was the same guy who dumped Tom Landry, the only coach the Cowboys had known in 29 years, when Jones bought the team and hired Johnson, who had no pro experience.\n\nJones turned on his former Arkansas teammate with the cryptic line for others to hear in early 1994 that the owner could find 500 coaches to lead those talent-laden Cowboys. The bitterness has slowly faded.\n\n\"I don't think there's a roller coaster big enough to say how that relationship has evolved,\" Johnson told The Associated Press. \"But I think Jerry and I have always liked one another. We've always had great respect for one another. There's never been any question about our passion or our drive, both of us.\n\n\"The main thing is, I'm really happy for Jerry. It's an honor that he really deserves.\"\n\nJones' wife, Gene Jones, will present her husband, a nod to Jones' feeling that the Hall of Fame recognition is as much about the family as it is the mark he left in turning the Cowboys into the most valuable brand in sports; Forbes magazine's most recent estimate was $4.2 billion.\n\nA big chunk of that worth comes from Jones' crown jewel, the $1.2 billion showplace that ushered in the era of 10-figure sports stadiums in the United States a decade ago.\n\nDon't ask son Stephen Jones, the executive vice president of personnel, to pick that or any other facet of Jones' legacy as the reason he's joining a list of contributors that includes the late owner Jones probably looked up to the most: Oakland's Al Davis.\n\n\"Only thing I can say is full body of work,\" Stephen Jones said. \"To me, it's five star at all levels. It's at the club level. It's at the NFL level. To me, he checks all the boxes in a double-plus way.\"\n\nJerry Jones said he thought his dream of owning an NFL team died with his pursuit of the Chargers. He had made his fortune in the oil business when H.R. \"Bum\" Bright decided to sell the Cowboys. And there were plenty of people close to Jones who questioned why he would take over a franchise that he said was losing $100,000 a day.\n\nWithin a decade, he had won three Super Bowls, pushed back with owners enough to help get a landmark TV deal that led to huge jumps in rights fees, and won the right to forge his own sponsorship deals.\n\nAll the while, his power grew in the small circle of NFL owners, culminating in his vital role a year a half ago in brokering a deal to let the St. Louis Rams move back to Los Angeles -- and get another team there with them. The Chargers moved from San Diego a year later.\n\n\"It's coincidental, possibly, that the timing of this Hall of Fame thing is coming along here about the same time that we're where we are with the league,\" Jones said. \"I feel very strongly, what I do with the league is for the Cowboys and I feel strongly that this is going to be better for every team in the league.\"\n\nCritics point to Jones' GM failures, with the Cowboys now at 22 years and counting since their last Super Bowl title. Dallas has won two playoff games since then.\n\nBut there's no dispute about his ability as a businessman translating to influence on the league, or his global star power.\n\n\"I really think it's validated his journey, in terms of what he's all about,\" Stephen Jones said. \"He's really stepped out there and had a vision for the NFL that not everybody shared.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592",

The Cowboys running back was allegedly involved in a 2016 domestic assault incident which led to the league investigating the situation for possible disciplinary action. Eliott has met with the league officials so that information could be gathered and presented to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. However, it doesn't seem like an official decision is any nearer in the coming days.\n\nOn Monday, the Bleacher Report indicated that ESPN's Adam Schefter said the league is still \"considering possible discipline\" but the NFL isn't expected to make an announcement anytime this week. That news comes after it was reported earlier in the month that the league's lengthy investigation of the alleged assault incident was \"nearing completion.\" Still, it leaves the Dallas Cowboys in limbo as they wait to hear whether or not their star running back will be sidelined for one game, several games or no games at all with the NFL regular season quickly approaching. It's unknown at this point how much Elliott will participate in the preseason, with a game coming this week.\n\nThe alleged incident was reported by a woman who said she was Elliott's ex-girlfriend and happened back in July of last year. Allegedly, Elliott assaulted the woman over several days. There were no official charges made by the Columbus City Attorney's Office in this incident because the District Attorney felt there were conflicting stories involved. The NFL still has the right to punish players under the league's personal conduct policy even if the player has not been found guilty of a crime.\n\nNFL has not made a decision on any potential Ezekiel Elliott discipline, and it is not expected to be announced this week, per source.\n\n-- Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 31, 2017\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys star met with league officials in New York within the past month to discuss the situation. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said after a training camp practice this past weekend, \"Everything's in place to make a decision.\" Per an ESPN report, multiple sources have said that Elliott could face a one or two-game suspension at most if the league decides to hand out a punishment.\n\nAs a rookie with the team last season, Ezekiel Elliott racked up 1,631 yards and 15 touchdowns on 322 carries in 15 games. The All-Pro Running Back was an instrumental part of a team that also included rookie quarterback Dak Prescott and made a run to the NFL Playoffs as the top seed in the National Football Conference. Expectations are high for the team once again this coming NFL season, as the two young stars embark on their sophomore seasons.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys participate in the NFL Hall of Fame Game this Thursday night against the Arizona Cardinals as a precursor to the NFL preseason. They begin their regular season on Sunday, September 10th against the New York Giants at AT&T Stadium. As of this report, the game was listed on the sports books as a \"pick\" situation by Vegas Insider, although at least one book had Dallas as a one-point favorite to win.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592",

However, there's a dark cloud surrounding last year's leading rusher Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nThere's been an ongoing 13-month investigation concerning the former Ohio State standout for assault allegations. The alleged victim claims she was Elliott's girlfriend and had lived with him. Elliott has denied both claims.\n\nThe alleged victim accused Elliott of assault on two different occasions, with the first coming in February of 2016 in Florida. The second incident occurred last July in Columbus, Ohio. Recently the team has been hopeful a decision could come soon, however, that doesn't appear as if that will be the case.\n\nWith the regular season right around the corner, Jerry Jones is hopeful NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell comes up with a decision sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I certainly don't have any idea what day,\" Jones said Saturday. \"But I know that the investigation and all the work there is, I would say is, pretty complete or they wouldn't have had a hearing.\"\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, Goodell will gather as much information as possible before making any decision.\n\n\"So where we stand is Commissioner Goodell is waiting for the opinions of those expert advisers to be done, for them to complete their work, let the NFL know what they think. Until that work is done, until they make it known to the NFL what they believe should be done in this case, there will be no decision.\"\n\nElliott is not facing criminal charges, however, the NFL can discipline players without legal charges being filed. At this point, all Cowboys fans can do is play the waiting game along with the rest of the football world.\n\nThe Cowboys regular season opener comes against the New York Giants on Sunday, Sept. 2.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-07-31", "title": "NFL Rumors: Ezekiel Elliott decision not expected this week", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-01", "id": "14671947", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1964, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1971, "date": "2017-09-02"}], "storyUri": "eng-3327198", "time": "22:25:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "id": "181655", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "id": "194057", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "id": "219116", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "id": "219910", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}, "type": "org", "id": "311040"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313823"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314202"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_Game", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314211"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}, "type": "person", "id": "325075"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "337440"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269795"}], "url": "https://fansided.com/2017/07/31/nfl-rumors-ezekiel-elliott-decision-not-expected-week/", "timeCrawl": "15:36:00", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/07/631764584-divisional-round-green-bay-packers-v-dallas-cowboys.jpg.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-07-31T22:25:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562}

Jones' mother, Arminta, would have Jerry -- or \"Little Pat,\" as his father's friends called him -- wear a bow tie and greet customers. Arminta would give Jerry a wink if she knew one of the customers was a good tipper. He would carry their basket around, help the person shop and carry their bags out of the store in hopes of landing some spare change.\n\nTo draw more people to the store, Jones' father had a highly rated radio show broadcast from there on occasion and even held amateur talent contests. Little Pat took it all in.\n\n\"They passed a blue law in the city. Blue law meant you couldn't stay open on Sunday. The only way you could stay open on Sunday is if you were a Seventh-day Adventist and you closed on Saturday,\" Jones said. \"Well, Dad went to the Adventist church and he closed on Saturday and opened on Sunday. Became very controversial but it was a way to make it work. I'm serious. I'm serious. Well, you grew up basically figuring ways to be different and get to where you want to go.\"\n\nHow long did his father remain a Seventh-day Adventist?\n\n\"Until they did away with the blue law,\" Jones said with a laugh.\n\nNo wonder Jones can sell like no other.\n\nNo owner has changed the NFL's business model more than Jones, but his Hall of Fame r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is complete because of his team's three Super Bowl wins. He didn't change religions, but he challenged the status quo. He fought owners willing to give a rebate back to the television networks in the early 1990s and helped sell a TV deal that now is considered the best in sports.\n\nHe fought the NFL by signing Texas Stadium sponsorship deals with competitors of league partners. It forced teams to market better, to grow the pie, as he likes to say. The Cowboys are the most valuable sports franchise in the world at $4.2 billion, according to Forbes. When he bought the Cowboys in 1989, Jones said, the team was losing $1 million a month.\n\nDonald Trump looked at purchasing the Cowboys and passed. Billionaire Richard Rainwater looked at the team as well and said no. When Jones looked at the Cowboys' books, he had concerns. Friends and business associates told Jones to pass.\n\n\"You go down the list, there's a lot of people that had looked at the Dallas Cowboys and said it was a piece of you-know-what financially,\" Jones said. \"And it was. And what was rough, when you looked at the game, you looked at the league -- it had gone three straight negotiations over a period of six or seven years where the rights fees were flat. There were no increases over a period of seven or eight years. I'm talking about for the whole league.\"\n\nSince Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker knocked on the hotel room door the day before Super Bowl LI in Houston to inform Jones of his selection, Jones has been thinking about his past.\n\nIn 1966, Jones, then 23 and working in insurance with his father, wanted to buy the AFL's San Diego Chargers for $5.8 million. His dad told him no. He admits he would have \"been over my skis,\" but all he ever wanted to do was get into pro football.\n\nBy the time the Cowboys came on the market, \"I thought it really passed me by, my dream,\" Jones said.\n\nOn Feb. 25, 1989, Jones agreed to spend $140 million to purchase the Cowboys and Texas Stadium. There hasn't been a day off since.\n\nThe firing of Tom Landry. The 1-15 record in 1989. The drafting of the Triplets: Michael Irvin, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith. The three Super Bowl wins in a four-year span in the '90s. The split with Jimmy Johnson. The hiring of Barry Switzer. The staggering depths of three straight 5-11 seasons from 2000-02. The hiring of Bill Parcells. The luck of finding Tony Romo as an undrafted free agent. The building of AT&T Stadium at a cost of $2.1 billion during one of the worst economic downturns in American history.\n\nSaturday night, Jerry Jones stands with the greatest in pro football history.\n\n\"It starts with his father. It's just in him, he's not going to accept failure,\" his son, Stephen Jones, said. \"One of his sayings: If you're willing to work hard enough at something, you can always make a bad deal an OK deal. But if you're really willing to work really hard on a good deal, then it becomes a great deal.\n\n\"Forty feet in the ground at AT&T [Stadium], I never saw him, [he] never gave me the impression we had a huge problem. Looking back, we had a bigger problem than I understood,\" Stephen said, referring to the state of the economy at the time the stadium was being built. \"He's always been optimistic, and he's that way, he has a unique way about him.\"\n\nJerry turns 75 in October. The Cowboys have gone 21 years without a Super Bowl appearance, but expectations this season are as high as they've been in years. Just as he lucked into Romo, he lucked into Dak Prescott, a fourth-round pick in 2016. The Cowboys have a roster on the rise.\n\n\"We need to win,\" Jones said. \"We need to continue to build on this foundation, this base that we've got right now. We can't rest on our laurels as a team. I, for sure, can't rest on any laurels in my position. And so that when I look at the opportunities ahead in the future, not only for the team but for the NFL, I see a brighter future than I did 29 years ago and I want to be a part of it.\"\n\nAs he makes his speech Saturday night, hundreds of family and friends, teammates and business associates, will be in the audience. His wife, Gene, will serve as his presenter. His children, Stephen, Charlotte and Jerry Jr., will be watching proudly. His nine grandchildren will be there as well.\n\nPat and Arminta will be there too -- in Jones' mind and in his heart.\n\n\"They should have thrown me back had I not amounted to something,\" Jones said. \"I had some great coaching from family. That's the way you live.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "From Little Pat with a bow tie to Hall of Fame: Jerry Jones' roots carry him to Canton",

Nothing is anticipated in terms of a decision on Zeke Elliott this week, still anticipated, Andrew, before the season, which of course is something the Dallas Cowboys are hoping will happen.\"\n\nThe NFL has conducted a year-long investigation into multiple incidents involving Elliott, including a domestic violence accusation made against him by a woman identifying herself as his former girlfriend to authorities.\n\nElliott, 22, has denied the domestic violence accusations.\n\nElliott is entering his second NFL season with the Cowboys after rushing for 1,631 yards and 15 touchdowns en route to earning first-team All-Pro honors as a rookie.

It's been my experience that when players have that type of attention, create that type of dynamic, they learn. They'll hit that hot stove two or three times, but then they'll quit touching. Hopefully, and I think that's been the case. Zeke is exceptionally intelligent. He's obviously a great player, and I can't emphasize enough how hard he works.

And the team's hopes to take things a step further this season, reaching - and perhaps winning - a Super Bowl, are pinned to the belief that Prescott and Elliott are built-to-last superstars who will provide a suitably spectacular Year 2 encore.\n\nSo what happens if the Cowboys are forced to open the season without Elliott?\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott, left, and running back Ezekiel Elliott helped the Cowboys thrive during their rookie season in Dallas. The duo is seen as the key to Dallas contending for a Super Bowl, but Elliott could be suspended to start the season. Associated Press/Michael Owen Baker Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nIt is an unsavory question for the franchise, given owner Jerry Jones' contention that Elliott should not be suspended by the NFL under its personal conduct policy. But it is an issue with which the Cowboys potentially must come to grips.\n\nJones said Saturday at the team's training camp that Elliott had met with league officials within the past month as part of the NFL's investigative process. That means, according to Jones, that \"everything is in place\" for the league to make a disciplinary decision about Elliott, who has been under investigation since an incident last year involving his then-girlfriend.\n\nElliott did not face criminal charges but still could be disciplined by the league. ESPN reported in recent weeks that Elliott and his representatives are braced for a suspension of possibly one to two games.\n\nThe New England Patriots won the Super Bowl last season despite playing without quarterback Tom Brady for the first four games of the regular season while he served his Deflategate suspension. The Patriots went 3-1 in those games, success that bolstered the value of backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and reinforced the X's-and-O's wizardry of Coach Bill Belichick and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. Belichick and McDaniels found a way to get one victory with rookie Jacoby Brissett at quarterback after Garoppolo was hurt.\n\nFor the Cowboys to thrive without Elliott, a greater burden would fall on Prescott and on the team's defense. The team's powerful offensive line would have to play its part in keeping the running game productive without Elliott, who led the NFL in rushing last season as a rookie.\n\nThe Cowboys' first two games of the regular season are at home against the New York Giants and at Denver. Both ranked in the top 10 last season in total defense.\n\nDallas added veteran running back Ronnie Hillman to the roster last week and already had Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris.\n\nMcFadden has had two 1,000-yard rushing seasons, one for the Raiders in 2010 and one for the Cowboys in 2015. Morris had three straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons for Washington between 2012 and 2014.\n\n\"I think we've got depth at the running back position,\" said Stephen Jones, the Cowboys' executive vice president and one of Jerry Jones' sons. \"McFadden rushed for (more than 1,000) yards . . . the year before we had Zeke. Then, of course, we have Alfred Morris as well who's a proven 1,000-yard rusher. And then you just look to what's surrounding, the supporting cast around that running back position.\n\n\"We've got, we think, obviously one of the top, if not the top, offensive lines in the game. We've got a really solid receiving corps with Dez (Bryant) and Cole (Beasley) and Terrance (Williams), with some good depth in behind that. You look at an all-pro, Hall of Famer like Jason Witten who's going to be in that huddle. I just feel very confident that if there is a suspension - we hope there's not - that we'll certainly be able to, to use a Bill Parcells term, hold the fort and be successful with or without Zeke.\"\n\nMorris said over the weekend that nothing has changed about the training camp approach of the Cowboys' other running backs because of the uncertainty over Elliott's playing status.\n\n\"I think it's the same,\" Morris said. \"We're veterans. We're mature guys. Our mindset is always like we're starters. We're one play away from being a starter. You never know what's going to happen in this business. You always prepare. We always approach every day as if we're the guy. I feel regardless of what's going on, it doesn't affect how we approach every day.\"\n\nMorris signed with the Cowboys before last season but was an afterthought in Dallas. The former workhorse for Washington had only 69 carries for the Cowboys.\n\n\"The way it started the beginning of the year, it ended up totally different,\" Morris said. \"The last few games, I was inactive. The playoff game, I was inactive, which in my career I never thought I would be inactive. But things happen. You've just got to roll with the punches.\n\n\"I don't know what my role will look like this year. \"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

That article is headlined, Cowboys Jerry Jones to Players: \"Stand For the Anthem or You're Off the Team\".\n\nBut as Politifact notes, Jones didn't say that. Jones said he supports the flag and the Cowboys as an organization support the flag, but he didn't say that kneeling for the national anthem would get a player cut.\n\nFrankly, that should be obvious: What Jones cares most about is winning football games, and he's not going to cut a good player just because he disagrees with that player's form of protest. The idea that Dak Prescott would get cut if he kneeled for the anthem is preposterous.

He sat at lunch with Smith, Lawrence Taylor and Eric Dickerson. Jones had been to the luncheon one time before when he served as Irvin's presenter, but the rules have changed to where Hall of Famers and the inductees are the only ones welcome.\n\n\"You had the opportunity to hear from these former players, coaches and contributors and also talk about a lot of players that have been in the room and not here anymore,\" Jones said. \"I had Charles Haley, Emmitt and Michael Irvin get up and talk about some of our experiences together and frankly kind of welcome me to the Hall of Fame. That will go right there as one of my great memories.\n\n\"It just feels almost unfair to have spent almost 30 years in the NFL and had as much fun as I had with the players and have as many great experiences and still get to be part of something like this.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, Jones saw the Cowboys beat the Arizona Cardinals in the Hall of Fame Game. He said it was special to \"grab that Witten and grab that Dez,\" referring to his interaction with tight end Jason Witten and wide receiver Dez Bryant before kickoff as he walked onto the field following his introduction to the crowd.\n\n\"Not a lot of GMing\" went on as he watched the game Thursday night, Jones said, referring to his role as owner and general manager.\n\nFriday night, Jones will be presented with his gold jacket for the first time. As he took off his blue blazer before meeting the media earlier in the day, he joked that he hoped they had a gold jacket left for him in the evening.\n\nAfter the dinner, Jones will hold a private party for nearly 1,000 people. His entire family will be there. So will friends from his time at Arkansas and throughout his life. The Cowboys players will be on hand, and Jones invited his fellow Hall of Fame class members. At Saturday's induction ceremony, he figures there will be 600 to 700 in attendance with direct ties to him.\n\n\"Well, the idea of wanting to demonstrate or show just how much it meant to me and our family for me to get to go into the Hall of Fame, I think will be clearly evidenced by the party tonight,\" Jones said, \"I'm not going to disappoint.\"\n\nHe hopes to have slept at least a few hours before he has to take part in an early-morning parade in downtown Canton.\n\n\"They've given me the last car,\" Jones said. \"You know, I need to be in the Hall of Fame over enjoying yourself. Don't you know that?\"\n\nOn Thursday, Jones saw his team win a preseason game. On Friday, he was welcomed by the Hall of Famers. On Saturday, he will take his place with them forever, becoming the 16th coach, executive or player to earn enshrinement based on accomplishments with the Cowboys.\n\n\"This is so substantive to me,\" Jones said. \"I have experienced some wonderful things right here with the very best.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Hall of Fame reality hitting Jerry Jones", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15461420", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "22:38:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "id": "179943", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "id": "219116", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310130"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312020"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313823"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_Game", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314211"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Irvin", "label": {"eng": "Michael Irvin"}, "type": "person", "id": "324136"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325599"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant", "label": {"eng": "Dez Bryant"}, "type": "person", "id": "329180"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Witten", "label": {"eng": "Jason Witten"}, "type": "person", "id": "394412"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dickerson", "label": {"eng": "Eric Dickerson"}, "type": "person", "id": "416346"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Haley", "label": {"eng": "Charles Haley"}, "type": "person", "id": "429922"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Taylor", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Taylor"}, "type": "person", "id": "438912"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmitt_Smith", "label": {"eng": "Emmitt Smith"}, "type": "person", "id": "483444"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Nitschke", "label": {"eng": "Ray Nitschke"}, "type": "person", "id": "515830"}], "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4761074", "timeCrawl": "22:38:00", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0804%2Fr240038_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T22:38:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6941176652908325}

Right after that show was a show called Dallas, but it was on a 10 pm which was past my bedtime. My dad would let me watch the intro to the show (watch here) just so I could see the aerial view of Texas Stadium. Yeah, I was weird like that.\n\nDespite having a cool title, the show Dallas didn't really capture my attention. I wasn't old enough to understand that grownup drama, however, I did know one thing - it was about a rich oil tycoon (J.R. Ewing) and that people wanted to shoot him.\n\nSo it seemed only fitting that in 1989, wealthy oil man, Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys. And just like J.R., it didn't take long for people to start hating him.\n\nRight out of the gate, Jones fired Cowboys legend Tom Landry. He replaced him with his college buddy who was a hot-headed, no-nonsense, college national champion coach named Jimmy Johnson. The two Arkansas guys turned around and traded away the team's best player, Herschel Walker. The team would finish 1-15 during the first year under new management and Cowboys fans were up in arms. What type of madness was going on in Dallas?\n\nWell, as we quickly learned, the team got better and it got better fast. Just three short years after their one-win season, the Cowboys would be Super Bowl champions. They would win three Super Bowls in a span of four years. It was amazing.\n\nAs great as it was, the Jerry/Jimmy marriage ended after their second Super Bowl. Just when Jones had everyone liking him, he had to go and mess it up. And to make matters worse, he brought in another friend, Barry Switzer, to run the team. Switzer was terrible. He had no control over the team. When star player Deion Sanders refused to watch film or participate in the team's weight training regimen, he just whipped out his checkbook and paid the fines.\n\nWhen Mike Woicik, the team's gruff strength and conditioning coach, complained about Sanders' indifference, Switzer sided with his new star. \"We're talking about Deion Sanders here,\" Switzer told Woicik. \"If he doesn't want to do something, he doesn't have to.\"\n\nCan you imagine what impression that left for younger players nowhere near as talented as Sanders? What would Jason Garrett do if Dez Bryant tried to pull something like that?\n\nIf there ever was a \"puppet\" coaching the Cowboys, it was Switzer. But that's how Jerry wanted it. With success happening so fast for him in Dallas, winning seemed to come easy. But it wasn't. And Jerry would learn that over the course of the next 20 plus years. The Cowboys have not made it out of the divisional round of the playoffs since their last Super Bowl victory during the 1995 season.\n\nWin or lose, Jones did things on his terms. He would make bold moves. The decision to replace Landry with Johnson was a great one, but many thereafter were not. His general manager skills hit a terrible stretch. He traded premium draft stock for wide receivers Joey Galloway (two first-rounders) and Roy Williams (a first and third). The Cowboys spend many years whiffing on draft picks (i.e. Shante Carver, Bobby Carpenter). And Jones would always sideswipe the salary cap by back-loading deals, mortgaging the team's future for success now. It was a recipe for disaster, but he always believed he was just one player away from a championship and would roll the dice as he tried to take a shortcut. These dice rolls crapped out.\n\nWhat was telling about Jones when it came to the success of the team on the football field, is that he was only as good as the people around him. Fortunately for Jerry, he was relentless in his effort to be the best. Say what you want about his methods, the guy is always trying. And throughout the years, Jones himself has succumbed to others around him that he feels can lead him back to victory. It's no longer about the ego. He just wants to win.\n\nJones isn't just an owner that sits in the booth watching things go on around him. He's personally connected with the team and that will never change. Future Hall of Famer, Jason Witten had this to say about him:\n\n\"The guy can be anywhere in the world and he chooses to be here with us and invested into what we're trying to build, and that's what we fall in love with.\"\n\nJones is often vilified by fans outside of Dallas. In 2003, he was voted the most disliked sports figure according to a poll from Sports Illustrated. Part of that just comes with the territory of being associated with the Cowboys, but Jerry exacerbates this by his own outspoken ways. He's rich, he's cocky at times, and he's always meddling. And whether their play warrants it or not, he always has the Cowboys in the limelight.\n\nWhile three Super Bowls is plenty for any owner to hang his hat on, Jones contribution extends far past what the team does on the football field. Love him or hate him, Jones' contribution to the league are prolific. He took a stand on television rights for broadcasting NFL games that ultimately led the emergence of FOX network joining the party.\n\nRecognizing the value that is the product of the Dallas Cowboys, Jones would balk at the idea of revenue sharing. During the mid '90s success, he struck deals with Nike, Pepsi, and AT&T worth more than $60 million. The commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, stated that the success of the league has come from the ability to operate as a partnership. The league sued Jones, but Jerry fired back with a counter suit. When the dust settled, Jones kept his deals.\n\nHe believed in himself when he built his $1.2 billion football stadium, known as \"Jerry's World\" that would seat over 100,000 people and generate ridiculous revenue, not just for Cowboys games, but other big-time events as well.

He immediately made his mark on the NFL by assembling a dynasty during the 1990s that was able to win 3 Super Bowl titles. Jones would solidify the Cowboys as \"America's team\" during that time frame. He had players like Deion \"Primetime\" Sanders, Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, and Michael Irvin on his payroll and all of those guys would go on to be inducted into the NFL #Hall of Fame.\n\nJones has been known to be a very generous and lenient boss to his current and former players. Most of them do nothing but praise him for the things he's done for them on and off the field when they're asked how they view him.\n\nThursday, starting wide receiver Dez Bryant spoke to a crowd of reporters at training camp about his feelings about his boss being inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\"When people counted me out he counted me in. With that alone, he showed me how much love he had for me. He gave me an opportunity to show who I am, and I will forever respect him for that. He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. There's no owner, nobody on this earth better than Jerry Jones.\"\n\n.@DezBryant on Jerry Jones going into the @ProFootballHOF: \"When others counted me out, (Jerry) counted me in.\" @NBCDFW pic.twitter.com/58w3T0nDYG -- Pat Doney (@PatDoneyNBC5)\n\nJuly 31, 2017\n\nAfter being an owner for almost 30 seasons now, Jerry Jones will be officially inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame this coming Saturday.\n\nJones took a $140 million investment in the Cowboys and turned them into a billion dollar organization. The worth of the Boys makes them the most valuable sports team in 2017 with a value of $4.2 billion. He uses the the assets of the team to improve the franchise all-around.\n\nIn one week Jerry Jones will become the 15th NFL owner to be inducted into the @ProFootballHOF #CountdownToCanton pic.twitter.com/mDIECK4W3Q -- Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys)\n\nJuly 29, 2017\n\nIn 2009, Dallas introduced their current AT&T Stadium, which Jones spent $1.3 billion on to provide fans with the best game experience around the league. The most unique feature that the stadium included is its humungous Jumbotron television that is reportedly the largest in the world. On opening night that season, the franchise set a league record when 105,121 fans showed up for the game against the New York Giants.\n\nThe move proved to be a wise one for Jones as the AT&T Stadium has hosted many big events over the last eight years.\n\nThe recent investments Jerry has made in the team seem to be paying off and has seemingly helped change the atmosphere in the locker room. Last season, his Cowboys went 13-3 and had two rookies in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott that were MVP candidates the entire year. Jerry may have had to face a lot of adversity throughout his career for not punishing his players accordingly, but his actions and efforts have been enough to land him a spot in the NFL Hall of Fame.\n\nBig HOF weekend for Jerry Jones.

The day before the always entertaining 74-year-old Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager is inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he met the media while in rare form, encapsulating his NFL experience as only he can.\n\nAnd what a long, strange trip it has been for Jones, who has played almost every role an owner can play in the league that drives professional sports in America like none other: three-time Super Bowl champion, bottom-of-the-barrel loser, running punch line, visionary, pace-setter and ultimately, a survivor who has taken one of the most iconic and recognizable brands in history and greatly enhanced its stature and value.\n\nNever one to side-step a question or render himself speechless, Jones has been in his element this Hall of Fame weekend, basking in his career-capping honor and reflecting on how he got here, on the doorstep of the game's history. He was elected from the \"contributor\" category, and oh, how Jones has undeniably contributed to everything he has ever deemed to take part in. When Jones is involved, you know it, and everyone in the vicinity knows it. For better or worse.\n\nHere are highlights of his wide-ranging 30-minute session in the Pro Football Hall of Fame media center on Friday afternoon, where he covered as much ground as any Cowboys playmaker he's ever paid, discussing everything from Ezekiel Elliott's potential league discipline, to his thoughts on old pal/nemesis Jimmy Johnson, to the size and scope of his epic Friday night Hall of Fame party. Jones is most definitely ready for his close-up on the game's grandest stage.\n\nQ: What does the Hall of Fame enshrinement mean to you now that you're on the brink of it?\n\nA: \"It's the inclusion factor, being in such a limited group. This NFL covers so many generations, so many years. It's just getting to be included in what the Hall of Fame is about. The best thing I've done so far is go to this Ray Nitschke luncheon (today) with all the returning Hall of Famers. Listening to the players I've presented talk about me, it really was an emotional thing. It just reminded me what happens with this game. You bond with your relationships more so than you do in any other discipline I've ever been in, business or anything. For me, (it's) religion.\"\n\nQ: Can you share some of the themes that will be in your induction speech?\n\nA: \"There's no question it's going to come across, how much I love this game, and how much I have benefitted from our game. From the NFL and being a part of the Dallas Cowboys. It's elevated me. As most people here know, I've had a lot of fun for 30 years. A lot of fun.\"\n\nQ: Any memories from when you first joined the league as the Cowboys owner in 1989?\n\nA: \"I'll never forget I was talking to (fellow NFL owners) and Bud Adams of the Houston Oilers at the time came up after the meeting was over with and he said, 'Jerry, I don't think I understood a word you said. But as excited as you are about it, I want some of it. I'm in.' That's kind of the way I think of things. But what (the other owners) didn't hear was that legal pad full of all the times I tried (some new idea) and got it shoved up my you know what.\"\n\nQ: Former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson is here as the Hall of Fame presenter for Miami defensive end Jason Taylor. Have you gotten a chance to visit with Johnson here?\n\nA: \"I did. It was great to see him. I had a visit with Jimmy right before the Ray Nitschke Luncheon. I certainly feel that this wouldn't have been possible, the Hall of Fame, for me had he not initially been the coach of the Cowboys. As you know, we've been knowing each other since he was 17 or 18 and I was 18 or 19. So we've spent a long time (together) and I'm particularly thrilled that he's here. We'll get to hear some of the things I've got to say about him (Saturday night).\"\n\nQ: Are you anticipating a league suspension for running back Ezekiel Elliott for any of his actions?\n\nA: \"No. No, I'm not. I don't want to basically be too, let's say, proactive about how I feel, because that's not going to make any difference here at all (in the eyes of the league). What I don't want to do is hurt things by how I feel. But I think when you look at everything that I'm aware of, then I'm not anticipating a suspension.\"\n\nQ: Have you thought about your father much this weekend (J.W. \"Pat\" Jones)?\n\nA: \"Dad's constantly a part of my life. I get dressed in the morning and I have visits with him - (Jones pauses as his voice catches and emotion gathers in his eyes) - with different pictures of periods of times in his life. And they change them out for me, so I get to visit with him quite a bit.\n\nHe had tremendous marketing skills. He was an entrepreneur. He didn't take the risks that I have taken, he did not. But he put me to shame as a salesman, really he could. And certainly when you have someone who has your best interests at heart, as a parent, that's a precious asset, and I used it to the fare-thee-well.\n\nHe called me about 10 days after I bought the Cowboys and he really couldn't believe it. He really didn't have that close grasp of what that would entail, what the commitment might be and just what the Cowboys were worth. He called me on the phone and he said, 'Jerry, I've never see anything like this. This is the damnedest visible thing I've ever seen.' And he said, 'Whether you are successful, whether you use mirror to look like it's successful, whether you use smoke or mirrors, you're a young man. You've got to make this look successful or you're going to be known as a loser all over the damn world for the rest of your life.'\n\nI said 'Well, dad, you know how to make my day.' \"\n\nQ: What has it been like getting the chance to work with your own three children, Stephen, Jerry and Charlotte, in owning the Cowboys?\n\nA: \"You get to go through those ups and downs together, but at the end of the day that family is who's going to be standing at the end of the bed. And if you had a chance to spend all of your work time, which in my case is most of my time, and you got to spend it with your family, that's quite a blessing. And I've gotten to do that, and that singularly is the best thing being in the NFL has been about for me.\"\n\nQ: You've always liked to do things on a large scale and make a big spectacle. So what's your party going to be like tonight?\n\nA: \"Well the idea of wanting to demonstrate or show just how much it meant to me and my family to get to go into the Hall of Fame, I think it'll be fully evidenced by the party tonight. I'm not going to disappoint, I know that.\"\n\nQ: Will it be bigger than ex-49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo's Hall of Fame party last year?\n\nA: \"No, I'm going to come in second behind Eddie every time.\"\n\nQ: Will you go straight from your party to the Hall of Fame parade (which starts at 8 A.M. Saturday)?\n\nA: \"Well they've given me the last car. I don't even have to start until it's over for many. It's good to be the last car.\"\n\nQ: Between friends, family and members of the franchise, how many people are here for you and your induction this weekend?\n\nA: \"Do I get to count all the Cowboys fans? Thousands... No, seriously.

He knew Ezekiel Elliott had a touchdown.\n\nLining up in the backfield during red zone drills Sunday, Elliott circled out of the backfield and used his speed and a Bryant rub to get a step or two on linebacker Damien Wilson. Dak Prescott floated a perfect pass 2 yards deep into the end zone and Elliott secured the score.\n\nIt was that easy.\n\nElliott, who has not spoken since the start of training camp, has been the subject of many articles nonetheless. Most have been about a potential suspension for an alleged domestic-violence incident last summer and an incident in which a source said Elliott was involved at a Dallas bar before the Cowboys left for training camp. Some of it has been about Elliott's follow-up to a rookie season in which he led the NFL in rushing with 1,631 yards and ran for 15 touchdowns.\n\nVery little has been written about what Elliott can do for the Cowboys out of the backfield as a pass-catcher.\n\nAs a rookie, Elliott caught 32 passes for 363 yards and had an 83-yard touchdown on a screen pass in the win against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThose are good but not great numbers. In his final two seasons with the Cowboys, DeMarco Murray had more than 50 catches both times, including 57 with offensive coordinator Scott Linehan calling the plays. When Linehan was calling plays for the Detroit Lions, running backs Reggie Bush and Joique Bell had 54 and 53 catches in the 2013 season, respectively.\n\nGetting the ball to Elliott will remain the focus of the Cowboys' offense in 2017. But it might come in different ways.\n\n\"Zeke can get more catches this year without him playing more plays,\" Prescott said. \"I think just his ability with the ball in his hands is valuable to this offense. So in the passing game [if] the defense is giving us soft coverage, get it to him and let him do what's best. As you see, we've kind of given it to him a bunch out here already. And it's just the fact of that's just how the offense is going, that's what the defense is giving us. It's not that we're calling plays extra to give Zeke the ball.\"\n\nSo far in training camp, Elliott has lined up in the slot. He has lined up wide. He has started in the backfield and motioned to the slot as well as out wide. He has run routes from the backfield.\n\n\"The game has become so specialized,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"There's a lot of different personnel substitution that happens really every down, but if you have a guy who you can leave in there for three downs and he can affect the game by running it, affect the game in protection, and then you can throw him the ball, those guys are pretty rare and they're difference-making because you can do a lot of different things with the personnel group and attacking the defense. You can be a power running team, an outside running team, and then you can spread the formation out and throw him the ball -- that's hard for a defense, challenging for them to decide how they want to match up from a personnel standpoint and the defenses they want to play.\"\n\nA year ago, Elliott played 716 of 1,060 snaps. He did not play in the regular-season finale because the Cowboys had clinched the best record in the NFC. He touched the ball on nearly half of his snaps (322 carries, 32 catches).\n\n\"I thought we had a really good plan for him last year as far as the amount of plays we wanted him in there for, and then we had certain times where we scripted in times where other backs were in the game so it wasn't going to be too much,\" Linehan said. \"We always remind ourselves it's not a sprint ... [but] when it's all said and done, we want him in the game, and there's not really a down where we wouldn't want him in the game.\"\n\nFor Prescott, Elliott is another secure outlet with Cole Beasley, Jason Witten and Bryant. The more he has the ball, the better it is for Prescott.\n\n\"He's a running back. They're the best people on this team with the ball in their hand, that's why they're the running back\" Prescott said. \"That's why it's important for us to give him the ball. Not only is it just calling run plays to have the ball, but as well as give him the ball in space, and now he's on the secondary, guys that don't want to tackle him or guys that aren't too well at tackling him.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-01", "title": "Cowboys plan to diversify way Ezekiel Elliott gets involved in offense", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-01", "id": "14622131", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3327198", "time": "11:55:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302611"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305439"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305794"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305800"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309400"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "310129"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312092"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garrett", "label": {"eng": "Jason Garrett"}, "type": "person", "id": "324137"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324223"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324224"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant", "label": {"eng": "Dez Bryant"}, "type": "person", "id": "329180"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330905"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass", "label": {"eng": "Forward pass"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345076"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_pass", "label": {"eng": "Shovel pass"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "365460"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Bush", "label": {"eng": "Reggie Bush"}, "type": "person", "id": "366587"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarco_Murray", "label": {"eng": "DeMarco Murray"}, "type": "person", "id": "379162"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Witten", "label": {"eng": "Jason Witten"}, "type": "person", "id": "394412"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Linehan", "label": {"eng": "Scott Linehan"}, "type": "person", "id": "415785"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Beasley", "label": {"eng": "Cole Beasley"}, "type": "person", "id": "554299"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joique_Bell", "label": {"eng": "Joique Bell"}, "type": "person", "id": "587836"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}, "type": "person", "id": "1269445"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_American_football_positions#Offensive_backfield", "label": {"eng": "Back (American football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269718"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269795"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Wilson", "label": {"eng": "Damien Wilson"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1351675"}], "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/76970", "timeCrawl": "11:55:00", "image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F1113%2Fr151765_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-01T11:55:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6549019813537598}

I was doing this checkup, the brain scan, and the doctor said I had the brain of a 30-year-old,\" Jones said, before being reminded he said 40 in the initial story.\n\n\"Yeah, but we always round down,\" Jones continued with a smile.\n\n\"But the whole point is, energy-wise, effort-wise and everything, and the time that we've spent this spring and all of that, gosh, it's been as good as I've had in the last five years.\"\n\nJones not only feels the best he has in a while, but he is doing more than he ever has and has more influence in NFL than any time since buying the team in 1989.\n\nJoining Jones in the Class of 2017 are players Kenny Easley, Jason Taylor, Morten Andersen, Terrell Davis, LaDainian Tomlinson and Kurt Warner. Jones will be inducted as a contributor.\n\nThe Hall of Fame might be the final resting place for players in terms of their NFL careers. But for Jones, it's a tip of the cap for a job well done.\n\nHe turned a $140 million investment in a franchise going broke in 1989 into the richest in all of sports today with a value of $4.2 billion. He also won three Super Bowls and went from renegade owner to the so-called de facto commissioner.\n\nHe is energized to do even more.\n\n\"I think that I'm doing the best I've done, right now, relative to the league. I really do,\" Jones said. \"... I've really got a lot of energy, spent a lot of time. This is the most ground I've covered since I've owned the team, in terms of activity.\"\n\nThat activity includes influencing the owners to approve the move of the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles and their stadium deal at Hollywood Park, which in term forced the San Diego Chargers to follow when they ultimately decided to move to Los Angeles.\n\nHe helped broker the move of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas with his company, Legends Hospitality, doing the sales, marketing, and food services -- just as it is in Los Angeles, with the San Francisco 49ers new stadium in Santa Clara and the new stadium the Atlanta Falcons are moving into this season.\n\nThat gives Jones influence over five other franchises in addition to the Cowboys, who set the tone for stadium building with the $1.2 billion AT&T Stadium in Arlington in 2009.\n\n\"There was never a billion-dollar stadium before AT&T Stadium,\" vice president Stephen Jones said, when asked about his father's influence. \"Now you don't see anything under $1 billion and you're seeing them go north, they're heading toward the $2 billion mark. Obviously, the one in LA, who knows where it's going to stop. But it's going to be special, as it should be.\n\n\"He certainly changed the game here. He had a huge influence in the fact that we now have the LA Rams and the LA Chargers and the Las Vegas Raiders. He's certainly a big believer in that. And I think he had a huge hand and showed a lot of leadership when it came to making some very difficult and tough decisions.\"\n\nThe NFL owners, who once fought Jones on everything, are now listening to him on everything.\n\n\"Of course it goes without saying, he was a big proponent and a big salesman at the table with the players in terms of the salary cap and putting a situation in place where people had an opportunity, owners of teams had an opportunity to really grow the pie and do well but at the same time grow the pie for the players,\" Stephen Jones said. \"He's had his hands in most aspects of the business and been on the competition committee, which is the game. It's a validation of his vision, his passion for the Dallas Cowboys and the NFL.\"\n\nIt's little wonder that 75 percent of the owners, per former Cowboys scout Gil Brandt, have already RSVP'd for Jones' Hall of Fame party on Friday night.\n\nArguably topping the list of issues Jones plans to turn his attention to in the months ahead are the league's stance on marijuana, limiting the salary of commissioner Roger Goodell and ending the practice of investigating off-field misconduct.\n\nJones raised all three issues at a closed door owners' meeting in April, per NBC Sports Pro Football Talk.\n\nJones' primary focus moving forward, however, is making the Cowboys winners again on the field.\n\nThey have not been to the Super Bowl since 1995, the last of their three titles of the 1990s.\n\nHe believes they finally have the foundation to make a legitimate run in 2017 if not years to come, thanks to the presence of quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott, both starting their second year, and the league's best offensive line.\n\nContinuing to build the NFL is in lock step with his Super Bowl objectives.\n\n\"We need to win,\" Jones said. We need to continue to build this foundation we have right now. The number one thing from this point forward is to win a Super Bowl. We can't rest on our laurels as a team. I sure can't rest on any laurels in my position.\n\n\"When I look at opportunities ahead for the future, I see a brighter future ahead for the team as well as the NFL. I see more opportunities than I did 29 years ago. I want to be a part of it. I'm going to be very active.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "After Hall induction, Jerry Jones wants 4th Super Bowl title", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15469411", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "15:08:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "id": "228323", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "label": {"eng": "American football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302605"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302733"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305872"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}, "type": "org", "id": "306256"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309225"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography", "label": {"eng": "X-ray computed tomography"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "312701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Chargers"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314210"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Raiders"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314214"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "324224"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}, "type": "person", "id": "325075"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325599"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "331327"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339167"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Brandt", "label": {"eng": "Gil Brandt"}, "type": "person", "id": "341402"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_Davis", "label": {"eng": "Terrell Davis"}, "type": "person", "id": "372663"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "375459"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Andersen", "label": {"eng": "Morten Andersen"}, "type": "person", "id": "416332"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaDainian_Tomlinson", "label": {"eng": "LaDainian Tomlinson"}, "type": "person", "id": "416348"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Warner", "label": {"eng": "Kurt Warner"}, "type": "person", "id": "429928"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Easley", "label": {"eng": "Kenny Easley"}, "type": "person", "id": "516042"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Los_Angeles_Rams", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "650475"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_St._Louis_Rams", "label": {"eng": "History of the St. Louis Rams"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "674192"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}, "type": "person", "id": "1269445"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269795"}], "url": "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article165432182.html", "timeCrawl": "23:45:00", "image": "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/pk4fyn/picture165432177/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/HOF%20JErry%20Jones(2)", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T15:08:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6431372761726379}

He sat at lunch with Smith, Lawrence Taylor and Eric Dickerson. Jones had been to the luncheon one time before when he served as Irvin's presenter, but the rules have changed to where the Hall of Famers and inductees are the only ones welcome.\n\n\"You had the opportunity to hear from these former player coaches and contributors and also talk about a lot of players that have been in the room and not here anymore,\" Jones said. \"I had Charles Haley, Emmitt and Michael Irvin get up and talk about some of our experiences together and frankly kind of welcome me to the Hall of Fame. That will go right there as one of my great memories.\n\n\"It just feels almost unfair to have spent almost 30 years in the NFL and had as much fun as I had with the players and have as many great experiences and still get to be part of something like this.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Jones saw the Cowboys beat the Arizona Cardinals in the Hall of Fame Game. He said it was special to \"grab that Witten and grab that Dez,\" referring to Jason Witten and Dez Bryant before kickoff as he walked onto the field following his introduction to the crowd.\n\n\"Not a lot of GMing,\" as he watched the game Thursday night, referring to his role as owner and general manager.\n\nTonight, Jones will be presented with his gold jacket for the first time. As he took off his blue blazer before meeting the media earlier in the day, he joked he hoped they had a gold jacket left for him tonight.\n\nAfter the dinner, Jones will hold a private party for nearly 1,000 people. His entire family will be there. So will friends from his time at Arkansas and throughout his life. The Cowboys players will be on hand, too. He invited his fellow Hall of Fame class members, too. At Saturday's induction ceremony, he figures there will be 600-700 in attendance with direct ties to him.\n\n\"Well, the idea of wanting to demonstrate or show just how much it meant to me and our family for me to get to go into the Hall of Fame, I think will be clearly evidenced by the party tonight,\" Jones said, \"I'm not going to disappoint.\"\n\nHe hopes to have slept at least a few hours before he has to take part in an early-morning parade in downtown Canton.\n\n\"They've given me the last car,\" Jones said. \" ... You know I need to be in the Hall of Fame Over Enjoying Yourself. Don't you know that?\"\n\nOn Thursday, Jones saw his team win a preseason game. On Friday, he was welcomed by the Hall of Famers. On Saturday, he will take his place with them forever, becoming the 16th coach, executive or player to earn enshrinement based on accomplishments with the Cowboys.\n\n\"This is so substantive to me,\" Jones said. \"I have experienced some wonderful things right here with the very best.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Hall of Fame reality hitting Jerry Jones", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15458707", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "22:16:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "id": "179943", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "id": "219116", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313823"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame_Game", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314211"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Irvin", "label": {"eng": "Michael Irvin"}, "type": "person", "id": "324136"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325599"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant", "label": {"eng": "Dez Bryant"}, "type": "person", "id": "329180"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Witten", "label": {"eng": "Jason Witten"}, "type": "person", "id": "394412"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dickerson", "label": {"eng": "Eric Dickerson"}, "type": "person", "id": "416346"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "422970"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Haley", "label": {"eng": "Charles Haley"}, "type": "person", "id": "429922"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Taylor", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Taylor"}, "type": "person", "id": "438912"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmitt_Smith", "label": {"eng": "Emmitt Smith"}, "type": "person", "id": "483444"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Nitschke", "label": {"eng": "Ray Nitschke"}, "type": "person", "id": "515830"}], "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/243069", "timeCrawl": "22:16:00", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0804%2Fr240038_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T22:16:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6274510025978088}

She is the wife of businessman and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and a patron of performing arts. Eugenia and Jerry Jones have been married for more than five decades and are still going strong.\n\nEugenia Jones is more than just a billionaire's wife. She has a life of her own and tremendous accomplishments to her credit. She has been married to multi-billionaire Jerry Jones for more than five decades. Jerry Jones is a businessman who is best known as the owner, president, and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys. Eugenia Jones is not only on the board of several prestigious companies, she is also well known for her philanthropic activities. She is a firm believer that social service is a moral obligation of every able person with resources to spare. Today, Eugenia Jones is known as a lot more than just Jerry Jones' wife. Here are some details from Eugenia Jones' wiki.\n\nBorn in 1944 in the United States, Eugenia Jones' age is 73. There is not much information about her early life, and no details about her educational background, except that she was interested in social service from a young age. She got married to businessman Jerry Jones on January 19, 1963, and they have been together ever since. According to sources, they have had a happily married life, and love to spend time with their three children.\n\nJones has three children from her marriage with Jerry: Stephen, Charlotte, and Jerry Jones Jr. Stephen is the CEO and executive vice-president of the Dallas Cowboys' player personnel while Charlotte is the team's executive vice-president and chief brand officer. Jerry Jr. is the chief sales and marketing officer of the team. Considering the fact that their father owns the team, it looks like running the Dallas Cowboys has pretty much become a family affair. There is no information about Eugenia Jones' net worth, but her husband 's net worth is a huge $5.2 billion. However, Eugenia uses her wealth carefully and pragmatically to help causes that are near and dear to her like the performing arts.\n\nEugenia Jones worked as a member of the Board of Directors for the AT&T Center for Performing Arts and the Texas Cultural Trust Board. She also played a major role in the creation of the Dallas Cowboys Art Collection at the AT&T stadium. Jones was also a co-chairman of the Meadows School of the Arts. Not many people know that Jones also donated to a trust fund that helps needy medical students. With all these philanthropic activities to help the less fortunate, it is no surprise that Jones is admired and respected by those who know her, and whose lives she's helped.\n\nEugenia's marriage to Jerry has been going strong for over five decades and has weathered several storms. In 2014, two photos of Jerry enjoying the company of younger girls, later revealed to be strippers, were leaked and had people talking. He spoke to the media and said that the photos were misrepresented by a third party. There was no public reaction from his wife about this incident, and their marriage does not seem to be affected by this bad press. As the Dallas Cowboys continue their winning ways, Eugenia Jones is working hard to support her family and make this world a better place.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Eugenia Jones Wiki: 5 Facts to Know about Jerry Jones' Wife", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15360929", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 1295, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1305}], "storyUri": "eng-3337592", "time": "09:59:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "id": "199444", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303392"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium", "label": {"eng": "Stadium"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303933"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313997"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Center", "label": {"eng": "AT&T Center"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "612320"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones,_Jr.", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones, Jr."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1432074"}], "url": "https://www.earnthenecklace.com/jerry-jones-wife-eugenia-jones-wiki-age-instagram-net-worth-facts/", "timeCrawl": "13:11:00", "image": "https://www.earnthenecklace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Eugenia-Jones-Wiki.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T09:59:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.615686297416687}

He's already made it clear, multiple times over, that he believes Elliott did not commit domestic violence. So Jones will be unhappy with any decision that Elliott did commit domestic violence, and any suspension that flows from it.\n\nOf course, the league's decision to kick the can another week into August won't ensure silence from Jones.

Why? Because owner Jerry Jones is one of the seven people being inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nLike the other inductees, Jones was interview by Al Michael and Cris Collinsworth during the game. He touched on the team's secondary, on former Cowboys quarterback and current CBS analyst Tony Romo (Jerry said the biggest regret of his career was never managing to put a good enough team around Romo to win a Super Bowl with him), on Tex Schramm and Tom Landry, and more. Of course, he also talked about Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nElliott is still being investigated by the NFL because of alleged incidents of domestic violence that took place last year. Jerry has maintained throughout the investigation that there is nothing there, and he repeated that sentiment Thursday night.\n\nJerry seemed pretty confident that Zeke would be available for Week 1 against the Giants, stating several times that he hopes to have the star running back on the field and that the team would be preparing as if he will play in that game.\n\nHe didn't specify which \"other things\" he was referring to in that first quote excerpted above, but we know Elliott was in a parade and pulled down a woman's shirt while on the top of a float, was clocked going 100 miles an hour in his car, and may or may not have been involved in an altercation at a Dallas bar. It's unknown at this point how -- or whether -- those incidents will affect the NFL's decision-making when it comes to a possible suspension for Elliott.\n\nJerry also noted that he thinks a decision on Elliott will be coming soon.\n\nInterested observes (including yours truly) have floated the theory that the only reason the league has not announced a decision yet is because Jones is being inducted this weekend and the NFL doesn't want him being asked about it when he's in Canton.\n\nThat's not a decision being made to protect Jerry, of course. Everyone knows he'll talk about anything at any time. (He just talked about it during the game anyway.) It's that the league doesn't want its most powerful owner taking shots at them when he is being given football's highest honor.

Wide receiver Shaq Evans, who signed with the team in January but was released shortly thereafter, was also suspended four games for violating the substance-abuse policy.\n\nEven though Moore's suspension came as a result of an incident while he played with the Seattle Seahawks, the Cowboys are still penalized. And Evans also counts against the policy as well, even though he is not with the team.\n\nA year ago, the Cowboys were fined $500,000 for the suspensions of Rolando McClain, Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence. McClain was initially suspended 10 games but was given an indefinite suspension during last season. Gregory's suspensions rose from four to 14 games last year, and he will also miss this season because of multiple violations of the substance abuse policy. Lawrence was suspended four games.\n\nAccording to the 2016 policy, with three players suspended, the Cowboys would be on the hook for 25 percent of the base salary the players will lose -- roughly $91,000.\n\nThree more Cowboys are possibly facing suspension: Ezekiel Elliott, Nolan Carroll and Damien Wilson. That could bring the fine to $500,000 -- the maximum, per NFL rules.\n\nWith four or more suspensions, the figure in the 2016 policy rises to 33 percent of the suspended players' applicable proportionate base salary for the games they miss.\n\nElliott is facing potential discipline for an alleged domestic violence charge made last summer by an ex-girlfriend in Columbus, Ohio.

Tears were shed. Mouths were left gapingly open, as if to say, Whaaaaat? This guy is the new Cowboys owner?\n\nAnd truth be known, as we have come to learn, at that time when this cat named Jerry Jones bought this franchise, his feet, too, were shaking in his oil-field boots, having basically taken whatever he had, and then some, to purchase the financially-failing Cowboys and the rights to play in Texas Stadium for $150 million.\n\nOnly come to find out, and didn't take long, he would become known nationwide - no check that, internationally - as a mover and a shaker.\n\nSee, as we all know, we in this life never get to moments like these - Jerry and wife Gene of 54 years, on stage Saturday night at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, lifting off the cloth covering his bust that will forever become housed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame's sacred rotunda - without a true beginning, usually most revealing that road well-traveled.\n\nThis all dawned on me the other day when someone asked me for a Jones story, and this isn't as much a story as it is asking yourself, Would you have thought back then that Jerry Jones one day 28 years later would be going into the Pro Football Hall of Fame? My answer would have been, \"Not in a million years.\"\n\nThis is one of the most amazing stories, journeys, I have witnessed in this my 42nd year in the sports media business. Especially when I think back to some of the more improbable stories that have personally crossed my path:\n\nSome Brit who became known as \"Eddie The Eagle\" teaching himself to ski jump, and there before my very eyes at the 1988 Winter Olympics wildly coming down the ramp like some downhill skier from Texas. There in that same Olympics having interviewed the Jamaican bobsled team members well before those guys competed in Calgary and had a movie made about their journey.\n\nLet's see, there was Ben Johnson testing positive for steroids in Seoul that same year. Of course, the Cowboys winning three Super Bowls in four years. Covering Major League Baseball's 50 anniversary All-Star Game in Comiskey Park, the very place I cut my teeth on baseball. Covering the playoff journey of the Chicago Bears winning their only Super Bowl. Watching the Dallas Mavericks play that seventh game of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, only to lose.\n\nWas there when the University of Miami won the national championship with Jimmy Johnson the head coach and Michael Irvin the star wide receiver. Watching Marcus Dupree play high school football in Philadelphia, Miss. Witnessing the New Orleans Saints win a playoff game under Sean Payton that 2006 season, their first full season back in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina, and then there three years later witnessing their improbable Super Bowl victory in that 2009 season.\n\nYep, could go on and on. But this Jerry Jones journey takes the cake. And here is another reason why:\n\nThey might as well play Frank Sinatra's hit song \"My Way\" when he walks to the podium Saturday night.\n\nNow, not to get to too maudlin here, but he did do it his way. In fact, he really invented the way. Maybe his greatest decision while shaking in those boots, also considered at the time going to be his biggest mistake, was to surround himself with his people. People he trusted. People with whom he had been in the oil- and gas-well trenches. Guys like Mike McCoy. George Hays. Bringing in Carol Padgett and Marylyn Love to handle his administrative duties, which by the way, no easy task. Hiring his college teammate, Jimmy Johnson, as his first head coach, and trusting him to bring in a bunch of college assistants.\n\nI'll let him go on and on with the names tomorrow night during his acceptance speech. He threatened Al Michaels at halftime during Thursday night's Hall of Fame preseason game to go 60 minutes. Warning, don't laugh.\n\nThen bringing his family along for the ride. He convinced oldest son Stephen to forget all that oil business and come learn the business of football. He convinced daughter Charlotte to forget Capitol Hill and come help daddy smooth over the rough edges he invariably created. Convinced son Jerry Jr. to bring that eventual law degree into his new business. They were all so young at the time.\n\nAnd then there is wife Gene, bringing her along for what began as a tumultuous ride through many a minefield.\n\nThey all hustled, every one of them. Saw it with my very eyes. They had to because remember, whatever fortune he had, he sunk into the Cowboys. So he really didn't care if he hurt the feelings of the old-guard owners in the league. Gosh darn it, he needed to make money, and while he didn't mind sharing profits as they did and still do in the NFL with all the teams, he thought those other teams ought to start hustling, too, to create greater revenue.\n\nThe maverick Jerry began developing partnerships with companies who weren't partners with the NFL. Sacked groceries with Kroger and then Albertsons. Drank beer with Miller and soda pops with Pepsi. Wore tennis shoes with Phil Knight and Nike. Put his money in Bank of America. Made his phone calls with AT&T. Made Ford his ride of choice.\n\nYep, upset that NFL apple cart, but in the end helped put more apples in those carts than these NFL owners ever could have imagined.\n\nOh, and will step on stage owning the richest sports franchise in the world, 4.2 billion dollars. BILLION now.\n\nAnd don't think this was easy by any means. I mean, along the way he not only ended up firing Landry, parting ways with Schramm, separating from Johnson, trading Herschel Walker and firing Barry Switzer, but had the nerve to make a four-year go with Bill Parcells as his head coach and hire Jason Garrett as his offensive coordinator with like two years of coaching experience before naming Wade Phillips his head coach and then being smart enough to listen to Garrett after naming him head coach.\n\nYou know, I first started covering the Dallas Cowboys on a fulltime basis that week after Jerry bought the team. Agreed with my sports editor at the Dallas Times Herald to do so on a temporary basis. With the revolving door at The Ranch spinning faster than one of those cartoon gizmos, I needed out. Too hectic. Too much pressure. Wanted my old general assignment job back, but was told they were eliminating that position.\n\nOK, I'll stay covering the Dallas Cowboys. And stayed and stayed and stayed, long after the Herald went out of business 26 years ago.\n\nAnd I'll be here Saturday night, watching the guy I initially butted heads with far too many times in those early days getting, uh, busted if you will, into the Hall of Fame. In some sense, his life ended up becoming my life, and that, too, wouldn't have dreamed of in a million years back in 1989.\n\nBut you know what, looking back, must have loved every minute of it.\n\nAnd tell you what, predicting that Jerry will tell you the same Saturday night, tipping his hand during the interview with Michaels, basically pointing out how life is amazing, that you can \"get a pat on the back for something you loved what you were doing.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Spagnola: What An Improbable Ride This Has Been

And if anyone knows the Dallas Cowboys cannot take anything for granted, even with such big things expected in the sophomore campaigns of quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott, it's Morris.\n\nMorris, now a backup tailback for the Cowboys, was a standout rookie for the Washington Redskins in 2012. Those Redskins had another dazzling rookie at quarterback, Robert Griffin III. Griffin was the NFL's offensive rookie of the year. Morris was a 1,600-yard rusher. The Redskins won an NFC East title, and practically everyone figured that Griffin and Morris would be the franchise's on-field cornerstones for a decade or so that would include multiple Super Bowls and all-pro selections. What could go wrong?\n\n[The Cowboys will have to rely on Alfred Morris and Darren McFadden early in the season if Ezekiel Elliott is suspended]\n\nPlenty, as it turned out. Griffin's Redskins career deteriorated quickly amid injuries, controversy and disappointing play. He's now searching for his third NFL team. Morris had two more 1,000-yard rushing seasons in Washington but signed with the Cowboys before last season and was an afterthought in Dallas. So nothing, Morris knows from experience, is guaranteed, even with players as promising as Prescott and Elliott in the fold.\n\n\"I feel like our year, we lost so many pieces the next year, free agents and that type of stuff,\" Morris said last weekend, standing on a practice field at the Cowboys' training camp. \"It wasn't the same team. It kind of was. But at the same time, it wasn't. So you can, in a sense, build. But you have to have the right pieces. You have to have the right mindset. A lot of times when you have success -- 'Okay, we're good' -- you kind of get complacent in a sense. I feel like that's when the downfall happens, when you get complacent like, 'We don't have anything to work on.' There's always something to work on. There's always room for improvement.\"\n\nMorris doesn't expect these Cowboys to come unglued.\n\n\"I feel like this team's mindset is a little different in that we're not complacent,\" he said. \"We're always working hard. Coach [Jason] Garrett pushes us to not be okay with okay. I think we have all the potential in the world to build around these young guys.\"\n\n[After Redskins chaos and a Super Bowl collapse, Kyle Shanahan is ready to fix the 49ers]\n\nThat is the prevailing wisdom, that the Cowboys will pick up where they left off last season, when Elliott led the league in rushing and Prescott went from fourth-round draft pick to prospective franchise quarterback after taking over for the injured Tony Romo.\n\n\"You've got to go prove it all over again,\" Cowboys tight end Jason Witten said. \"But it doesn't erase what you built. I'm the player that I am because I draw on my past experiences, good and bad, the successes that I've had and the adversity that I've had. It's the same for young players. It would be foolish to think that we can't build from that and learn from that. In the same sense, you've got to go do it again.\"\n\nPrescott and Elliott now must deal with raised expectations. That shouldn't be a major problem for them, according to Witten.\n\n\"Zeke had a great year,\" Witten said. \"Dak, too. They did a lot of great things. But there's a lot of things they can improve on. And that's what they're working on. When you have that approach, then it's really easy to kind of take this big picture and dial it back down into, 'My read on that. My drop on this,' and that's the maturity you have to have at a young age. And they've shown that, which as a veteran, I sure as hell appreciate it just because that approach allows you to think that good things are gonna happen.\"\n\nThe Cowboys' 2016 season ended with a curious mix of pride in what was accomplished and disappointment with how it all ended. They won the division and secured the NFC's No. 1 playoff seed. They captivated the football-watching nation, fueling the NFL's post-election recovery in television ratings. But then they lost a pulsating NFC semifinal at home to the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"We set a great foundation,\" Morris said. \"At the same time, we felt like we should have and could have pushed further than we did.\"\n\n[Maybe Jaylon Smith can be the difference-maker on defense that the Cowboys need]\n\nCowboys executive Stephen Jones said that he and his father, team owner Jerry Jones, did some post-playoff-defeat soul-searching about whether the franchise had done the right thing by sticking with Prescott after Romo recovered from his preseason back injury. They concluded, Stephen Jones said, that they'd made the proper move.\n\n\"The tough part of that is that we didn't get it done and we lost in the first [playoff game] again,\" Jones said. \"That's obviously frustrating for us. The other thing is, you always think a little bit about had you had a seasoned quarterback in there for the playoffs like Tony -- I think you pay a little bit of a price when you have a young guy. Not many young guys get it done.\n\n\"When you look who was in the final four [in last season's NFL playoffs], it was Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan and Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger. Those were the final four quarterbacks. That's a whole lot of experience sitting on the shelf there with those four guys. I know Jerry has asked himself a couple times: Did we do the right thing? But Dak was just so hot and playing so well, at the end of the day, it's sports and I think we did the right thing playing Dak.\"\n\nThere is no safety net now for Prescott, with Romo having retired and headed to the CBS broadcast booth.\n\n\"To be able to think that we've more than likely found our future in Dak, as we all know in this league, is a huge deal,\" Stephen Jones said. \"We've been through it before after Troy, the journey we took trying to find the next guy after Troy Aikman. And to think that we've been able to roll right from Tony to Dak is certainly something that's encouraging as well as settling in terms of what our future may look like.\"\n\nPrescott has spoken about the risk-vs.-reward considerations of taking more shots with passes deep down the field this season. But he also has talked about using Elliott as a receiver out of the backfield more frequently. Whatever his approach, he will have some NFL seasoning this time around.\n\n\"I've gotten more and more reps,\" Prescott said. \"I've taken way more reps than I took in training camp last year, obviously. It's been valuable to me.\"\n\nWith Elliott facing a possible suspension by the NFL under its personal conduct policy, the Cowboys might find themselves relying at the season's outset on Morris and fellow backup running back Darren McFadden. The burden on Prescott and the team's defense would increase if Elliott is out of the lineup temporarily. The progress of the partially rebuilt defense will remain an issue all season. But the offensive line remains imposing and wide receivers Dez Bryant, Cole Beasley and Terrance Williams should create considerable problems for opposing defenses.\n\nIt's not all up to Prescott and Elliott. But they are expected to lead the way.\n\n\"You can build on that,\" Morris said. \"That's not to say you will build on it. It's hard to repeat success, especially in this division. I feel like we can. We have the right pieces.\"\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nCan Jaylon Smith be the difference-maker on defense that the Cowboys need?\n\nRay Lewis advises Colin Kaepernick to play football -- and play down social activism\n\nWill playing a full season at age 40 work against Tom Brady?\n\nThe Ravens are asking their fans about signing Colin Kaepernick?

Jones has maintained all along that evidence shows Elliott was innocent of an incident that led to no arrest or charges against Elliott.\n\nBut Jones has offered that the league is considering other behavior besides the domestic violence allegation. During the offseason, Elliott exposed a woman's breast during a St. Patrick's Day celebration and was involved in an altercation at a Dallas bar.\n\nJones, however, remains steadfast that Elliott has done nothing that warrants a suspension.\n\n\"I think that anytime that you have scrutiny, then nobody's robots,\" Jones said. \"They can basically consider the entire situation, and so I wouldn't dare speculate just how the presentation to the commissioner will be couched or what will be emphasized. All I've made my comments based on is all the knowledge I have. I have everything.

It is fitting that he be inducted into the sport's hall of fame and remembered for his particular influence on the game and the NFL.\n\nIt is in that spirit that I offer a recent example of Jones's idiosyncratic way of speaking in the media, a confusing and seemingly nonsensical quote that hides a deeper, more profound meaning than is apparent in the simple words. From a Washington Post article about whether Colin Kaepernick's ongoing unemployment reveals a specific collective attitude among NFL owners towards the statements and positions and beliefs of their players -- whether the NFL is fundamentally less friendly for politically outspoken players than other professional sports leagues:\n\n\"I feel that every team in the National Football League makes every decision on players to win the ballgame,\" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Saturday. \"And so if someone is not on a team, I would say that for whatever the reason, the decision-makers on all 32 teams are trying to pick them to win. And so I accept that. And if they're not out there, that's why they're not out there.\"\n\nEvery team in the National Football League makes every decision on players to win the ballgame. That is a pretty hysterical statement from a man whose team recently waived a guy over character concerns and then watched as the tipping point of those concerns was revealed to be a case of mistaken identity, but then used media stooges to retroactively smear the player's work ethic rather than admit their mistake. It is also a baldly ridiculous thing to say about the case of a successful QB who can't find work in a league full of players who are increasingly publicly advocating for his employment.\n\nBut, because this is Jerry Jones, it would be foolish to take that statement at face value. It's an adorable Jerry-ism! Only a fool would accept the literal meaning of this sort of statement from a man as adept with twangy koans as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Like all Jerry-isms, this one hides a deeper meaning, decipherable only in the context of Jones's history as a public figure.

Walter O'Malley? Art Rooney?\n\nTry Jerry Jones.\n\nThe first three on the above list are currently deceased, which is the state football fans have often wished Jones were in. But it's time to give the devil his due.\n\nJones truly is the greatest owner ever, and Friday night showed why.\n\nIt's Hall of Fame Weekend in Canton, Ohio. Inductees usually go to dinner at the nearest Bob Evans the night before the big event.\n\nJones threw a bash for 1,500 people and hired Timberlake as emcee. It was typical JJ, who has been more entertaining than the other 31 NFL owners combined since he bought the Cowboys in 1989.\n\nJones never met a microphone he didn't love or a criminal he didn't think he could rehabilitate. That provided about 3.4 billion hours of material for media and fans.\n\nHe also turned his initial $140 million investment into the most valuable team on earth. The Cowboys are worth $4.2 billion, and Jones' business savvy revolutionized the NFL.\n\nAs shrewd and entertaining as Jones has been, what truly set him apart was his ego.\n\nJJ believed he was as good a coach and talent evaluator as he was a businessman. That led him to derail the budding dynasty built by Jimmy Johnson and cast Dallas into the playoff wilderness. Ezekiel Elliott was six months old the last time the Cowboys won a Super Bowl.\n\nSo congrats to JJ on being the rare owner who appeals to everybody.\n\nIf you love the NFL, he has been great. If you hate the Cowboys, he's been even better.\n\nStud of the week\n\n* Steph Curry, who shot two 74s in this week's tournament on the Web.com Tour. That was better than any round Tiger Woods has shot since 2013.\n\nDud of the week\n\n* FSU receiver Da'Vante Phillips, for being charged with five felonies in a check-cashing scheme. When informed of the arrest, the Cowboys moved Phillips to the top of their draft board.\n\nDud of the century\n\n* Pete Rose. As part of a defamation lawsuit, Rose was forced to admit last week that when he was 34 and married he had an affair with a 16-year-old girl.\n\nWhen your defense is, \"Hey, 16 made her legal in Ohio,\" you truly are worthy of the Slimeball Hall of Fame.\n\nRose disputed the woman's claim that she was actually 15 and other allegations he carried on with girls as young as 12. Given Rose's track record with the truth, I'd say any girl under 10 should be banned from his next autograph show.\n\nMoney madness\n\nThe futbol world was rocked last week when Paris Saint-Germain paid a $263 million transfer fee to snatch Neymar from Barcelona.\n\nNot only can he now afford to buy a last name, the move officially made Neymar more valuable than all but two MLS teams, according the 2016 Forbes franchise-value list.\n\nFor that amount of money, Paris Saint-Germain also could have bought two F-35 jet fighters, 65.9 million Big Macs or seven Ole Miss recruits.\n\nGreatest NFL chugger\n\nAs if Tom Brady doesn't have enough to gloat about, in a story celebrating Brady's 40th birthday last week, ESPN reported the Patriots QB is also the fastest beer chugger on the team. No wonder he's not even thinking about retirement.\n\nIn related news, Prince Philip retired last week at age 96. The Queen's husband said that after 22,219 public engagements since 1952, he knew it was time to retire when Prince Charles finally beat him in a beer-chugging contest last month.\n\nSmell test\n\nA 13-year-old Connecticut boy awoke to find a skunk in his bed last week. The varmint stunk up the place but was eventually shooed out of the house.\n\nThere's a Pete Rose joke in there somewhere, but I'm afraid he'll sue me for defamation of whatever character he has left.\n\nParting shots\n\n* ESPN reported that Michael Vick played his record-breaking 2002-03 season in Air Jordan basketball shoes. In related news, the Magic said they played last season in football cleats.\n\n* According to Forbes estimates, Pete Rose's word is now valued at minus-2 cents.\n\n* The New York Knicks reportedly are trying to trade Carmelo Anthony to the Patriots for a glass Tom Brady chugged beer out of.\n\n* In an attempt to quell worries he'd be a distraction, Colin Kaepernick has assured the Miami Dolphins that if they sign him he will stand for the Cuban national anthem.\n\n* Correction: Ex-coach Hugh Freeze says Ole Miss could have bought more than seven recruits with $263 million. The Sentinel regrets the error.\n\nDavid Whitley can be reached at dwhitley@orlandosentinel.com", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jerry Jones belongs

It's also the first time that two running backs have gone into the hall together since 1994.\n\nFresh off throwing a party on Friday night that was estimated to cost roughly $16 million, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is also a part of the class.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC on Thursday, Jones promised to give a 60-minute speech during his enshrinement, which doesn't sound believable until you realize we're talking about Jones here.\n\nIf you're planning on watching the ceremony from home, you can click here and check out all details you might need to know.

Elliott also found the end zone 15 times. As defenses search for a plan to slow down Elliott on the ground, the Cowboys are trying to come up with new ways to get number 21 the ball.\n\nDuring my time in Oxnard, California, Prescott found Elliott numerous times on passing plays, and even on ones where he wasn't the first option. In 2016, Elliott caught just over 30 passes for over 360 yards. But, you can look for those numbers to increase.\n\nCopyright 2017 KLTV.

It's almost uncontrollable, and so that's a challenge. That would be a challenge for anyone. He's got to learn to basically meet that challenge. It's been my experience that when players have that type of attention, create that type of dynamic, they learn.\n\n\"Zeke is exceptionally intelligent. He's obviously a great player, and I can't emphasize enough how hard he works. There's nobody who works harder than he does, and is more professional about how he gets ready to play a game.\"\n\nJones reiterated that the Cowboys are preparing as though Elliott will be available for the season opener against the New York Giants on Sept. 10.\n\nElliott, 22, has been under investigation by the league for more than a year. The investigation began after an ex-girlfriend accused Elliott of domestic violence last summer. But the Columbus, Ohio city prosecutor's office declined to go forward with charges because of inconsistencies in the victim's statements.\n\nJones has repeatedly stated the NFL has no grounds for a suspension on that matter, and did so again Thursday.\n\n\"From the domestic violence issue, there's not an issue,\" Jones said. \"I think that my hope is that Zeke is with us opening night, and I don't want to get into anything that might in any way influence negatively that decision from the league office.\"\n\nAn NFL spokesman said Thursday that a decision has not yet been made by the league regarding Elliott and a possible suspension.\n\nBut a source confirmed an ESPN report earlier this week that commissioner Roger Goodell is having an outside expert panel of four people review Elliott's situation and offer their thoughts and perspectives on the matter. Goodell will make the final decision.\n\nElliott, the fourth overall pick last season out of Ohio State, led the league in rushing with 1,631 yards and 15 touchdowns. The Cowboys are expected to utilize him even more in this year's offense.", "eventUri": "eng-3337592", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Jerry Jones: More than domestic violence could factor into Ezekiel Elliott suspension", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15265547", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1763, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1771, "date": "2017-09-10"}], "storyUri": "eng-3327198", "time": "04:11:00", "details": {"versions": "2017-08-04T00:26:00"}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "id": "194057", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "id": "198006", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "id": "219910", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "label": {"eng": "Police"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302532"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302557"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302961"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303289"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304977"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305661"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}, "type": "org", "id": "305867"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "313673"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell", "label": {"eng": "Roger Goodell"}, "type": "person", "id": "325075"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick's_Day", "label": {"eng": "Saint Patrick's Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "346625"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}, "type": "person", "id": "379859"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Game_of_the_Week", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Game of the Week"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "491360"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel_Elliott", "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel Elliott"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1269795"}], "url": "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article165372287.html", "timeCrawl": "04:11:00", "image": "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/tchujc-zeke/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/zeke", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T04:11:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0}

Getty Images Real Madrid has only recently secured the signing of the summer with the free transfer agreement for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 from Paris Saint-Germain, but the club already has its sights set on its next big acquisition, and that looks likely to be Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz. The German international won the DfB Pokal and the Bundesliga under Xabi Alonso\u2019s command this season, and MARCA claims that the Champions League winners are working to secure his arrival for the summer of 2025. Wirtz is under contract at Bayer Leverkusen until 2027, having signed a five-year extension in 2022. Managed by his representative and father, Wirtz could consider the near future the ideal time to leave his home nation and test his talents abroad. The report indicates that Real Madrid has agreed with the player to make a move for him in 2025, when his market value could be even higher, while the 21-year-old attacking midfielder has promised his current club that he will remain with the club for another 12 months. Wirtz recorded 18 goals and 20 assists in 49 games this season, while also establishing himself as a regular in Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side for the national team as Germany prepare to host the European Championship on home turf, starting in Munich against Scotland on June 14.

Having broken into the first team as a regular in 2020/21, he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear in March 2022 which ruled him out for over nine months. Since recovering from his injury, he has excelled under the Spanish coach, who arrived in October 2022, midway through Wirtz\u2019s recovery. Alonso has excelled in the dugout of the German side, leading them to their best season in history, with Wirtz at the center of their achievements. \"He is very important. Florian is a gift to me as a coach. He's a different player than the rest,\u201d coach Alonso commented on him, before addressing comparisons in style to Lionel Messi by saying, \"Messi is so good because he knows how and when to pass. It's not about always making the prettiest move but the best and smartest move. Florian can do that. That's why he's also so good.\" Real Madrid\u2019s other targets With Mbapp\u00e9 already on board, Wirtz would be an addition for 2025, which could see him act as a replacement for Luka Modri\u0107. The Croatian is expected to extend his stay at the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u for one final season this year, though he will celebrate his 39th birthday in September. The club are also looking to bolster their defensive ranks, where youngster French defender Leny Yoro has been linked alongside Bayern Munich\u2019s Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies. Having won La Liga and the Champions League, Carlo Ancelotti has limited room in which to improve his team\u2019s results than in 2023/24, but has the ambition to go further. The retirement of Toni Kroos in midfield poses a challenge to the Italian, and long-term replacements for ageing defensive stars like Nacho Fern\u00e1ndez and Dani Carvajal are becoming a higher priority.

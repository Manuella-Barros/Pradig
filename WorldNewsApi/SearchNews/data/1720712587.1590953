Former Mayor of Kilkenny, Minnesota, USA Kevin Taafe has arrived at the count centre in Lyrath Estate, where he is catching up with pal Andrew McGuinness. Cllr McGuinness - and all the rest of us - is still awaiting the result of the first count in Kilkenny City, which got under way firs thing this morning. The pair are friends many years, and Kevin and his wife are visiting Ireland until Wednesday. Mr Taafe was excited to observe the democratic process unfold Ireland-style, and he can't have been too disappointed - with a nice long count and lots of waiting around, as is tradition. Apart from today, the highlight of his trip was a visit to Croke Park yesterday to watch the Cats beat Dublin in the Leinster Final. Kilkenny, Minnesota is twinned with Kilkenny, Ireland, with the twinning pact signed in 2013. Coincidentally, the Mayor of Kilkenny (Ireland) at the time who signed the pact in 2013 was none other than Sean O'hArgain, who today is also here at the count centre awaiting the result of the first count. He is hoping to make a return to elected office, and tallies suggest he is in with a chance.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/20240609_162409-1717947700747_1717947907.jpg--kilkenny_.jpg?1717947907533\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />From Kilkenny to Kilkenny!

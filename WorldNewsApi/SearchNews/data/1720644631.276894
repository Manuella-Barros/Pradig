One example is the brain\u2019s \u201cdefault mode network\u201d (DMN), which is basically where your mind spends its time when it\u2019s not focused on specific talks. While first proposed in 2001, the existence of the DMN, which resides in a set of interconnected brain regions, was only verified using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology in 2016. Van der Kolk believes that \u201ctraumatized people in an ordinary state do not access their default mode network. That means, under ordinary conditions, they don\u2019t feel quite at home with themselves. But when they get re-exposed to their trauma, that network gets activated. And so you feel alive when you get exposed to your trauma, and you feel not alive when there is no trauma going on. So your brain gets rewired.\u201d Do male and female brains differ with respect to the DMN? A new study by researchers at Stanford University, led by Srikant Ryali, took an interesting approach to this question. They created an artificial intelligence (AI) model to examine brain scans. According to a report on the Stanford Medicine website, \u201cWhen the researchers tested the model on around 1,500 brain scans, it could almost always tell if the scan came from a woman or a man.\u201d", "summary": "A decade ago, Dutch psychiatrist Dr. Bessel van der Kolk wrote a landmark book on the neurobiology of trauma. It was called The Body Keeps the Score. You may have heard of it since it spent 245 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and has been translated into 43 languages.

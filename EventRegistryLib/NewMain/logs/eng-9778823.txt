While Chiranjeevi's are defending him, there are also those who are criticizing the actor. In this video, which has been shared numerous times online, Chiranjeevi, with his wife Surekha, is seen stepping out of a lift at the airport while being accompanied by ground personnel. Soon, a man working for IndiGo Airlines approaches Chiranjeevi for a selfie and is promptly ignored. When he still pursues the actor and stands in his way, Chiranjeevi nudges him aside and leaves.\n\nMany X (formerly known as Twitter) users were upset about Chiranjeevi not stopping for a selfie while others believed no fan is entitled to a photograph with his favorite actor.\n\nSharing the video, one Twitter user harshly wrote, \"Chiranjeevi rude behavior with fans at the airport.\" Another user justified the actor's action and said, \"The ground staff accompanying him asked the man to step aside. Isn't it wrong of him to approach a man who just took a long flight and is accompanied by his family?

The undated video features Chiranjeevi stepping out of the lift alongside his wife, Surekha. At that time, an airline employee approached him for a selfie. He was seen pushing him, for which he had been receiving flak from all quarters.\n\nIn the viral video, Chiranjeevi was first seen ignoring the airline employee who approached him. The man tries again for a photo, but Chiranjeevi pushes him away, drawing everyone's attention.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nWhile some of Chiranjeevi's fans defended him, others called him out for being rude to a staff member.\n\nHere are some comments:\n\nA few months ago, actor Nagarjuna apologised after his bodyguard pushed a specially-abled fan at the airport. The 'Manmadhudu' actor claimed that he was unaware of the incident and apologised. At the time of the incident, Dhanush and his sons were also with Nagarjuna.\n\nLater, Nagarjuna met the fan at the airport and posed for a picture outside the airport.\n\nChiranjeevi and his family members recently jetted off to Paris to attend the opening ceremony of Olympics 2024.

I think the investment that Netflix is putting into interesting filmmakers and interesting projects would be more admirable if it weren't being used as some kind of bizarre leverage against shutting down theatres. It's so pointless. I don't really get it.\"\n\nChris Nolan on the set of Dunkirk\n\nWhile Netflix insists that it isn't trying to close cinemas as it promotes its online platform, Nolan is adamant that his movies are designed to be seen on large screens as a communal experience.\n\nIndeed, Dunkirk was shot mainly in Imax, with additional 65mm footage, to make it as big as possible. And yet critics have pointed out that it's a very personal film. \"I refer to it as an intimate epic,\" Nolan says. \"That was very much my ambition for this film. To immerse the audience visually. And by contrasting multiple points of view, but each told in a disciplined way, to try and build up a larger picture of the extraordinary events at Dunkirk. You've got 400,000 men on this beach, pretty much within sight of England, the enemy closing in on all sides, faced with really the choice between surrender and annihilation. And the fact that this story does not end in either surrender or annihilation is why, for me, I think it's one of the greatest stories in human history.\"\n\nNolan's most memorable films, from Memento and Inception to the Dark Knight trilogy, all have this combination of spectacle and intimacy. \"I try to only make films that I feel very connected with on some emotional level,\" he says. \"This is the first time I've taken on a real-life event, and there's a huge responsibility that comes with that.\"\n\nIt's rare for a war-themed movie to cross over so strongly with mainstream audiences. But perhaps this has something to do with casting Harry Styles in a significant role. \"Oh, I'm very much patting myself on the back,\" Nolan laughs. \"The truth is ever since I cast Heath Ledger as the Joker and raised all kinds of eyebrows, I've recognised that this is my responsibility. I really have to spot the potential in somebody who hasn't done a particular thing before. What Harry has done in the film is truthful, and it's a very tough role he's playing too.\"\n\nWatch the trailer for Dunkirk:", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T02:29:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "contactmusic.com", "title": "Contactmusic.com", "id": "275"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:29:00", "url": "http://www.contactmusic.com/christopher-nolan/news/christopher-nolan-dunkirk_5784610", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8523062", "image": "http://www.contactmusic.com/images/feature-images/dunkirk-christopher-nolan-bts-01-700-420.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "02:29:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

watch a master stylist filmmaker doing what he does best about a war long-waged, won and lost at a time of wars scarcely chronicled, let alone comprehended in the full magnitude of their calamity?\n\nChristopher Nolan's much anticipated, and now loudly praised, war film \"Dunkirk\" (2017) was by serendipity released at a time when the battle of\u2002Mosul\u2002had just been waged and won with at heavy cost. \"The massacre of Mosul,\" the\u2002headlines were screaming,\u2002\"40,000 feared dead in battle to take back city from Isis as scale of civilian casualties revealed.\"\n\nFilm critics and filmgoers in\u2002United States, Europe, and indeed around the globe, were queuing to watch a film rendition of the\u2002World War II\u2002Battle of Dunkirk between the Allies and Nazi Germany, while we were reading the horrid accounts of how in Mosul \"many bodies are still buried under the rubble and the level of human suffering is immense\".\n\nHow do we reconcile what we read in our daily headlines with what we watch in a widely celebrated Hollywood production? What's Hecuba to Nolan, or he to Mosul, Aleppo, or\u2002Yemen?\n\n\"Dunkirk\" has been received with rave reviews. \"Christopher Nolan's WWII Epic May Be the Greatest War Film Ever,\"\u2002Rolling Stone reviewer Peter Travers\u2002put it quite bluntly, \"Filmmaker's recreation of key British battle is stunning, stirring - and a stone-cold masterpiece.\"\n\nThis type of sudden overexcitement about a film is, of course, a sign of either complete ignorance of the history of cinema and its towering masters or else a momentary insanity with no enduring consequence.\n\nThe trouble with such bombastic praise is that the genre of war films is the battlefield of some mighty filmmakers. You cannot just hire Hans Zimmer (however gifted a composer he is) to Bang & Olufsen your head in and shove a film down your throat and then Rolling Stone it \"a masterpiece\".\n\nI intentionally saw the film on the largest screen possible in New York for the full immersion experience of its sound design and music, as it was meant to be seen. That kind of acoustic arrogance and deafening pitch that numb your skull, so you would think what you are watching is a \"masterpiece\" is pure Trumpian charlatanism worthy of\u2002Anthony Scaramucci\u2002(aka Joe Pesci) expletives.\n\nThirty minutes into Nolan's \"Dunkirk\", I was texting a filmmaker friend sharing my boredom and frustration. By contrast, 60 years after its original making, Stanley Kubrick's \"Path of Glory\" (1957) still freezes me staring at my laptop screen when I review any sequence of it before sharing with my students. Obnoxiously loud music and massively oversized screen do not make for a \"masterpiece\". Eyeglasses, as we way in Persian, don't turn you into an intellectual.\n\nNolan, to be sure, is a master stylist now in his top form who has a solid record with enduring films like \"Memento\" (2000) and his signature take on his Batman trilogy - but he is no Sergey Eisenstein in \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925).\n\nNolan is a self-assured filmmaker with a solid command of his craft - but he is no Stanley Kubrick in \"Path of Glory\" (1957) or \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987).\n\nNolan is a gifted storyteller staged confidently here in his \"Dunkirk\" - but he is no Terrence Malick in \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998). Nolan stages a judicious sense of drama - but he is no Elem Klimov in \"Come and See\" (1985). Nolan has a sensual sense of the sea and sand - but he is nowhere near Wolfgang Petersen in \"Das Boot\" (1981)\n\nPlease, ladies and gentlemen film critics: Nolan has a good pair of eyes for the aesthetic of warfare - but he is no Akira Kurosawa in \"Ran\" (1985). \"The greatest war film ever?\" You need to go back to film school if you had any serious education to begin with.\n\nUltimately, Nolan's stylistic craftsmanship and the bravura finale of the story of Dunkirk itself saves Nolan's film so you exit the theatre not entirely disappointed and just with a headache from the unbearably loud music and overbearing sound design. Nolan does indeed perfectly weaves together the parallel story lines to create a mythical saga of the historic incident. But the film never transcends its myopic British nationalism to achieve anything remotely universal in its aspirations.\n\nConsider Nolan's choice of ending his film with Churchill's unabashed praise for British imperialism (put in the voice of one of his\u2002young soldiers)\u2002as the salvation of the world in his famous \"we shall not flag or fail\" speech.\n\n\"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans ... we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\"\n\nAnd compare it (for a minute) with that miraculous central sequence of Trance Malick's \"Thin Red Line\" and\u2002its poetic implosion\u2002in the voice of one of his soldiers:\n\n\"This great evil. Where does it come from? How'd it steals into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us? Robbing us of life and light. Mockin' us with the sight of what we might've known. Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed through this night?\"\n\nNolan is simply not in the same league. One sequence in Kurosawa's \"Ran\" - the violent siege in which Hidetora and his samurai are attacked by his sons Taro and Jiro's combined forces - has forever in the history of cinema defined what it means to do a war scene. That sequence uplifts the Shakespearean tragedy and medieval Japanese dynastic feuds into the stage of archetypal truth. Nolan is no Kurosawa. \"Dunkirk\" is not \"Ran\".\n\nSo no, \"Dunkirk\" is most certainly not \"the greatest war film ever\", nor indeed is it the worst. It is the best Nolan has been capable so far to do as he desperately tries to find his cinematic signature, which here is somewhere near Spielberg's equally hyped, but vacuous, \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998).\n\nBut how do we tell the difference between a Kubrick, a Kurosawa, a Malick, on one side, and a Nolan or a Spielberg on the other?\n\nKubrick, Kurosawa, or Malick were not antiquarian. They did not make a film about World War I, or set a Shakespearean tragedy in medieval Japan, or turned their attention to the Vietnam War to entertain people's historical fantasies. They went searching for the quintessence of war and turned it against itself. Their war movies were without exception antiwar movies. Directing their films, they were always fully conscious and responsive to the perilous time they lived in and the wars raging in their own times.\n\nAt the time when Nolan has turned all his cinematic wherewithal to a now obscure incident during World War II, the world is being ripped apart by other gut-wrenching wars. Who will tell the Afghan, the Iraqi, the Libyan, the Syrian, or the Yemeni stories, their battlefields and slaughterhouses?\n\nThis article has been excerpted from: 'Brown skin, white sands: Dunkirk is no Path of Glory'.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:46:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "title": "The News International", "id": "460"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:46:00", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/222840-No-path-of-glory", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8544583", "image": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNewsInternational-Opinion/~4/yQ4-R80yY5E", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Belgian and British armies and the seaborne evacuation of 338,000 troops from Dunkirk in northern France as a \"colossal military disaster\".\n\nFor a nation whose national identity is intimately bound up with victory and conquest, it is paradoxical that the retreat from Dunkirk has become such an important part of British mythology.\n\nRacist pub bore Nigel Farage tweeted \"I urge every youngster to go out and watch #Dunkirk\".\n\nHe was referring to the hugely successful new film by Christopher Nolan, in a week when discussion about Britain's next major withdrawal from Europe -- Brexit -- mainly dwelt on the wisdom of eating chickens treated with chlorine.\n\nFilms about war are inherently political. Viewing the output from British and US directors over the past few years, you would be forgiven for forming the view that the interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan are being made by honourable people doing their best to help out the benighted locals.\n\nDunkirk is political too. Its central premise is that British pluck saved the day against overwhelming odds. The director seeks to lead us to this conclusion by playing fast and loose with history, playing up to a particular British self-image and creating a superb piece of cinema.\n\nIt starts with his representations of the other combatants. Nolan avoids the standard trope of the decent German soldier who hates the Nazis by not showing the audience any Germans. In fact, they are only ever referred to as \"the enemy\".\n\nFrench troops appear three times. Briefly when they are defending the outer perimeter of Dunkirk, again when a group of them try to board a British ship and are refused, and the French character with the largest role has put on a British uniform and is trying to escape. Can't trust 'em, you see.\n\nIt is not possible to watch Dunkirk except through the prism of Brexit and the orgy of British chauvinism that made it possible. The closing scene of the film has a character reading another extract from Churchill's speech: \"If, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\"\n\nIt is essentially the Tory program for leaving the European Union. \"There are big markets in the Commonwealth and the US will bail us out.\"\n\nNolan plays up a certain notion of British, or more specifically English, patriotism. Belfast-born Kenneth Branagh channels Jack Hawkins in all those 1950s British war films. The left-leaning Mark Rylance is the civilian boat owner who keeps calm when avoiding a strafing from a German plane. Tom Hardy is the epitome of the stoic Spitfire pilot.\n\nIt is easy to see how anyone in the audience who had a parent or grandparent fight in the British army during World War II would feel a deep sense of pride watching this bloodless representation of war, and Nolan definitely milks it.\n\nNevertheless, even viewers without that personal emotional attachment will get drawn into this astounding piece of film making. From start to finish, to the accompaniment of Han Zimmer's masterful soundtrack, the tension barely relents.\n\nWe may not see the result of bullets and bombs on bodies, but we vividly experience something of what waiting for death to randomly strike was like. Nolan plays with our emotions, and no matter how politically savvy you are, you'll get goosebumps when the small boats arrive or when Rylance goes into the offices of the local newspaper.\n\nThe kinetic drama even allows you to momentarily ignore the stupidly Anglo-centric marketing slogan that it was the \"event that changed our world\".\n\nThe Battle of Stalingrad has a better claim on that. It was there that the Red Army decisively defeated the Germans. By comparison, Dunkirk was not even a sideshow.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T06:33:00Z", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "source": {"uri": "greenleft.org.au", "title": "Green Left Weekly", "id": "6183"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:33:00", "url": "https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/dunkirk-%E2%80%94-superbly-executed-nationalist-myth-making", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8550879", "image": "https://www.greenleft.org.au/sites/default/files/p25%20dunkirk.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "06:33:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

omitting the role of Indian soldiers during the Dunkirk evacuation.\n\nWhile Christopher Nolan's film has received critical acclaim in India, some media reports have questioned why the film has ignored the \"significant contribution\" of Indian soldiers in Dunkirk, reported Hollywood Reporter.\n\nDunkirk opened in India last Friday to stellar reviews and what is considered a strong box-office opening for a Hollywood film, bringing in an estimated $2.4 million. But not everyone in the country is impressed.\n\nVarious reports in leading media outlets have questioned why Christopher Nolan's movie ignored what the Times of India newspaper calls the \"significant contribution\" of Indian soldiers at Dunkirk. The article, titled \"How Nolan forgot the desis (Indians) at Dunkirk,\" notes that the omission should be seen in light of the fact that the \"British public is more well-informed today about the Indian role in the World Wars.\"\n\nIt also refers to Oxford historian Yasmin Khan's book The Raj at War, in which the author writes, \"Britain did not fight the Second World War, the British Empire did.\"\n\nInternational observers are also echoing a similar sentiment. In a column for Slate, John Broich, an associate professor of history at Case Western Reserve University, wrote that the appearance of Indian soldiers in the film \"would have provided a good reminder of how utterly central the role of the Indian Army was in the war. Their service meant the difference between victory and defeat.\"\n\nBroich, whose views have also been quoted by the Hindustan Times newspaper, points out that there were four companies of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps at Dunkirk adding that \"observers said they were particularly cool under fire and well-organized during the retreat.\"\n\nAccording to historical data, some 2.5 million soldiers from the Indian sub-continent served with the British army during World War II. But the depiction of Indian soldiers in Hollywood films revolving around the war have been few and far between. One of the most notable onscreen appearances was last seen in 1996's The English Patient, which featured British Indian actor Naveen Andrews (Sense8, Lost) in a supporting role as an Indian Sikh soldier, Kip Singh, serving in the Italian campaign of the war in the Oscar-winning film, which starred Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche.\n\nReferring to historical accounts of the war, in an article headlined \"Miracle at Dunkirk: Indians too were trapped with Allied forces,\" India Today pointed out that 1,800 Indian soldiers were tasked with transporting 2,000 mules carrying arms and ammunition to the war zone in France. Since the British army had disbanded its animal transport companies after World War I, Indian companies were brought in to transport supplies over terrain in France that wasn't accessible for cars.\n\nThe Indian contingent was designated as Force K-6 and departed from what was then called Bombay (now Mumbai), reaching Marseilles in France in December 1939. According to the Times of India, three companies of Force K-6 were evacuated to safety during Operation Dynamo, the Allied operation to extricate about 400,000 British forces from Dunkirk, which forms the backdrop of the film. However, one remaining Indian company was taken captive by the Nazis, and many of its men died in German POW camps.\n\nWhile most opinions are focusing on how the film missed out on a bit of history, the Hindustan Times' article offers somewhat of a counter view with the headline \"Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk forgot the Indian soldiers' contribution, but does it matter?\" Pointing to one scene early on in the film where a British soldier is seen refusing entry to French troops who want to board one of the boats to safety, the article says: \"Long story short -- if anyone should be outraged at their less-than-glowing depiction in the movie, it's the French.\"\n\nQuestioning whether a film \"which makes the conscious choice to exclude everyone, but the British from its narrative be held at fault for not mentioning the Indian contribution,\" the article also says that Dunkirk \"is a celebration of the bravery shown by common people. And if Indians were involved, the film, however abstract it is in its ways, pays homage to them too.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T06:07:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "thelinkpaper.ca", "title": "thelinkpaper.ca", "id": "10571"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:07:00", "url": "http://thelinkpaper.ca/?p=64439", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8750229", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "06:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The cinematography of battle is excellent. The themes of confusion, paradox, irony, and unintended consequences in war are well captured through the mostly visual daylong odyssey of \"Tommy\" (Fionn Whitehead).\n\nIn near continual silence (dialogue is scant in Dunkirk ), Tommy seems to escape one disaster only to fall into another, in his Odysseus-like effort to get across the water to home.\n\nThe evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from the beach at Dunkirk, France, 26 May to 4 June 1940. Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nThe movie also presents well the tripartite nature of the British -- and French -- resistance at Dunkirk, especially the deadly fighting above the sea between British Spitfires and German Bf109 fighters, Stuka dive bombers, and Heinkel He 111 medium bombers that so shocked the Germans, who had assumed that supposedly inferior British pilots and planes (with their fuel worries) would ensure the Luftwaffe rapid air supremacy.\n\nThere is an eerie slaughter on and below the ocean, as Royal Navy warships and British civilian craft struggle to save tens of thousands of British and French soldiers before they are blown apart by German subs and bombers.\n\nThe frenzy on the beaches, contrasted with the stiff-upper-lip cool of the British officer corps, is moving, even as the German ground troops around Dunkirk -- who are almost never seen or heard on the ground and appear wraith-like in the film -- slowly squeeze the beaten British Expeditionary Force into the last few acres of sanctuary.\n\nIn general, any time Western cinema offers up history -- as opposed to suburban psychodramas, space yarns, zombies, comic book heroes, car crashes, or evil corporate conspiracies -- we should applaud.\n\nThe heroism of the British rescue fleet, the professionalism and courage of the RAF pilots, and the defiant defeated on the beaches of Dunkirk resonate through the entire film. It is a fine and fitting thing for popular culture to remember a courageous past at a time when millions of residents and citizens in the West -- in the United Kingdom and the United States in particular -- either are ignorant of their own history or deprecate it as a melodrama of oppressive \"isms\" and \"ologies\".\n\nWatching Dunkirk should also remind contemporary Western critics that the triumph of Nazi Germany and its eventual Axis partners would have aborted the freedom, material bounty, and security that a billion people now take for granted in the West.\n\nBut all that said, a good movie could have easily become a great film. Military history, whether written or visual, requires a mixture of both strategic and tactical narrative with first-hand \"face of battle\" portrayals of those doing the actual killing and dying. Dunkirk is good on the latter count, and completely wanting on the former.\n\nEven a brief two-minute shot of a last-ditch conference between trapped British Expeditionary Force generals, or between stalled German Panzer commanders just miles away, or a conversation of grand strategy back in London between Churchill and his new cabinet, or even a few seconds of rantings of Adolf Hitler to his general staff, could have conveyed what was at stake.\n\nAnd just five minutes of that background story would have made two hours of poignant resistance all the more remarkable.\n\nThe facts are these: The \"phony war\" laxity of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain collapsed on May 10, 1940 when the Wehrmacht in complete surprise blasted through the Ardennes forest on a pathway conventionally deemed too rugged for heavy vehicles.\n\nUnlike in World War I, when allied resistance stopped the surprise German assault and ensured for four years that the Germans would never get much more than 70 miles into France, Hitler's 1940 attack on Western Europe would be wrapped up in six weeks, and the fate of the European democracies sealed within days of the invasion.\n\nIndeed, within hours, the newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill was faced with disastrous choices: either keep the fleet and the air force engaged and the army on French soil to bolster collapsing French morale and save a base in Europe for eventual counter-offensives, or pull them all out from a lost cause, and with luck just possibly save Britain from Hitler's next round of attack.\n\nChurchill chose to gamble, keeping British troops engaged as long as the fate of France was realistically in the balance -- but not long enough to forfeit the entire army, and much of the fleet and air force so necessary to stop Hitler's impending effort to bomb and blockade Britain in preparation for an invasion that supposedly would duplicate the six-week victory in France.\n\nThe fight over the beaches at Dunkirk was a prelude to the Battle of Britain -- and a warning to the Third Reich that it had at last butted up against an enemy that would neither give in nor collapse.\n\nThe ultimate irony of Dunkirk was that a previously unstoppable Blitzkrieg suddenly sputtered to an unenforced halt just miles from the Atlantic when it was on the verge of annihilating British land power and thereby perhaps ensuring, at least psychologically, a defeat of the only remaining major enemy of the Third Reich.\n\nHistorians still argue about what happened. Were German field generals exhausted after the frenzied and costly pace of the prior two weeks?\n\nOr was the stoppage of Germany's pursuit the work of the unstable Hermann Goring and his Luftwaffe that demanded a glorious coup de gr\u00e2ce, by bombing the collapsing ring of Allied soldiers to smithereens -- as a forewarning of what shortly would follow in a blitz over London?\n\nOr was the culprit the loss of nerve of the often passive-aggressive Hitler?\n\nWe forget both that, even in his lightning victories, the Fuhrer often proved tentative and fearful under stress -- and that the Wehrmacht suffered over 45,000 killed and missing, and over 100,000 wounded, in its supposedly easy walk-over of France.\n\nOr was Hitler deluded enough to believe that Churchill was representative of a suspect aristocratic class eager to make peace if it could keep its overseas Empire, as Germany swallowed the European mainland?\n\nIt is unlikely, but not impossible, that Hitler felt a terrified but relieved Britain would be eager to end the war formally if its expeditionary army was not decimated by German armor and artillery.\n\nEven after the evacuation, when the Germans in a few hours reached the French coast, the war for Europe was assumed to be won. Britain surely would concede to save its homeland from the sort of brutality unleashed on Poland and France.\n\nThe Soviet Union, after witnessing such frightening German armored advances, surely had no intention of reneging on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 that was helping to fuel and feed the Wehrmacht's conquests with Russian supplies.\n\nAs for the United States during Dunkirk -- while the Roosevelt administration was, at least on the sly, eager to replenish British exhausted armament stocks, it nonetheless had no intention of joining what was felt to be a lost cause.\n\nIndeed, the United States probably would not have declared war on Germany, even after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, had not Hitler nearly inexplicably first declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941.\n\nIn contrast, the survival of the British army at Dunkirk, and of the retiring British fleet and air force -- along with the miraculous ongoing retooling of the British munitions industry -- meant that Britain and its empire were able, well before Pearl Harbor, to muster enough manpower in a few months to stop the Italians in Eastern and Northern Africa, to save Malta, to fight the Germans in Greece, to begin bombing occupied Europe, to shortly win the air war over Britain, and to begin to check the U-boat offensive.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to critique Dunkirk 's focus on the common soldier and the near anonymous killing swirling about him. But even here, greater detail would have enhanced the film's emphases on the personal experience of battle.\n\nIn the movie, the sheer tapestry of the British rescue effort never fully unfolds. In fact, well over 800 British warships, merchant marine boats, fishing trawlers, and yachts formed a huge armada that dotted the horizon off the Dunkirk coast. Yet that vast maritime landscape is never captured by the film's portrait of a seemingly smallish private flotilla.\n\nThe film also shows the littered beaches of Dunkirk, but again the effect of the screen's occasional flotsam and jetsam is understatement. In fact, the wreckage of the British army was unimaginable.\n\nAlmost all of its artillery -- well over 2,000 field guns of various sizes -- over 60,000 wheeled vehicles, 700 tanks, and over 11,000 machine guns, were lost, much of them left scattered on the beach, a reality that again is hardly captured by the film.\n\nWhile British pluck shines through the film, the British achievement is underappreciated precisely because of the utter dearth of both strategic context and even brief portrayals of the Germans on the ground.\n\nThe expeditionary armies of the Germans in Tunisia in summer 1943 were faced with the same dilemma -- and in contrast surrendered a near similarly sized army. The Russians lost entire trapped armies on at least three occasions that were twice the size of those evacuated at Dunkirk.\n\nThe Japanese never evacuated on a similar scale any of their often-encircled expeditionary forces. The sheer audacity and skill of the British, and so early in the war, went mostly unrivaled throughout World War II -- a sort of reverse D-Day embarkation of comparable magnitude, but without the resources, planning, and four years of favorable warring and German attrition.\n\nFinally, the miracle at Dunkirk reminds us of the underappreciated but pivotal British role in World War II. We often reduce the Allied victory to the blood of Russian manpower and the treasure of American supply. And there is much truth to both those generalizations.\n\nBut spiritually, we should remind ourselves that Britain was the only major power on either side to both begin the global war on its first day and continue to fight it until its last, six years later.\n\nIt was also the only major power to fight the Third Reich alone, which it did courageously between June 25, 1940 and June 22, 1941. It was the only Allied nation to declare war on the Axis for the principled promise to an ally, Poland, rather than because it was either surprise-attacked or had war declared on it first.\n\nBritish genius gave the Allies everything from sonar to Firefly Sherman tanks to the Ultra intercepts to the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine in the superb American P-51 Mustang.\n\nIn sum, Dunkirk is an impressive postmodern glimpse of a premodern nightmare, but a view nonetheless that is without a strategic or political -- or much of any -- context. Such a landmark event is diminished to a story about any war, rather than the singular British existential struggle to stop Nazi Germany.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a Martin and Illie Anderson senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-26", "textEnd": 251, "textStart": 245, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textEnd": 4548, "textStart": 4542}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-12-", "textEnd": 8425, "textStart": 8414}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {"liCnt": 4, "pinCnt": 3}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:34:00Z", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "title": "Newsweek", "id": "14218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:34:00", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/what-really-happened-dunkirk-what-movie-missed-649214", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8867829", "image": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/08/10/gettyimages-3314594.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Imtiaz Ali devotees with Christopher Nolan fanatics, a fellow critic and I discussed the two storytellers over beer. Mentioning them in the same boozy breath might have sounded far-fetched.\n\nBut while one has built a career upon the systematic intellectualisation of convention, the other has altered the large-scale cinematic landscape by conventionalising intellectuality. Ali's hypnotic hold over a niche, existential cross-section of the country's urban millennials is vaguely similar to Nolan's grip over an elite global legion of cerebral junkies. There's an invisible pressure on both to outdo their previous films, as well as a mass tendency to celebrate their work solely in context of their own legacies.\n\nWhen Ali's latest, Jab Harry Met Sejal, was critically panned for being \"hollow, underwritten and un-Ali-like,\" his response was telling. \"My last film (Tamasha) was praised,\" he said, \"but it didn't reach many people.\" Here was a victim of his own heritage. Dissuaded by his bravest mainstream film's relative lack of commercial success, Jab Harry Met Sejal was evidently his solution -- a slow-burning reaction to economics, as opposed to his previous films, which were individually thematic reactions to his own burgeoning reputation.\n\nAt first glance, Nolan's tenth feature-length film, Dunkirk, which released two weeks before Ali's rom-com, also looks like an urgent reaction to his own legacy. It presents itself as a drastic, one-note departure from our notions of his creative stature. Over his two-decade-long career, he has inadvertently convinced a generation of cinema enthusiasts that there exists an exclusive high-functioning nation called 'Nolan-verse'. He has made low-budget, high-concept movies (The Following, Memento) and big-budget, high-concept movies about the past, present and future (The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar); his first step into studio limelight was with a small-town, atmospheric non-thriller (Insomnia); he has rebuilt a jaded superhero franchise (The Dark Knight trilogy) from bottom to top by adapting material naturally at odds with conceptual heft.\n\nAnd yet, this versatility of ambition is grouped under a singular stylistic umbrella: non-linear narratives, labyrinthine plots, Michael Caine, space-time rifts, in-script exposition, haunting Hans Zimmer music, and morally conflicted male protagonists.\n\nWhile others are accused of telling the same stories over and over again, he is accused of creating different universes that overwhelm us with the same intensity over and over again. Because, while the rest of Hollywood is action and performances and sex and blood, Nolan has become an idea.\n\nMaster storyteller\n\nHis ideas adopt frameworks ranging from the sparse to the over-crowded, from indie-impulsive to blockbuster-clinical, but at no point do they stop being thoughts. These thoughts remind independent filmmakers of why they tell stories, and mainstream filmmakers of why they should tell stories.\n\nExtending his Inception terminology, if his contemporaries are Arthur stuck in a dogged gunfight against unseen mental enemies, he has become the smug Eames, who serenely butts in with a grenade launcher and declares, \"You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.\"\n\nHe is, therefore, accused of sacrificing soul at the altar of imagination and sequence, of being too ambitious and forcing us to continuously re-examine the potential of artistic expression. Soul, however, is not an adjective but a destination in his movies; it is a non-intimate search, a subversive notion of \"home\" overshadowed by distractive story-building devices: magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) tricks our eyes to reach his motherless little daughter in The Prestige; dream-extractor Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) executes a complicated heist to re-enter America for his motherless children in Inception; and Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) escapes a dark hole to reunite with his daughter in Interstellar.\n\nWhich is why Dunkirk -- a cold, bleak, bloodless, kinetic, discomforting and near-wordless World War II snapshot -- might on the surface seem like a consequence of his reputation. Like a conscious attempt to rid his palette of all the tamasha, un-Nolanify popular perceptions, seduce the Academy and prove a Kubrick-shaped point.\n\nThe kick in the dream\n\nIn context of his bombastic filmography, Dunkirk looked like Nolan himself does in his films' official set photographs -- an old-school, out-of-place, unglamorous but elegantly dressed \"human\" with a portable video monitor around his neck, dwarfed by volcanic landscapes and customised revolving corridors, carefully observing Batman, Bane, Joker and David Bowie inflate their adventures. The antidote to world-building, the kick in dreams, the practicality in illusions.\n\nDunkirk, though, on closer look, is the filmmaker's most distilled version of his voice. It too is about a battle to get home. About sons reaching their parents, instead of the other way around. Only, the battle is literal; it's a war. And the war -- the mechanics, rules, risks and rewards with crisscrossing timelines -- is the real story. Not its soldiers. There are no characters in war, just numbers and faceless survivors. The idea of war, like most Nolan-verse concepts, is complex, man-made, close-ended and cyclical too. There are only two roles -- living and dying -- and neither of them is derived from personal disposition. The action is plotted elaborately, as opposed to the plot being elaborately explained.\n\nOn another day, the realness of the Dunkirk evacuation could assume the methodical imagination of a fictitious maze-like dreamscape, the vast technicalities of an intergalactic space mission, the cat-and-mouse rivalry of two ruthless magicians in 1890s London, or even the audaciousness of an amnesia-afflicted investigator's backward-playing narrative.\n\nDunkirk is, in fact, very much Nolan in those set photographs -- detailed, focused, instructive, and a precise reminder of lived-in truth in a world full of masked franchises and mythical legends. It is the ancestor of world-building, the kick without dreams, the rationality preceding illusions.\n\nAnd appropriately so. Because as much as we'd like to identify \"order\" to this storyteller's filmography, the fact remains that none of his work is reactionary. Each of them is based on a feeling: a wide-eyed whim independent of the era they end up defining or the cinema they end up defying.\n\nDunkirk was conceived as his first film, 20 years ago, on a boat ride with his wife across the English Channel. He made the film in 2017 because he could, not because he needed to. And certainly not because of what preceded it. The Prestige, too, was written before Insomnia and Batman Begins, while Interstellar's foundation was laid much before Inception. Those films are, in hindsight, indirect descendants of Dunkirk's vision -- of a youngster discovering, not manufacturing, magic in history.\n\nIf anything, his movies are a limit-pushing reaction to the traditionalism of genres they occupy, just like his techniques (film over digital; no phones and chairs on set; practical effects over CGI) are a reaction to the cascading modernity of the craft. None of his films are \"follow-ups\"; they exist with the kind of stubborn force that suggests there's nothing to precede or follow them. Irrespective of his language, we still believe he is repeatedly asking us: are you watching closely? The problem, of course, occurs when filmmakers watch us, and themselves, as closely. Perhaps his deliberate lack of self-awareness, an aversion to the very idea of creative fulfilment, is what sets him apart.\n\nHis 1997 short, Doodlebug, was about a paranoid man trying to kill a tiny bug-like creature across his room. The bug is later revealed to be a mini version of himself, whose movements pre-empt his own. He squashes it, which results in him being squashed by a larger version of himself. Ironically, this could well be a psychological metaphor for most filmmakers embarking upon a new production and \"building\" a career.\n\nBut Christopher Nolan isn't in that room. He likely knows that nobody cares about the man in the box.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356939", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T11:45:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "title": "The Hindu", "id": "241"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:45:00", "url": "http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-prestige-of-christopher-nolan/article19474055.ece", "storyUri": "eng-3356939", "id": "8785884", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/article19474050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13SM1inception3jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "11:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Strategically located an hour north of Calgary , Innisfail is an emerging clean energy hub. Deep Sky Labs' mission is to accelerate the path to low cost, low energy intensity and highly scalable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to produce high integrity carbon credits. The project represents an industry first for the private development of scalable CDR, the first cross-technology project in the world, and the first commercial direct air capture project in Canada .\n\nThe Deep Sky Labs site is located within 5 acres of a municipality-owned industrial park at 6015 35th Street, neighboring other proposed green projects including a solar farm and waste-to-energy plant. Engineering and design work has been conducted in partnership with leading engineering firm BB A , and construction will begin imminently. The facility will be operational this winter, and will have the capacity to capture 3,000 tons of CO2 per year, or 30,000 tons over a 10-year period, via up to 10 different technologies. It will also include room for future expansion.\n\nLabs makes it possible for many different Direct Air Capture (DAC) concepts to be tested simultaneously. Its tech-agnostic nature decreases delivery and operational risks while increasing the speed at which the industry can scale. This novel approach solves for the delivery delays that have plagued past global carbon removal projects. To start, eight state-of-the-art DAC technologies will be deployed at the facility, sitting side by side with standardized instrumentation for the collection of operational data. Here, they'll be tested and optimized for performance year-round in the Canadian climate and validated before committing to them at commercial scale. Proprietary Deep Sky software will track and benchmark all operational data to accelerate the R&D of technology partners and the industry at large - another industry first.\n\nThe eight technologies will have full access to renewable power and carbon storage, enabling a life cycle analysis to ultimately produce verified carbon removal credits validated by third-party carbon registries. These elite DAC providers include Airhive , Avnos , Phlair (formerly Carbon Atlantis), Greenlyte Carbon Technologies , Mission Zero , NEG8 Carbon , Skyrenu , and Skytree . Together, the partners represent the world's foremost CO2 carbon removal technologies, convening for the first time in Canada , the carbon removal capital of the world.\n\nLabs is purpose-built with space for 10 different DAC technologies, with room to expand. While eight world class technologies are already confirmed, Deep Sky Labs is actively seeking additional technology developers interested in piloting their direct air capture technology. Priority criteria include a pathway to low energy intensity (1,000 kWh per ton of CO2 captured or lower at scale), simplicity and focus on removing CO2 (no utilization pathways), manufacturing and scalability, and a strong team. Any DAC providers interested in deploying at Deep Sky Labs can fill out this form .\n\n\"I cannot overstate the significance of the world's first carbon removal innovation and commercialization centre, and what this means for Canada and our planet at large,\" said Damien Steel , Deep Sky CEO. \"This project represents a world first and serves as a testing ground from which the nascent industry can grow into Canada's multi-trillion-dollar enterprise. We're in the business of scaling carbon removals, and this first facility represents a giant step forward for the health of our planet and our economy. Prioritizing quality and speed, we're proud that this facility went from concept to construction in less than a year.\"\n\nThe CO2 collected at Labs will be trucked to an existing well at the Meadowbrook Carbon Storage Hub facility operated by Deep Sky's storage partner Bison Low Carbon Ventures , north of Edmonton in Sturgeon County. Bison is advancing the Meadowbrook project through the regulatory approval process and has a dedicated injection well capable of handling all Labs volume. Their Deep Sky partnership also makes Bison the first in North America to support a DAC hub.\n\nA recent survey revealed that Albertans are increasingly concerned about climate change and support technologies like carbon removal to address it. There is majority agreement that Canada should use carbon removal technology to help fight climate change in Calgary (67%) and Edmonton (57%), with more than half (51%) of those elsewhere in Alberta in agreement. A majority of Albertans (65%) want to learn more about carbon removal, while 29% would be interested in a job in the industry.\n\n\"The Town of Innisfail is thrilled to work with Deep Sky and welcomes them to our community,\" said Innisfail Mayor Jean Barclay . \"To have a company of this magnitude who is on the leading edge of carbon removal technology located in Innisfail is truly exciting for us. The selection of Innisfail by Deep Sky speaks volumes to our business readiness, our willingness to respond at a pace that is necessary in today's business environment, and our vision for a new state-of-the-art industrial park.\"\n\nDeep Sky Labs will generate high-demand green jobs in Innisfail. Approximately 80 workers will be employed for the construction phase, with another 15 for annual operations. The project has the potential to infuse more than $110M in the Innisfail community over 10 years. Subsequent commercial plants across Canada will employ approximately 1,000 workers for construction and 150 for annual operations.\n\nDeep Sky helps enterprises meet their decarbonization commitments through high integrity carbon removal credits used to offset company emissions. Carbon removal credits produced by Deep Sky projects are traced end-to-end with digital Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) and are validated against the most rigorous carbon standards to ensure complete additionality and durability. Deep Sky's projects are designed to reduce risks typically associated with carbon removals while increasing the community and economic impact of an enterprise's decarbonization budget.\n\nLabs accomplishes the first phase of this plan, allowing Deep Sky to accelerate the development of multiple technologies and scale them at commercial projects across Canada . Deep Sky Labs and future Deep Sky projects will issue carbon removal credits via carbon registries such that they meet global regulatory and industry-led carbon integrity schemes.

DAC units pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, rather than from smokestacks at industrial sites.\n\nDeep Sky has begun building what it calls the world's first carbon removal innovation and commercialization centre in the town's industrial park, and will install the first eight pilot plants from September through the end of 2025 from providers Airhive, Avnos Inc., Phlair, Greenlyte Carbon Technologies GmbH, Mission Zero Technologies, NEG8 Carbon, Skyrenu Technologies and Skytree.\n\nThe site, set to be operational by March, will be able to capture up 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide over 10 years, with the gas stored in a well north of Edmonton, Deep Sky said.\n\nThe pilot project is an environmental beauty contest to determine which units work most cost-effectively and energy-efficiently on renewable electricity in Canada's extreme climate. \"The concept and idea is it's a plug and play standardized centre,\" said Phil De Luna, Deep Sky's chief carbon scientist. \"As soon as we know that a pilot works or doesn't, we rip it out and put a new one in.\"\n\nDeep Sky's longer-term plan is to build vastly larger campuses composed of bigger versions of the units that prove to be the most efficient. \"For the first time globally someone is going to put state of the art DAC units side by side and run and test and compare them and track everything,\" Deep Sky CEO Damien Steel said.\n\nDeep Sky is also conducting prefeasibility studies in two industrial centres in Quebec to determine if the geology is suitable for large-scale underground carbon storage.\n\nA $3-million study in B\u00e9cancour, east of Montreal, is focused on land surrounding a 70-square-kilometre industrial park. Field teams have placed 18,000 acoustic detectors to measure vibrations three kilometres deep and create a 3-D ultrasound map of the geology. The study should yield results in early 2025, and Deep Sky hopes to drill up to 20 wells to store carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. The company is also conducting studies in Th\u00e9tford Mines to see if the underground geology can support a process in which carbon dioxide is converted into stone.\n\nDeep Sky has moved quickly since Mr. Lalonde incorporated it 23 months ago after deciding he wanted to do more than planting trees to offset the impact of his online travel agency. It has raised $75-millllion from Brightspark Ventures, the Quebec government, Whitecap Venture Partners, BDC Capital, Bank of Montreal and Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System.\n\nIt has also recruited a team, including Mr. Steel, ex-head of venture capital for OMERS, former Hopper chief technology officer Joost Ouwerkerk, and industry specialists including Mr. De Luna, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Toronto; Greg Maidment, who previously oversaw one of Canada's only operational underground carbon storage facilities; and Catalina S\u00e1nchez-Roa, former climate and sustainability consultant with Boston Consulting Group.\n\nBut Deep Sky faces steep odds. The carbon removal sector is still young and just a few small-scale DAC plants operate worldwide. There is no certainty the technologies Deep Sky is testing and which are now built by hand can work as larger units, or that suppliers can manufacture them efficiently at scale. \"The biggest challenge Deep Sky faces is imposing its pace on the rest of the industry where maybe the sense of urgency is not necessarily there,\" Brightspark managing partner Sophie Forest said.\n\nClimate experts caution DAC can't be used as an excuse to slow efforts to decarbonize heavy industries. However, Mr. Steel said \"we are past the point of picking and choosing; we need to do everything. Carbon removal is not the answer to the world's climate problems. But it is absolutely part of the answer.\"\n\nThe International Energy Agency in 2022 said its net-zero scenario would require an average of 32 large-scale plants to be built every year through 2050, a mammoth task that would require private and public support. It also pointed out that DAC-based carbon removal credits are currently limited to voluntary carbon markets, which have come under scrutiny following instances in which offsets have been deemed to be of poor quality or limited effectiveness.\n\nThere is demand for DAC-based offsets, though. Occidental Petroleum Corp. last year acquired B.C. DAC startup Carbon Engineering Ltd. for US$1.1-billion and has sold credits to Airbus SE, Shopify Inc., Bank of Montreal and others as it builds projects in Texas. Swiss-based Climeworks AG, which operates a demonstration DAC plant in Iceland, has also secured several big-name corporate backers.\n\nDeep Sky must convince infrastructure giants to build commercial-scale complexes, each of which could cost $1-billion, and which Mr. Steel hopes will be largely funded by governments, export credit agencies, philanthropists and lenders. The company depends on continued government green spending initiatives, which are far from guaranteed if political winds shift.\n\nDeep Sky has already had to change its plans to build its test facility in Quebec after the province moved more slowly than Alberta in adopting a carbon capture, utilization and storage investment tax credit regime established by the Ottawa. Alberta will also help the company recoup nearly half the Innisfail facility's $50-million cost.\n\nMr. Steel said that location is also ideal because the industrial park is focused on energy transition and hosts a solar energy facility and waste energy plant. \"They were welcoming and amazing to deal with, it felt right and the location is convenient, near storage,\" he said.\n\nDeep Sky is also looking to harness renewable energy sources at a time of growing demand from electric vehicles, data centres and other sectors. The company has suggested a long-term solution for its power needs could be small modular nuclear reactors, a technology that is also early in its development.", "source": {"uri":

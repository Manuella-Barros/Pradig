{"id": 231290818, "title": "Belmont Stakes 2024: Picks and predictions from the experts", "text": "Experts from The Post and Action Network handicap Saturday\u2019s 156th running of the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. Post time is approximately 6:41 p.m. Vic Cangialosi Post racing handicapper 1. Dornoch: His stock has fallen dramatically. Rightfully so and he will be priced accordingly as he looks to rebound off a flat Blue Grass and a \u201cno-show\u201d after drawing the rail in the Kentucky Derby. Does best running on the lead and Luis Saez will have him forwardly placed. Trainer Danny Gargan: \u201cKnock him. If he wins all the aggravation will be over.\u201d 2. Sierra Leone: Can Chad Brown, who grew up a few miles from Saratoga, take advantage of the home cooking and win his first Belmont? The Blue Grass winner lost the Derby by the slimmest of margins to a stubborn Mystik Dan in the thrilling three-way win photo. Stretch runner should have his table set with plenty of speed (Dornoch, Seize the Grey and Mindframe) showing the way. 3. Mystik Dan: Dan will be the only horse running in all three triple crown races. Tired? Maybe. Durable? Absolutely. Believe there is still plenty of juice in that lemon. Brian Hernandez found room on the rail and he outkicked Sierra Leone and Forever Young to win the Roses. Couldn\u2019t reel in Seize the Grey at Pimlico. First, then second and now an admirable third. Michael Leboff Action Network racing handicapper 1. Honor Marie: He had some supporters at a similar price in a deeper field at the Kentucky Derby but wasn\u2019t able to overcome a terrible trip. That bad break is keeping the price in a good spot for this contender. 2. Mindframe: Perhaps the most talented horse in the field, there\u2019s every chance we still haven\u2019t seen the best from Mindframe, and that is a scary notion for the rest of this field at Saratoga. 3. Sierra Leone: Lost by a nose to Mystik Dan in the Derby, and if it weren\u2019t for a tough trip, we would be talking about an undefeated horse ahead of the Belmont. As consistent as they come, Sierra Leone will almost certainly be there at the end of this race. William Schwartz Action Network racing handicapper 1. Mindframe: Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Todd Pletcher will seek his fourth Belmont Stakes victory with Mindframe in the running, and he has a great chance to secure it. This horse only has a pair of career starts, but he won both races with HRN speed figures over 100, and due to his lighter workload, he should be fresher than the rest of the field. With an outside post position, expect this speedster to get off to a quick start and maintain a lead. 2. Mystik Dan: Dan put in another strong performance at the Preakness but couldn\u2019t quite get the job done like he did in Louisville. With less ambiguity surrounding his status for this race than there was in Baltimore, expect the Derby winner to compete strongly once again.

Sierra Leone: This horse came up microscopically short in the Derby and should be well-rested after passing on the Preakness. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s favored on Saturday, but he could have a tough time pulling away in a tight field full of speedy horses.", "summary": "Experts from The Post and Action Network handicap Saturday\u2019s 156th running of the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Race Course.

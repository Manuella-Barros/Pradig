She received 3,377 votes bringing her to 75,900. This followed the distribution of the Billy Kelleher surplus of over 5,000 votes.\n\nMichael McNamara (Ind) is on 87,542, followed by Kathleen Funchion of Sinn F\u00e9in on 82,508 and Mick Wallace is in sixth on 73,947.\n\nDoubt surrounds Wallace's ability to attract transfers from Grace O'Sullivan following the distribution of her papers. Four candidates are in the mix for the three remaining seats in the five seat constituency.\n\nCork man Kelleher celebrated with his staff and party leader Micheal Martin at Nemo Rangers GAA Club in Cork after the 18th count.\n\nThe Cork man celebrated with his staff at Nemo Rangers GAA Club in Cork.\n\n\"It is emotional to be adjudicated by your peers and to be found to be in good stead with them is a huge honour,\" he said, thanking his wife, children and colleagues.\n\n\"Today really is a crowning achievement, to be vindicated for the last five years as their representative in Europe.\"\n\nTanaiste and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said \"there's a real prospect\" of Mr Kelleher's running mate Ms N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa taking a second seat.\n\n\"Suffice to say that the Fianna Fail campaign was around the idea that we need to send serious, committed, pro-European Union candidates, be critical yes, but pro the union (to the European Parliament).\"\n\nGreen Party representative Grace O'Sullivan has lost her seat as an MEP for Ireland South.\n\nShe is the fourth MEP to lose her seat nationwide after her party colleague Ciaran Cuffe, independent Clare Daly and Sinn Fein's Chris MacManus.\n\nIn a statement, Ms O'Sullivan said: \"Serving as a Member of the European Parliament for Ireland South has been the honour of my life and I am extremely grateful to the people of Ireland South who trusted me with their votes in 2019, and in 2024. \"\n\nShe said she \"came close\" to retaining her seat.\n\nMs O'Sullivan added: \"While losing my seat is disappointing on a personal level, it is just the latest chapter in a long story.\n\n\"For over 40 years I have been standing up for what I believe in, and fighting for what is right.\"\n\nAnti-immigrant campaigner Derek Blighe (IF) was eliminated in the 16th count.\n\nAfter the local and European election results, could we see a General Election in October 2024?\n\nLuke 'Ming' Flanagan has become the seventh MEP to be elected nationwide - with seven more yet to be declared.\n\nHe reached the quota after count 19, helped by thousands of transfers following the distribution of the votes for Aontu leader Peadar Toibin, who had been eliminated in the previous round.\n\nEarlier, Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew benefited from transfers from party colleague Chris MacManus. But she has since fallen behind Ciaran Mullooly again.\n\nMacManus lost his seat as an MEP and was excluded after count 17.\n\nReacting today after he was eliminated, MacManus said: \"It's no secret that Sinn Fein didn't have a good election day. Me and my team have worked very hard the last couple of weeks during the actual campaign.\n\nChris MacManus speaks after losing seat as MEP\n\n\"I committed myself to the full four years of being the MEP and worked as hard as I possibly could. Unfortunately, it wasn't me to be elected this time.\n\n\"Now, I am only hoping that my transfers work to ensure that Michelle Gildernew is there right till the end of the possibility of winning a seat.\"\n\nThe 17th count shook the positions of the remaining candidates in the run for five seats. Fine Gael's Nina Carberry received a fair amount of transfer votes bringing her back into second position, with 86,268 votes.

Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nLast night Ireland First candidate Derek Blighe was eliminated on the 16th count. His transfers were distributed with gains for all the remaining candidates but Michael McNamara benefited the most with 8,132, while Wallace took 4,764 and Kathleen Funchion close behind with 4,571.\n\nThey are now likely to slug it out for the last seat with Cynthia N\u00ed Murch\u00fa from Fianna F\u00e1\u00edl. Informed observers here in the count centre at Nemo Rangers GAA Club believe it will be Grace O'Sullivan who will act as the king or queen maker as she is eliminated.\n\nJohn Mullins of Fine Gael was eliminated earlier today on the 17th count.\n\nIncumbent Grace O'Sullivan has said she does not expect to be re-elected, which would be a blow for the Greens as Dublin MEP Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe also fell short of re-election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonnacha Maguire, who works with Billy Kelleher in the European Parliament, has been here since the count began to crunch the numbers.\n\nHe supports the view that Grace O'Sullivan's votes will decide the election once and for all some time this evening.\n\n\"I think we are at the business end of the day,\" he said. \"Billy will be elected on the elimination of John Mullins and his surplus, but the question is how much of a surplus Billy gets and how far over the quota that takes him.\n\n\"The second question is how many votes Cynthia N\u00ed Murch\u00fa gets from Mullins versus what Mick Wallace gets. So our hope is that there is a direct transfer to Cynthia N\u00ed Murch\u00fa which narrows the gap between her and Mick Wallace.\n\n\"So obviously when Billy gets elected his surplus should surely go to N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa because of a pro-Government, middle of the road-type vote,\" he said.\n\nThe number crunchers are running the odds; however no-one, including Maguire, is being definitive on what will happen at the death.\n\n\"N\u00ed Murch\u00fa getting a seat depends on Grace O'Sullivan's vote and that is the unknown. Grace is a Government MEP from the south east but Mick and Kathleen [Funchion] are also from south east. The feeling is there's a slight bias towards Cynthia N\u00ed Murch\u00fa based on the last five years in Government.\n\n\"It is going to be tight, I wouldn't rule out checking results after the fact - it could be down to 500 votes in the end,\" he said.\n\nN\u00ed Murch\u00fa yesterday, quoting from internal Fianna F\u00e1il polling, said that she is \"transfer friendly\".\n\nEither way today's events are predicted to come to an end sometime this evening.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

I am also proud to have worked on the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation as lead negotiator for the Greens/EFA, which will start to tackle the sea of plastic waste overwhelming consumers and make polluters pay.\n\n\"I was also a member of the Mercosur Delegation, where I fought tooth and nail to protect Irish farmers, and the environment, from a deeply damaging trade deal that puts profit before the wellbeing of people and planet. As a member of Delegation for Relations with Palestine, where I vigorously opposed the EU's support for Israel's disproportionate reaction to the horrific October 7th attacks, which has caused death, destruction, and misery to be inflicted on the Palestinian people.\n\n\"I worked extremely hard to build alliances to progress change - no Irish MEP authored more legislative reports (binding EU law) during the term of the 9th European Parliament than I did. I made every minute of my mandate count, and I have no regrets.\n\n\"I want to thank my team, my supporters, and Green Party members from across Ireland South who spared no effort, and left no stone unturned in my re-election bid, and ran a really fantastic campaign. I couldn't have asked for more, and will never forget the support I received. It is testament to their work that, despite challenging political conditions, I came close to retaining my seat, being eliminated after the 19th count, with close to 70,000 votes.\n\n\"While losing my seat is disappointing on a personal level, it is just the latest chapter in a long story. For over 40 years I have been standing up for what I believe in, and fighting for what is right. During that time I have experienced so many ups and downs - rough seas and calm waters, headwinds and tailwinds. Throughout it all, my commitment to fighting for climate action, for human rights, and for environmental protection has remained steadfast. This commitment remains as strong today as it was when I set out on the Rainbow Warrior at the age of 23.\n\n\"The European Union faces a challenging five years, and I wish our incoming MEPs every success during their mandate. I hope that they work constructively to defend the Green Deal, human rights and the rule of law, and to prioritise a Europe that tackles the social, environmental and economic issues that face Europeans across the continent.\"\n\nCount 19, distributing Billy Kelleher's surplus, is concluded with no-one else reaching the quota, so sitting Green MEP Grace O'Sullivan will be eliminated. More to follow.\n\nIt's worth recapping at this point that candidates do not need to reach the quota to be elected. The quota is a way of showing that a candidate cannot be overtaken - but the final seats can still be taken simply by having more votes than the next challenger.\n\nAs we approach the final counts, non-transferable ballots and ballots that have reached the end of their transfer journey mean that the total number bouncing around is reduced. The last seats in Ireland South and Midlands-North-West will likely go to people without quotas, as they did in Dublin.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il's Billy Kelleher is on his way back to Brussels after he finally made it over the finish line when thanks to 12,271 transfers from Fine Gael's John Mullins, he sailed past the quota with over 5,000 votes to spare, Barry Roche reports.\n\nT\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin turned up at the Nemo Count Centre for Ireland South just before Returning Office Martin Harvey read out the result of the transfer of Mullins' 43,601 votes, and there was loud cheering as Kelleher was hoisted aloft by his jubilant supporter.\n\nAttention now turns to the distribution of Kelleher's 5,344 surplus and where they will go, with Fianna F\u00e1il hoping they will transfer in sufficient numbers to his running mate, Cynthia N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa, to narrow the 1,191 gap between her and outgoing Independent4Change MEP, Mick Wallace.\n\nAfter that, the 20th and final count will see the distribution of the 68,000 plus votes garnered by outgoing Green Party MEP, Grace O'Sullivan to determine the destination of the fifth and final seat between Wallace and N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa.\n\nThat final count should also see the other two seats allocated to Independent Michael McNamara and Sinn F\u00e9in's Kathleen Funchion, who are currently on 86,757 and 82,315 and on course to book their seats on the flight to Belgium.\n\nBilly Kelleher (FF) takes the second seat in Ireland South. His surplus will be distributed, then outgoing MEP Grace O'Sullivan (Greens) is likely to be eliminated. More to follow.\n\nBarry Roche, who has had some time for contemplation in between Ireland South counts over the past week, previously reported that the ballots cast in that constituency would weigh 5.8 tonnes and stretch for more than 4,600km if laid end to end.\n\n\"Now for the piece de resistance,\" he says. \"On the basis that a 500 ream of photocopying paper is 5.2cm, the 713,000 ballots cast, if stacked one on top of each other, would extend 7.4km up into the air - seven times higher than Carrauntwohill and 22 times higher than the Eiffel Tower.\"\n\nAn update from the next count in Cork should be with us before too long.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew received over 20,000 transfers from Chris MacManus in the 18th count in Midlands-North-West, taking her above Ciaran Mullooly (Independent Ireland) in the race for the constituency's fifth and final seat, Fiachra Gallagher reports.\n\nMs Gildernew now has 74,795 votes, compared to Mr Mullooly's 73,101.\n\nAont\u00fa's Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn was eliminated following the count.\n\nLuke 'Ming' Flanagan will likely reach the quota on the next count.\n\nBarry Roche reports from the Ireland South race that early indications from the distribution of John Mullins papers on the 18th count in Ireland South suggest Billy Kelleher could get around 12,000, enough to get him over the 114,761 quota with around 4,000 to spare.\n\nIf that was the case, the 19th count would be the distribution of Mr Kelleher's surplus, which Fianna F\u00e1il hope will transfer strongly to Cynthia N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa to help her close the gap to Mick Wallace before the elimination of Grace O'Sullivan, whose transfers would then decide the destination of the last seat.\n\nIreland First Derek Blighe proved correct in his prediction that Independent Michael McNamara would the greatest beneficiary from his elimination, when the Clare-based TD picked up 8,132 papers to put him to the head of five candidates vying for three seats, Barry Roche reports from the Ireland South count in Cork.\n\nMcNamara is now on 83,702 over 2,000 ahead of Sinn F\u00e9in's Kathleen Funchion and both have opened a 10,000 plus lead on Independent4Change Mick Wallace on 71,910, with Cynthia N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa another 5,000 behind Wallace and Grace O'Sullivan another 3,000 further back again.\n\nFine Gael's second candidate John Mullins has now exited the race, and his 43,601 votes are currently being distributed, but the smart money now would be on McNamara, Funchion and Wallace to fill the last three seats in the five seat constituency.\n\nThere are two scenarios that might throw a spanner in the works for McNamara, Funcheon and Wallace. The first is if Mullins transferred in huge numbers to Kelleher, given that both are Cork-based candidates and their parent parties are in Coalition together.\n\nKelleher needs just under 7,000 to reach the quota but if Mullins was to transfer say, twice that amount to Kelleher, it would be mean Kelleher would then have a 7,000 surplus which he would hope to pass on to N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa to close the near 6,000 deficit by which she trails Wallace.\n\nThe other possible scenario is that when O'Sullivan, from Waterford exits the race, as is looking increasingly likely, she will transfer more to N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa, on the basis they are two women candidates and from the southeast, rather to her near neighbour Wallace from Wexford.\n\nBarry Roche reports from the Ireland South count: Outgoing Ireland South MEP Grace O'Sullivan of the Green Party said she had expected \"some degree of loyalty\" from their Government Coalition partners as she faced elimination in the race for the final three seats in the five seat constituency.\n\nSpeaking before the receipt of a whopping 7,675 transfers from Susan Doyle of the Social Democrats, which put the smallest of question marks over her exit from the race, O'Sullivan revealed why she felt she was less transfer-friendly now compared to in 2019 when she won a seat.\n\n\"I think we have seen an interesting pattern where I saw that Mick Wallace did better than I did on Sean Kelly's transfers which was a big surprise to me because Se\u00e1n Kelly and Mick Wallace in terms of policies would be polar opposites,\" she said.\n\n\"I found it strange that people were favouring someone with very different views rather than someone who is in coalition partnership with them and I had kind of expected some degree of loyalty there and we really haven't seen that at all,\" she added.\n\nKelly, who was elected on the first count with 122,776 votes, saw his surplus of over 8,000 go primarily to his running mate John Mullins who got 2,633 and Fianna F\u00e1il's Billy Kelleher, who got 1,963. O'Sullivan got just 361 compared to Wallace, who got 390.\n\nFiachra Gallagher reports from the Midlands-North-West count: Sinn F\u00e9in's Chris MacManus has lost his seat in Midlands-North-West, after he was eliminated from the race on the 17th count.\n\nWhile disappointed at the result, he said he hoped his transfers would boost party colleague Michelle Gildernew's chances of claiming the final fifth seat in the constituency.\n\n\"It's all to play for. The numbers, maybe, are not in Michelle's favour, but I wouldn't be writing her off just yet, there's another three counts to go,\" he said.\n\nHe said that Sinn F\u00e9in had lessons to learn from its performance in the locals and European elections.\n\n\"I think the important thing to go away [with] after this election is to listen to what people have said to us on the doorsteps, recognise the vote that happened on election day, give some recognition that people that do want change, some of them didn't come out to vote, some of them came out to vote and voted for independents and other smaller parties,\" he said.\n\nHe stressed that local and European campaigns are very different from general elections.\n\n\"A general election, when people realise they're voting for a Government, they'll resize how they voted, [maybe] they didn't come out to vote [in other elections], and will reassess.\"\n\n\"Sinn F\u00e9in will be in fighting order for that general election,\" he added.\n\nHe did not rule out running for the party in that election. \"I don't think it's the last time you'll see my MacManus name on the ballot paper,\" he said.\n\nChris MacManus (SF) has been eliminated from MNW on count 17. His 36,157 votes will now be distributed, Fiachra Gallagher reports from Castlebar.\n\nVivienne Clarke writes: Fianna F\u00e1il Senator Lisa Chambers has said that name recognition was a factor in the success of some candidates in the European elections.\n\n\"We knew before the campaign that name recognition was a big part because the constituency is so vast, stretching from Donegal down to Galway and right across the Midlands border into the commuter belt,\" the Midlands-North-West candidate told RT\u00c9 radio's Today with Claire Byrne show.\"\n\n\"People further away from where I live wouldn't really be with me. But if you are a celebrity you've been open to the media, like [ex-RT\u00c9 broadcaster and Independent Ireland candidate] Ciar\u00e1n Mullooly. You know, there's more familiarity with your name. And I think with a candidate list of 27 names to choose from, it's quite obvious that name recognition played a big role in the votes that people got.\"\n\nMs Chambers said she expected to be eliminated later today or tomorrow depending on how quickly the count continues. It was still possible that Sinn F\u00e9in candidate Michelle Gildernew could overtake Ciaran Mullooly to take the fifth seat, depending on the transfer of Niall Blaney's votes.\n\nWhen asked if a different campaign, with fewer candidates, would have been more successful for Fianna F\u00e1il in Midlands-North-West, Ms Chambers said: \"Of course you'd always wonder if the strategy was different, would it have made a difference? Because it does come down to at which point you're eliminated, because the longer you stay alive, for want of a better phrase, you're in the mix to get more transfers.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the campaign that I ran. I got a significant vote just shy of 45,000, which is huge. So I'm proud of that and of course, disappointed not to make it because you put a lot of work into these campaigns. But I got great support from my home county of Mayo as well. So I'm taking the positives out of this.\"\n\nFiachra Gallagher reports from Castlebar: Counting is under way again at the TF Royal Hotel, Castlebar, with all five seats in Midlands-North-West still to be filled.\n\nAfter a significant boost from Saoirse McHugh's (Independent) transfers last night, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Independent) looks set to reach the quota easily - at present, he sits on 103,653, less that 10,000 votes away from the quota.\n\nThe race for the fifth and final seat in the constituency was still wide open on Thursday morning, although Ciaran Mullooly (Independent Ireland) remains the favourite. After 16 counts, he sits on 71,107, ahead of Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn (Aont\u00fa) on 54,531 and Michelle Gildernew (Sinn F\u00e9in) on 53,129.\n\nThe count centre was quiet on Thursday morning - only poll-topper Mr Flanagan was present on the count-centre floor - but more candidates are expected to arrive during the day as the count nears its conclusion.\n\nBarry Roche reports from Ireland South: Eliminated anti-immigration candidate Derek Blighe of the Ireland First party who got 25,000 votes believes the bulk of his transfers following his elimination on Wednesday night will go to Independent Michael McNamara\n\nMcNamara, a former Labour TD for Clare, who has been critical of the government's handling of immigration, is in contention for one of the last three seats and Blighe reckons - and hopes - that he may help him take the seat when his 38,635 papers are distributed later today.\n\n\"I think they'll go to McNamara - hopefully they will - I heard some say Kelleher was getting No 2s, if he does, there's nothing I can do about it, that's down to the voters, that's not down to me so quite possibly they will though I'd say quite a decent share of them will be non-transferable.\"\n\nCounting is restarting at Nemo Rangers GAA club in Cork with the distribution of Blighe's papers with McNamara, Sinn F\u00e9in's Kathleen Funcheon, Independent4Change Mick Wallace and Fianna F\u00e1il's Cynthia Ni Mhurchu the most credible contenders for the last three seats.\n\nCormac McQuinn reports that Social Democrats candidate Sin\u00e9ad Gibney has said she personally lost \u20ac20,000 in her unsuccessful bid for a European Parliament seat and sold her car to part-fund her election bid. Ms Gibney fell short of the threshold for reimbursement of campaign expenses by just 440 votes.\n\nThat is the question that has resurfaced again after the success of both small parties in the local elections over the weekend, writes Sarah Burns. The Social Democrats almost doubled their local authority representation, going from 19 to 35 seats, most notably becoming the second largest party on Dublin City Council.\n\nThe Labour Party will also be pleased with its performance - retaining 56 seats, down one on its 2019 showing - but very much above expectations, and mostly notably, securing an MEP seat in Dublin.\n\nIn our overnight lead, the political team write the Green Party's hopes of salvaging sitting MEP's Grace O'Sullivan's seat in Ireland South were fading. The Greens' disappointment led to further criticism of Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il from Green deputy leader Catherine Martin on Wednesday.\n\nShe warned the climate crisis \"is way too important to toy around with\" during elections.\n\nAsked about attacks on her party from other Coalition parties during the campaign Ms Martin, the Green deputy leader, replied: \"I can't control the other political parties and what they might do.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crucially for her and Fianna F\u00e1il, the pro-European candidate was almost 2,000 votes clear of sitting MEP Mick Wallace of Independents 4 Change.\n\nGoing into the final hours of counting, the expectation was that transfers from outgoing MEP Grace O'Sullivan would heavily favour Cynthia N\u00ed Mhurcu more than Mick Wallace, and that turned out to be the case.\n\nWith 69,197 of O'Sullivan's votes being distributed, the final count left Wallace lacking on transfers with votes going along Government lines with N\u00ed Mhurc\u00fa helped over the line, head of Funchion, and into the final seat. McNamara, N\u00ed Mhurc\u00fa, and Funchion were all deemed elected without reaching quota.\n\nWexford and Waterford's MEPs depart, with Kilkenny and Carlow's newcomers now set to prepare for their first plenary session of the new legislative term, beginning with four days in Strasbourg from 19 July.\n\nFind out more here about what happens after the European elections.\n\nAs a sitting Carlow-Kilkenny TD, it remains to be seen as to what will happen to Funchion's seat in the D\u00e1il with a by-election for Carlow-Kilkenny likely in the offing, similarly too for Clare with the election of independent TD Michael McNamara. And with Taoiseach Simon Harris suggesting the Government will complete their term to 2025, these may not be the only by-elections to take place before the year is out.\n\nWe'll have more on this

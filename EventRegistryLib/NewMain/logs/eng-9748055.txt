The seven-episode limited series, which was adapted from author Laura Lippman's popular 2019 thriller novel of the same name, stars Natalie Portman in her first TV role. Portman plays Madeline \"Maddie\" Morgenstern, a bored Jewish housewife-turned-aspiring journalist, whose obsession with the fatal disappearance of a young Jewish girl (Bianca Belle) leads her to investigate another crime -- the overlooked murder of a young Black mother named Eunetta \"Cleo\" Johnson (Moses Ingram), whose body was found in the fountain of a park lake.\n\nLippman's book was inspired by two real-life and unrelated murder cases that took place in Baltimore in 1969, an 11-year-old Jewish girl named Esther Lebowitz, who received ample media coverage and whose body was found a few days after she was reported missing, and Shirley Parker, a 35-year-old Black woman, whose body was found in Baltimore zoo's lake fountain months after she went missing because someone had written to the local newspaper help column asking why the lights were off in the fountain. In the novel, Maddie's ambitious -- if, at times, self-absorbed -- journey to becoming a journalist and forging the new life she desires is told through the perspectives of those she's interacting with, from her landlord's eager daughter to her sexist coworkers at the newspaper; meanwhile, Cleo's ghost provides a haunting omniscient narration.\n\nRead more: Lady in the Lake Casts Natalie Portman in a Strikingly Subversive '60s Noir\n\nThe book is fundamentally a mystery, but it's also a clear-eyed examination of the restrictive social structures at the time -- for example, Maddie can't sell her car without her estranged husband's signature and resorts to committing insurance fraud with her wedding ring, while Cleo is subject to constant racial discrimination, even in death, when her murder is deemed \"not important\" enough for Maddie's newspaper to report on. And though they come from vastly different worlds and backgrounds, what Maddie and Cleo do share is a desire to live life on their own terms, free from the expectations and mores of others.\n\nFor director and writer Alma Har'el, who also executive produced the series, the parallel lives of Maddie and Cleo provided a compelling glimpse into the swiftly changing landscape of Baltimore, and more largely, society during this time.\n\n\"What really spoke to me was Maddie and Cleo and the idea of a murder mystery that has so many twists and turns, but at the same time, tells the story of the city and its politics and the social aspects of the time,\" she tells TIME. \"I felt it was like a double-edged sword in a way -- there's a whodunnit, who killed these women, but also what's within ourselves that we have to investigate and figure out to not become the people that we don't want to be.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Lady in the Lake and the book that inspired it.\n\nThough Har'el and the other writers who worked on Lady in the Lake rooted the show in the novel, they wanted to give a wider look at the world of 1960s Baltimore in the adaptation, which meant making some key changes.\n\nThe largest of these changes may be the expansion of the character of Cleo Johnson, the titular \"Lady in the Lake,\" who has a more richly developed personal life and backstory in the show. Likewise, Maddie's Jewish heritage and her inner life (a major part of her decision to leave her marriage and pursue a career) are explored in more depth on-screen, as are the secrets in her past. For Har'el, showing the role that both of these communities played in the development of Baltimore during the time was an integral part of the story.\n\nRead more: A Crime Writer Tackles the Sinister Side of Baltimore\n\n\"The story deals with two murders that happened and Maddie trying to solve these murders. Her connection to the whole city and to Cleo specifically, is what informs the tension of the whole show,\" Har'el says. \"Both of them as characters show us a picture of Baltimore at the time. There's something about the relationship between Black folks and Jewish people, who both suffered a lot of struggle, that has taken a turn in the 1960s. I very much wanted to bring to life both of those stories and make both of these women as rounded characters as possible to explore the conflict and the differences that came up.\"\n\nAdditionally, the details and circumstances surrounding Tessie's disappearance and death are fleshed out more and given a personal connection to Maddie. Maddie's investigation into Tessie's killer, Steven, and his mother is also given a more intricate storyline.\n\nThough many of the major figures in Lady in the Lake stay true to the book, there are some notable changes when it comes to some of the supporting characters. Some people from the book were replaced with new characters, like the novel's local dry cleaning entrepreneur and senate hopeful (and Cleo's secret lover) Ezekiel Taylor, whose role in the story became two new characters in the show: Myrtle Summer, a former teacher of Cleo's who's running for senate against the wishes of local racketeer Shell Gordon; and Slappy Johnson, Cleo's comedian husband. Others, like Latetia, Cleo's roommate, change slightly (Latetia becomes Dora, Cleo's lifelong best friend and a singer at the Pharaoh club). Still others, like Shell's right hand Reggie Robinson, are entirely new creations made for the show.\n\nHar'el said that the motivation for these changes was to imagine the nuanced and rich worlds of both Maddie and especially Cleo, whose storyline is expanded in the show.\n\nRead more: 5 Questions With Natalie Portman\n\n\"We wanted to create a whole world and write new characters that weren't in the book like Slappy Johnson and Reggie [Robinson], as well as the Pharaoh club and the political world she [Cleo] was involved in,\" Har'el says. \"A lot of it came from researching some of the stories that inspired the book, including the Black woman Shirley Parker, whose disappearance and murder were never solved, and reading about her life and the women in those circles and the jobs they juggled, the different kind of code-switching they did to just get by every month.\"\n\nOther characters were altered and combined to streamline the storylines and heighten the themes of the overall story. While in the book, Maddie doesn't have a personal connection to Tessie, the young Jewish girl who is murdered, whose body she finds by the same lake that Cleo's body would be found in months later, in the show, Tessie's father is Maddie's former boyfriend, whose reappearance in her life brings up memories of the clandestine affair she had with his father that resulted in a secret abortion.\n\nOf all the characters in Lady in the Lake, Cleo may have the most dramatic transformation from book to screen. While Cleo's ghostly narration from the afterlife provides much needed context in the book, the show presents a different and much fuller depiction of her character.\n\nCleo is depicted in the book as a young single mother who works as a dancer and bartender at the Flamingo, a club owned by Shell Gordon, on Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue. Although she's a loving parent to her two young sons, whose fathers are out of the picture, they live with her mother and father, while she lives with a roommate, Latetia. Cleo is described in the book as being hungry for life, and dating men from the club as a way to supplement her income, although she is secretly in a relationship with a wealthy married man, Ezekiel Thomas, who's running for a senate seat, when she mysteriously disappears.\n\nIn the series, while Cleo is still a bartender working at Shell's club (reimagined for the screen as The Pharaoh club) she also is his bookkeeper, making her privy to the illegal numbers game he runs -- although she is constantly searching for ways to sever her ties with Shell and his dealings, for the safety of her sons and because her father left town due to his gambling issues with Shell. Instead of dating men from the club as she does in the book, she is married to Slappy Johnson, a down-on-his-luck comedian with whom she shares two sons.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cady_lang@time.com", "name": "Cady Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_in_the_Lake_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady in the Lake (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Har'el", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alma Har'el"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleo_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleo (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Lippman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laura Lippman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natalie Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Ingram", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moses Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racial discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omniscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social structure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backstory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whodunit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lady-in-the-lake-book-movie-01.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748055", "eventUri": "eng-9748055", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 150}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The character (played by Natalie Portman) investigates criminal cases, several details of which Lippman has fictionalized.\n\nIf you want to take a peek ahead, here's a recap of the Lady in the Lake's book ending and plot summary.\n\nIn Lippman's book, Maddie is a Baltimore housewife who decides to leave her husband and start life anew. She ultimately finds work at a local newspaper and begins dating a police officer named Ferdie. After helping to find the body of a young girl, Tessie, she begins investigating the murder and corresponds with the suspected killer, a pet-store clerk.\n\nLater on, police find the body of a woman, Cleo (played by Moses Ingram), in a local park fountain. She'd been missing for months, and Maddie takes on the case.\n\nIn Lippman's book, the two stories converge surprisingly. Maddie confronts the mother of the pet-store clerk and learns that the pair worked together to kill Tessie. The mother, Angela, stabs Maddie, who survives and is taken to a local hospital.\n\nWhile there, Maddie meets... Cleo. The real Cleo. As it turns out, Cleo was having an affair with a Senate candidate, Ezekiel, and her nightclub boss arranged for her to be killed to prevent her from impacting Ezekiel's political career.\n\nThe body found in the fountain was actually Cleo's roommate, Latetia. Cleo criticizes Maddie for getting involved and trying to dig up the truth and disappears from the hospital. Maddie keeps the secret of Cleo's true identity.\n\nShe and Ferdie part ways after Maddie's reporting implicates Ferdie as her secret police source. She goes on to become a celebrated journalist, and a final first-person passage from Cleo (who assumed her late roommate's identity) reveals that she's been able to achieve a happy, full life.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleo_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleo (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smithsonian (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natalie Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_in_the_Lake_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady in the Lake (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Ingram", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moses Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezekiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-person narrative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/18/b0e87298/lady_in_the_lake_photo_010301.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748055", "eventUri": "eng-9748055", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

In 1966, just outside of Baltimore, a young girl is found dead. The woman who discovers her body, an aspiring journalist, becomes obsessed with the case, and it soon leads her to another body, another suspect, and a criminal conspiracy with dangerous ties to cops, politicians, and more.\n\nAll of this is true, but none of it is the full truth. Throughout the ethereal, furious, seven-episode limited series, layers are peeled back over and over. Sometimes they reveal new clues about the case. More often, they tell us something about the two women at its center. Yes, two women. Aside from Natalie Portman's hungry reporter, Maddie Schwartz -- a white woman (of course) whose personal yet picayune connections to the victim spark an outsized obligation to speak on her behalf -- \"Lady in the Lake\" is steered by Cleo Johnson (Moses Ingram), a mother working two jobs to support her sons, one of which leads her into danger and one of which leads her to Maddie.\n\nUnless Maddie is the danger. Taking an either/or question and answering, \"why not both?\" is a regular occurrence in this winding, atmospheric noir. Within its first hour, \"Lady in the Lake\" repeatedly challenges our assumptions about heroes and victims, first by upending our understanding of who the title refers to, exactly: There's the young girl, of course, but she won't be discovered until the first hour's final minutes. At the start, there's a man in a rowboat, dumping the body of a woman into a lake's fountain, accompanied by Ingram's mellow voiceover. \"Alive, I was Cleo Johnson,\" she says. \"But in my death, I became the lady in the lake.\" Then, directing her words to Maddie, she adds -- with just a hint of reproach -- \"You came at the end of my story... and turned it into your beginning.\"\n\nFrom there, the story jumps back one month in time, but unlike other artificial in media res openings (and, for that matter, other redundant, exposition-heavy bits of voiceover), \"Lady in the Lake\" wields each of its choices with unmissable purpose. The mystery may take a back seat from time to time, removing too much tension and leaving the dramatic burden on its hard-working leads, and Har'el can get a little too ostentatious with her symbolic gestures. (Cutting the dream sequences and hallucinations would've helped with cogency, perhaps even cutting the seven-episode series down to a more stirring six hours.)\n\nBut if you can track the tangled plot and set aside the typical priorities of a whodunit (aka asking, \"Who, you know, did it?\"), \"Lady in the Lake\" is absorbing from start to finish. Portman's fearless, uncompromising performance pairs perfectly with Ingram's steady grip on Cora. A deep bench of supporting stars provides fitting flourishes of their own, and a mesmeric ambiance -- conjured by the immaculate production design (JC Molina), snappy costumes (Shiona Turini), and eerie score (by Marcus Norris) -- befits this colorful noir perfectly.\n\nAfter all, despite its murder-durder premise (yes, Portman goes full \"wooter\" with her Pennsylvanian accent, and it is glorious), Har'el's adaptation of Laura Lippman's 2019 novel of the same name isn't as concerned with finding the killer as it with Maddie and Cleo finding themselves. \"Lady in the Lake\" is unflinching interrogation of identity forged through the thorny layers of American discrimination. Everywhere they turn, each woman faces misogyny and bigotry. They can't operate in the world without being allowed to do so by a man, and it becomes pretty clear, pretty fast, that they've both had enough.\n\nWhen we meet Maddie, she's on the brink of a mid-life crisis. But unlike men who tend to flip out over silly things like not having a good enough job or not winning enough awards, Maddie's breaking point comes from not getting to do, well, anything she wants to do. She's a housewife in a Jewish family in the '60s. Her self-centered husband, Milton (Brett Gelman), doesn't include her in any decisions. Her asshole of a son, Seth (Noah Jupe), is happy to mock his mother in public and berate her in private. She's been cooking and cleaning and party-planning her whole life, and guess what? She's sick of it!\n\n\"God forbid you go one day without me serving you,\" Maddie seethes toward Milton, as she packs up her suitcase. Back in the city (Maddie lives in the distant suburb of Pikesville), Cleo's lives an eerily similar life. Her husband, Slappy (Byron Bowers), is a stand-up comic who can't keep a steady gig and can't be trusted to keep the kids in line. He's rather do \"research\" for his \"work\" by having the guys over for drinks than keep their son from working with local hustlers, and since he's not supporting the family financially either, guess what? She's sick of it! Cleo packs a bag, grabs their kids, and high-tails it for her mom's house, hoping Slappy will learn his lesson with a little time to himself.\n\nHar'el studiously observes the similarities between Maddie and Cleo, while making sure to note the differences. Maddie can rely on her possessions and privilege to get started with a life on her own. She sells some jewelry, tries to sell her car (but can't without her husband's signature), and finagles an apartment from a friend with the promise of future payment. Cleo, however, is still supporting herself and two sons. She needs to keep working. She can't miss her dayshift at the department store, where she models outfits in display windows, or her nightly gig running numbers at a nightclub with its own local lottery. Also, Maddie is allowed to get mad (and hoo boy, does Portman get pissed). Cleo has to hold back the bulk of her fury.\n\nCross-cutting between each lead (as Har'el does frequently) reveals less of a mirror image than a distorted reflection. \"Lady in the Lake\" is hard on Maddie, calling out her blind spots and pushing her to better understand her own ambitions, but she's not without sympathy. Cleo, our sporadic narrator, is more clear-cut, even when her fate remains murky, and that, too, befits a series intent on examining the layers of American prejudice (both hidden and overt) without giving its characters over to them.\n\nAlong their journey, we get to meet a slew of strong actors who carry their scenes well. Mikey Madison, this year's Cannes breakout in \"Anora\" (and former \"Better Things\" star), plays a pot-smoking friend of Maddie's who says stuff like, \"There's nothing wrong with rolling naked in the grass with a bunch of boys,\" typically at inappropriate times. Wood Harris (\"The Wire\") guest stars as Cleo's intimidating boss. David Corenswet (our future Superman and former Ryan Murphy favorite) pops up as the deceased girl's dad (who has history with Maddie). Josiah Cross makes for a convincing part-time boxer, part-time bruiser with a soft heart, and \"Insecure's\" Y'lan Noel wears his Baltimore P.D. uniform smartly enough to tell he's a bit uncomfortable in the colors.\n\nA bird's eye view of \"Lady in the Lake\" may have helped, too. Time jumps and intricate plots can feel taxing and, like many vibe-heavy endeavors, if you aren't attuned to its rhythms, it's easy to drift off entirely. But the series is just as easy to admire for how thoroughly it subverts expectations, as well as its exhaustive love for its leads. There's enough truth here to make the search worthwhile.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_travers@indiewire.com", "name": "Ben

The year is 1947, and young Maddie is a budding journalist at her high school. She's set to interview Louise Durst (Rebecca Spence), her boyfriend's mother, whose paintings all but beg to be described -- by Maddie, at least -- as \"surrealist.\" But Mrs. Durst isn't quite taken with the word. And when Maddie offers her own definition (\"I think it has to do with the search for the marvelous,\" she tells us in a tight close-up), the no-nonsense artist counters with a line that may well be the thesis statement for show and character alike: What could be less marvelous than trying to define yourself?\n\nExcept, of course, Mrs. Durst is irked because she clearly doesn't approve of Allan's dalliance with Maddie. But the young girl's awe at those wild, colorful, and inexplicable paintings (shadowed faceless figures suggested by mere brushstrokes, greens, and yellows punctuated by darkened blotted silhouettes), as well as her definition of surrealism, speak to how writer-director Alma Har'el is crafting this adaptation of Laura Lippman's novel. How will Maddie define herself? How will she move away from the surreality of her marriage? How will she take the reins of a life on her own?\n\nBut this flashback also gives us two key images: the mustard yellow couch we saw a young, naked Maddie laying in where a naked man was washing off some blood (Hal Durst, it turns out, who's all too happy to regale the young Maddie when his wife has to take a call in the middle of her interview) and a painting by Hal (Mark Feuerstein) which features a lithe, pale, young woman laying in the middle of a lake in the nighttime -- a young woman that bears Maddie's face.\n\n\"You wanted to tell everyone's story but your own,\" Cleo says in voice-over, chiding Maddie for not letting us dwell on those details or how they fit together in the wifely life she then made for herself with Milton (Brett Gelman), the husband she just left behind.\n\nBut it's clear Tessie's death has rankled her for more reasons than she bears revealing. After having found the body, Maddie and Judith are taken into the station, where they're questioned (and suffer antisemitic comments, what with the cops thinking Maddie had too nice of a nose to have looked Jewish). It's there that Ferdie Platt first catches sight of Maddie, whom he'll run into again soon after.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Baltimore politics that's playing backdrop to Cleo's world is coming into focus: Cleo learns that her shady employer, Shell Gordon, once financed Myrtle Summer's campaign. But now Summer, wanting to make the city more progressive and rebuking Gordon's illegal numbers game shenanigans, has made herself a target: \"His only business is segregation,\" she tells her supporters. And Cleo's stuck in between: she believes in Summer's ideas, and that's why she volunteers for her (all Cleo wants is a good school for her boys), but it's Gordon who pays her bills.\n\nIn hopes of following Summer's words to heart (\"Our dignity can never be taken from us. Only surrendered.\") she asks the politician to give her a job. However, Summer cannot have anything associated with Gordon in her campaign anymore; surely, Cleo can understand that. But won't she still film the very support she voiced at the meeting just the day before? The craven request all but breaks Cleo, who, in front of the camera, refuses to play along: \"I can hold onto my dignity,\" she intones as she quickly breaks down, \"or I can provide for my boys.\" (Ingram is electric in this scene, able to conjure up a lifetime's worth of burdens she cannot do without; she's a woman at the end of her rope, unable to see a way forward). She's sick of her choices. She won't be a pawn for Summer anymore. Crying and distraught, she leaves in embittered tears. (So much for keeping her dignity.) Best she just provides for her boys, especially her sickly one. It's what drives her to Gordon's office to ask for more work, and finds him asking for more in return.\n\nCleo's not the only one needing to make desperate choices given her circumstances. After attending Tessie's funeral (and being lovingly embraced by Tessie's mother, a.k.a. Allan's wife), Maddie finds herself adrift. Milton doesn't understand what she's doing. Her teenage son, Seth, is irritable and perhaps rightly offended by her actions. And her own mother can't help but needle her about doing away with this nonsense of leaving her husband behind. And while she aims to do it all anyway, she finds it's harder than it looks: Milton won't give her money and she can't even sell her own car without his signature. In a frantic montage set to (what else?) Barbra Streisand's \"Gotta Move,\" we see Maddie at her wits' end. And you understand why she's driven to do what she does next.\n\nShe stages a robbery in her new downtown apartment. She rifles through her clothes, breaks some stuff, and hides her diamond ring in a potted plant, all before going to the diner nearby and using their phone to call the police. That's how Ferdie ends up at her place, rightfully suspicious of her claims. But he humors her and shares how she and Judith had been persons of interest in the Tessie Durst case (\"some lesbian crime sex or something,\" he tells her), which appalls her, but thankfully, given that they found aquarium gravel in her fingernails, they have someone else in mind already. He also shares a tidbit that feels designed to help caution her about what's to come: If the ring's insured, it will take months before she gets the money (you know if she's banking on it in the immediate future). Maddie may be slightly offended but knows better than to let it on she's been found out, especially since that's good information.\n\nAs was the aquarium gravel tip, which comes in handy when Bob Bauer (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a local columnist, comes calling at her door wanting information on Maddie and the Tessie case. Maddie is polite but finds the only way to get rid of him and keep him from further prying into her life is to give him that pet shop tidbit and have him leave right away.\n\nThe standoff at the pet shop that follows shows us that Stephan Zawadzkie (Dylan Arnold), who'd talked with Tessie about sea horses on Thanksgiving, is clearly off his rocker. He's tied up his abusive mother and dances back and forth while wearing a gas mask (his mother had found him bathing with fish with that same mask earlier and beat him in what felt like a familiar fashion), all while lots of police have surrounded the store and ready themselves to shoot as needed.\n\nSpeaking of shootings, that's what will close out the episode. Cleo assures Gordon she'll do what it takes to be in his good graces. It's why she convinces her husband Slappy to take a stand-up gig at the Pharaoh club (what better way to keep them both under his thumb than be their sole source of income?) and while he doesn't quite deliver the clean act he'd promised (\"You think Harriet Tubman had good pussy?\") it does give Gordon the sense that Cleo is all in. It's what drives Reggie, his right-hand man, to delegate a cash drop to her. He's learned from police that Zawadzkie's mother is trying to pin the Tessie murder on a colored man with a black eye who was in the store that day (that'd be Reggie) so he decides to lay low and give Cleo, donning her signature blue coat, a job she only takes because she's trying to stay in Gordon's good graces. Little could she know she'd be delivering a wad of cash to pay for a hit on Myrtle Summer: the hit men even insist she drive them, as they were expecting Reggie and trust her no further than they can throw her. Of course the shoot out doesn't quite go as planned: shots are fired inside the house but also outside of it since a guy with a shotgun was there. Was Myrtle killed? Will Gordon get found out? Cleo runs away ... is this why she was eventually killed?\n\nIt's all chaos, which is where Maddie's life is these days, what with her spending her night getting high with Judith only to need to wave her away once Ferdie arrives, both as a courtesy to let her know what happened at the store but also, as it happens, to be seduced by a very stoned still-married Mrs. Schwartz: \"Would it be unlawful if I offered you a beer, officer?\" is delivered oh so beautifully by Portman. As Cleo literally runs for her life, Maddie figuratively drives off a cliff away from hers.\n\n* \"My mother can smell everything, including my thoughts\" is a pretty great line, and tells us plenty about Allan's relationship to his artist mother (and also clues us into how much of a bad influence Maddie could be).\n\n* Portman in a 1960s funereal garb will never not read like a Jackie callback (easily one of my favorite performances of hers). Funny since here's a line from Lippman's novel, in Cleo's voice: \"You had a plain pillbox hat, no veil. I bet people told you that you looked like Jackie Kennedy.\"\n\n* I have an inkling that Dream Book and the numbers game will keep popping up (Cleo's son is no doubt not going to let that side hustle of his go, is he?)\n\n* How lovely was that mannequin surrealist sequence during Cleo's interview at Myrtle Summer's office? So simple yet so effective at showing us how Cleo sees others seeing her.\n\n* Almost as lovely as the Ana\u00efs Nin-scored surrealist sequence where we see Maddie's housewife life as a kind of playful, deadened tableau vivant. Here's the full Nin quote Judith regales Maddie with, and which, like the Durst interview that opens the episode, feels like a thesis statement for Maddie's life: \"Ordinary life does not interest me. I seek only the high moments. I am in accord with the surrealists, searching for the marvelous. I want to be a writer who reminds others that these moments exist; I want to prove that there is infinite space, infinite meaning, infinite dimension. But I am not always in what I call a state of grace. I have days of illuminations and fevers. I have days when the music in my head stops. Then I mend socks, prune trees, can fruits, polish furniture. But while I am doing this I feel I am not living.\"", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manuel_betancourt@vulture.com", "name": "Manuel

With all seven episodes directed by Alma Har'el (Honey Boy), the series artfully uses flashbacks and dream sequences, paired with classic whodunit elements and lush music choices, to craft a detailed and artistic story of two women whose lives unexpectedly converge in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nPortman plays Maddie Schwartz, a wealthy, white Jewish mother who becomes consumed by the case of a missing girl, Tessie Durst, at the local Thanksgiving parade. Getting increasingly more frustrated that people, including her husband and son, aren't more concerned about Tessie, and feeling stuck and unappreciated as a housewife, Maddie leaves her family. She moves into an apartment in a predominantly Black neighbourhood, living with the daughter of the apartment's owner, and following her passion for journalism.\n\nMaddie doesn't have a lot of money and needs to commit insurance fraud, claiming her wedding ring was stolen, to get her hands on some cash. That's when she meets Ferdie Platt (Y'lan Noel), an aspiring detective who responds to Maddie's robbery call.\n\n\"Natalie is somebody who I've been a fan of for a while, so to be able to watch how she works and prepare with her, and decide how we're going to go about a scene, to get in the scene and to see how things are working with somebody who you respect, it only makes you better,\" Y'lan Noel told Yahoo Canada. \"And it's really affirming that she she felt the same way about me. I'll always be appreciative of that experience.\"\n\nSpeaking about his character, Noel highlighted that a lot of the themes we see with Ferdie navigating his position with the Baltimore police as a Black cop is still relevant today.\n\n\"He finds himself in a place where the system isn't really ready for that type of representation,\" he said.\n\n\"What he ends up doing, he just is uncompromising and there's going to be consequences romantically and there's consequences at work that he just sort of stares into. ... At the end of the day, he doesn't compromise his integrity.\"\n\nWe simultaneously journey down the story of Cleo Johnson (Ingram) who, at the beginning of the series, is presented as a dead woman, providing a voiceover throughout the episodes.\n\n\"They say until the lion tells its story, the hunter will always be the hero. Alive, I was Cleo Johnson. But in my death I became the lady in the lake,\" we hear Cleo say in a voiceover at the outset of the show. \"You say you knew who took my life from me, Maddie Morgenstern. You said no one cared until you came along. Truth is, you came at the end of my story and turned it into your beginning.\"\n\nDiving into to Cleo's life as a Black mother and a waitress, she ends up stepping into her employer's illegal gambling operation as a bookkeeper for nightclub owner Shell Gordon (Seth Davis). This is right as one of her sons is sick with sickle cell anemia and her husband, Slappy Johnson (Byron Bowers), isn't making a lot of money as a stand-up comic. But he is adamant that he won't compromise his material to conform to what audiences had come to expect from a Black comedian.\n\nThe role was written sepcifically for Byron Bowers, who's a longtime collaborator with Har'el. Bowers is also a talented comedian, so his kinship with the character runs deep.\n\n\"I've actually lived those things,\" Bowers said.\n\n\"After Montreal, my JFL, I broke during my JFL Just For Laughs New Faces, because everybody was trying to appease the industry. And I started talking about slavery. And I got kicked out a few places. So I live that also. But that's a part of finding your truth and I knew I had to do that, because the greats before me did it already.\"\n\nBowers added that the time period of Lady in the Lake is also a \"pivotal moment\" for the comedians that have inspired him, from Lenny Bruce to Richard Pryor and George Carlin.\n\n\"This is when my style of dark comedy was born,\" Bowers said.\n\n\"It was good to go back and then show what their lives were like actually off stage and what some of these guys were going through, and how society treated them, and how they were kicked out at every place. And we don't see that a lot, right? In a dramatic way, we don't see it. So I'm very blessed to be able to do a story like like this, as this type of comedian.\"\n\nSomething that particularly appealed to Har'el about Lady in the Lake is the concept of how the oppressed can be the oppressor. While Maddie and Cleo are both trying to be freed from society's restrictions on them, Maddie doesn't have a real understanding of Cleo's life and her reality.\n\n\"I feel like my own existence is constantly struggling with the duality of being a white, Ashkenazi Jew, who grew up really with my grandmother and my mother, as survivors of the Holocaust, with generational trauma and arrived to Israel, where I grew up, and then discovering a whole side of that existence of being an oppressor and being somebody who has not accounted for the experience of others that are so close by,\" Har'el shared. \"It's, as an immigrant, something that I've encountered in the U.S. as well, this kind of parallel life, but I think that the goal was to humanize both experiences, and to also see the humour of it and the humanity of it.\"\n\n\"So many times in the past few years, I've encountered materials that were offered to me or that I've seen produced and they kind of get very caught up in this dichotomy, but from a perspective that is very judgmental of human nature. And kind of chooses sides and becomes very preachy, or kind of trying to indoctrinate you into a certain thinking, and tell you that you are either this or that, instead of connecting the dots and portraying really the human experience of all of us living in very hot water and trying to survive.\"\n\nHumour is something that Har'el worked with Portman on, adding this thin line of comedy in how Maddie navigates the world.\n\n\"She's just such a marvellous dramatic actress and she obviously chooses roles that are challenging to her,\" Har'el said. \"And this one was an opportunity to do all of that, but also not leave the comedy aspect, ... the ridiculousness, sometimes, and absurdity of this character.\"\n\n\"So the idea was always to totally have like one leg in the grave and one on a banana peel, and constantly push. Sometimes, in my vision, it was even more slapstick-y, but it was just really kind of pushing Maddie to be both authentic and grounded, and rooted in her own experience. But then also have an eye on how self-absorbed she is. And whenever we look at it from there, to also see the comedy of moving through the world in that way.\"\n\nHar'el also presents some moments in Lady in the Lake in a way that really tries to put the audience inside Maddie's mind, largely through the use of dream sequences to understand her subconscious. It's an interesting element to add to the robustness of the storytelling.\n\n\"Dreams get kind of interpreted many times as things that are reinforcing something we already knew from the plot, or exploring it,\" Har'el said. \"What I wanted to do is reveal new information and use those moments to kind of look at the shadow, if you may, of Maddie's subconscious, but also create a device that is almost like a continuation and a parallel to the whole investigative aspect of the show, but through dream.\"\n\nIn terms of how Har'el operates, the cast of Lady in the Lake praised both how she works with actors, but also her ability to strike that fine balance between creating a detailed world, but not being obsessed with perfection where it hinders the creativity of the project.\n\n\"She's not going to show any bad takes on you and she knows your light, even if you don't know your light as a person, she's good, she's magical with seeing people's light versus the robotic types,\" Bowers highlighted. \"That's the type of environment you want to to go into, whether you're on screen or in real life.\"\n\n\"She just creates a space where you can be your best self,\" Noel added. \"It's hard to articulate because it is a combination of play, emotional intelligence, ... compassion and empathy. ... It's just a dream to be able to work with as an artist, because she's one of the best.\"\n\n\"Alma's extremely perceptive and her aperture for authenticity is wide open. And while at the same time things were perfect, ... there wasn't an over-obsession on perfection, which is interesting, a super delicate balance to strike. ... That's an interesting space to be in, which allowed all of us to just surrender and to pay attention to what mattered most, which is what our character wanted in those individual scenes.\"", "source":

Redick. He relates to the 22-year-old rookie carrying the weight of an entire league on her shoulders, he told Redick.\n\nThe WNBA's newest superstar is starting to experience the negatives of being in the limelight after dominating college basketball for four years at Iowa.\n\nClark is averaging a solid 17.0 points and 5.5 assists per game, but she also has more turnovers (26) than assists (22) and is shooting just 34.3% from 3. The Fever have lost their first four games of the season, joining the Washington Mystics as the only two teams without a win through Tuesday.\n\nThe adjustment to the WNBA hasn't been as seamless as Clark would have hoped, and criticism creeping up because of the unprecedented attention she is bringing to the league.\n\nStill, Clark has James in her corner, and there aren't many more people in sports more qualified to speak on such pressure than the 39-year-old NBA legend.\n\nMORE: LeBron James lays blueprint for Bronny to succeed in the NBA\n\nInstead of focusing on her early-season struggles, James chose to shine a light on the positives Clark is bringing to the WNBA in her rookie season.\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing to her sport, more people want to watch. More people want to tune in. Don't get it twisted. Don't get it f -- ed up. Caitlin Clark is the reason a lot of great things are going to happen for the WNBA,\" James said.\n\nHe's not wrong, either. While it is not solely because of Clark, there is no denying that the young star's arrival played a major role in bringing more nationally televised WNBA games and chartered flights for WNBA teams.\n\nMORE: Caitlin Clark TV ratings: Tracking WNBA viewership records\n\nJames related to what Clark is going through, as she plays under a microscope as one of the most hyped WNBA prospects of all time.\n\n\"For her, individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said,\" James said. \"Just go have fun, enjoy.\n\n\"I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills. I hope Aliyah Boston does amazing. I hope they do great.\"\n\nMORE: Why Clark's slow start is no cause for concern\n\nJames also tied Clark's criticism to what he's experiencing with his son Bronny, who is going through the 2024 NBA Draft process with a bright spotlight.\n\n\"I'm kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching [Bronny], who's a 19-year-old who's getting a lot of animosity and hate towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream,\" James said.\n\n\"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown a -- men and women out here, doing whatever they can, to try and make sure that does not happen. ... It is what it is, but I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nClark still has 36 more games in her rookie WNBA season, giving the Fever star plenty of time to get things on track.

However, it has been a shaky start over the first two games, as the Fever opened the season with two consecutive losses.\n\nIndiana fell in their season opener on the road Tuesday against a Connecticut Sun team that finished 27-13 in the 2023 regular season, and made the WNBA Semifinals. Two days later, they lost 102-66 in their home opener against the New York Liberty, who lost in the finals last season.\n\nClark's debut game saw her finish with 20 points but also had 10 turnovers as she struggled adjusting to the speed of the WNBA. Clark addressed the media following the loss against Connecticut. \"Collectively, obviously 25 turnovers is going to make it really hard for us to win,\" Clark said, assessing her team's performance. \"They took 66 shots [and] we took 50 ... it's really hard to win games when you give [Connecticut] 16 more opportunities than we had.\"\n\nDespite the Fever falling to 0-2, Clark understands there's still lots of basketball left to be played in the season: \"There's gonna be good ones, there's gonna be bad ones ... you gotta learn from it and move on and be ready to go.\"\n\nClark did not address the media following the game against New York. She finished that contest with nine points, six assists and seven rebounds.\n\nDespite struggling out of the gate, the 22-year-old rookie phenom from Iowa carries with her an inestimable level of aura and attention to the women's game. The 2024 NCAA Women's Basketball Final between the Iowa Hawkeyes and South Carolina Gamecocks drew an estimated 18.7 million viewers according to Nielsen overnight figures, the most watched basketball game since 2019 (pro and college, men's and women's). Clark later appeared on Saturday Night Live, further boosting her platform and popularity.\n\nThe so-called \"Caitlin Clark Effect\" is real. The 2024 WNBA season is by far the most anticipated season in its history, dating back to its founding in 1996. Clark's arrival to the WNBA could be similar to what other sporting legends have done to their sports. Tiger Woods made golf more entertaining to watch, while playing with lots of fire and big fist pumps. He brought lots of athleticism and strength to his game, and inspired a generation of golfers to follow in his footsteps. Michael Jordan's multiple three-peats with the Chicago Bulls dynasty and his signature shoe line brought the NBA to new heights, paving the way for future hoopers to come. Caitlin Clark has the opportunity to elevate the product that is the WNBA, just as she did for women's college basketball.\n\nOn the court, it's Clark's playstyle that captivates her fanbase. Her ability to create her own shot, especially behind the arc, is what draws so much attention to her games. Clark averaged 31.6 points per game while shooting 37.8 percent from downtown in her final season with the Hawkeyes. She is a crafty ball handler that can dance on a defender and knock down step-back three-pointers with consistency, a la Stephen Curry. Clark is also an elite facilitator, as she averaged 8.9 assists in her final Iowa campaign. She is a great outlet passer, constantly igniting points in transition for her teammates, while playing with great anticipation and control in a half-court offense.\n\nThe Indiana Fever have a young core to build around, including 2023 first overall pick, Aliyah Boston out of South Carolina, and 2022 second overall pick, Nalyssa Smith from Baylor. With the arrival of Caitlin Clark, Indiana hopes to contend for championships in the years to come.", "source": {"uri": "highlandernews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Highlander"}, "authors":

Clark scored 17 points on 5-11 shooting, and she added three rebounds, five assists, and two blocks.\n\n\"I turned it pretty good,\" Clark told the media on May 20 afterward. \"I think it just got caught, I don't think I stepped on anybody. I don't have the best ankles in the world. It was a little tight this morning, but nothing out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"It felt good, I just wanted to get a lot more tape on it as fast as I could to get back out there playing,\" Clark added. \"It's hard, especially when I felt I started the game off good, then you get hurt and you've got to sit out the last five minutes of the first half, then wait for halftime.\"\n\n\"It's hard to get into a flow so I think it took me until the end of the third quarter to get back into a little bit of a flow, but every basketball player has had an ankle injury,\" Clark continued. \"If not, you're not a true baller I guess, so it'll be a little stiff but I'll be good.\"\n\nClark didn't have significant injuries during her storied collegiate career at Iowa where she became a national phenom. She played in 139 games over four seasons and became the NCAA's all-time leading scorer with 3,951 career points.\n\nThings haven't started as strongly for Clark in her WNBA career where the Fever have an 0-4 start, and she averages 17 points, four rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.\n\nHowever, she and the Fever made progress with their closest loss of the season. The Fever previously lost the first three games by 11 or more points.\n\n\"I think you can see the progress that this team is making and that's why this one hurts a lot, because we were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game -- and then you don't,\" Clark said. \"It's just some little things that we do to ourselves.\"\n\nIndiana had the lead 70-68 with 7:16 left in the game when Clark drilled a three-pointer from the logo. It came right after Aliyah Boston's block on the other end.\n\n\"I think it was a big shot,\" Clark said. \"It gave us some momentum, got the crowd going. Our crowd was incredible, our fans were incredible.\"\n\nBoston extended it to 72-68 with 6:06 remaining, but the Fever couldn't hold off the Sun, which grabbed the lead for good at 78-76 with 2:51 left.\n\nClark and company will get another shot to get into the win column on May 22 when the Fever visit the Seattle Storm (1-3). It marks the first game where the Fever will play a team with a losing record.\n\nAs Clark expressed in her pregame interview, she has been keeping things in perspective.\n\n\"Coach Christie [Sides] says, like, this is a process.

ESPN announced that 1.71 million viewers watched the game, which is the most-viewed WNBA game ever on ABC. The viewership numbers for Saturday's game peaked at 1.96 million.\n\nAdditionally, Saturday featured the most-viewed WNBA Opening Weekend doubleheader ever on ABC.

An average of 1.5 million viewers turned up across the two games, a 143 percent increase from the 2023 season average viewership on ABC.\n\nClark has almost single-handedly changed the way people look at the WNBA, and is bringing a level of popularity the sport has never seen.\n\nClark's jerseys flew off the Fanatics shelves in record time, and opposing teams have moved to larger stadiums to fit the massive amount of crowds that want to watch her play.\n\nClark has already made history multiple times early in her WNBA career. On Tuesday, it was announced she signed a deal with the Wilson Sporting Goods Co., becoming the first WNBA athlete in history to secure such a deal.

Clark left the game toward the end of the second quarter with an apparent ankle injury, but was able to return for the start of the third quarter and play the remainder of the game.\n\nThe Fever's next matchup is on Wednesday against the Seattle Storm.

LeBron James says he's openly rooting for the former Iowa star and No. 1 pick, hoping she changes the WNBA for the better.\n\nIn a recent episode of the Mind the Game Pod with LeBron James and JJ Redick, James talked about Clark's transition to the WNBA. While it's been a bit of a rocky start -- the Fever are 0-4 to start the year -- the NBA superstar believes big things are coming to the league.\n\nHe says Clark is the biggest reason why it will happen.\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing to her sport? More people want to watch. More people want to tune in,\" James said. \"Don't get it twisted, don't get it (expletive) up -- Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is gonna happen for the WNBA.\"\n\nFans are split on Clark's popularity. Although she's only played four games, there seems to be a \"love her or hate her\" mentality regarding the rookie. There's no question, though, she's helped bring more attention to the WNBA in a short period of time.\n\nAs difficult as it might be, James said Clark needs to find ways to block out all of the noise and just focus on enjoying her rookie season.\n\n\"For her, individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said. Just go have fun, enjoy,\" James aid. \"But I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills. I hope Aliyah Boston does amazing. I hope they do great.\"\n\nThrough four games, Clark leads the Fever in scoring and is the team's top passer, averaging 17 points and 5.5 assists per game.

She began to rise in popularity during this year's March Madness tournament where she broke several records within the span of a few days, including the record for most career points scored in Division 1 history for both men and women.\n\nHowever, with her team the Indiana Fever on a 0-4 losing streak as of Monday's game against Connecticut, people are starting to question whether or not she is ready to carry the team and if she will be able to perform like she did at the collegiate level with the added pressure of fans' expectations.\n\nJames, who is on his 22nd season and a four-time NBA champion, discussed with his podcast cohost and former NBA player, JJ Reddick, his own experience entering the NBA at a young age and navigating all that came with it. James shared that like Clark, there was a lot of pressure on him from both the outside and inside, and that he even had to listen to his own teammates say things like, \"We're not putting our faith into an 18-year-old kid.\"\n\nJames shared what he did to block out all of the opinions and told Clark to \"put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft -- kind of keep your mouth shut.\" He advised her to stay quiet, \"because everybody is looking for you to say anything and they're going to splice it and cut it and make it a negative thing.\"\n\nMonday's game between the Indiana Fever and the Connecticut Sun reached 2.97 million viewers, making it the highest-viewed WNBA game on ESPN. \"More people want to watch, more people want to tune in,\" James said, reminding his listeners of the progress that has been made now that Clark is bringing a much larger audience to the WNBA.\n\nJames emphasized that Clark is a large factor contributing to the WNBA being taken more seriously and that, despite the criticism and recent losses, \"The Caitlin Clark Effect,\" a new term coined by the public, is still absolutely in full force.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LeBron-James-and-Caitlin-Clark.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Everyone should be praising Clark for the impact she's already made on the sport, and yet, she's getting an enormous amount of hate.\n\nJames isn't happy with that.\n\nIn a recent episode of his \"Mind the Game\" podcast with JJ Redick, James had a lot to say about the disrespect that's being directed at Clark.\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing into her sport: More people want to watch, more people want to tune in,\" James said. \"Don't get it twisted. Don't get it f***ed up. Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is going to happen for the WNBA. But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said. Just go, have fun, enjoy.\"\n\nJames currently has a 19-year-old son who's trying to make the NBA. Bronny James has been the subject of criticism as he goes through this process, and James sees a lot of similarities between the spotlight on his son and the WNBA superstar.\n\n\"I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching my son, who's a 19-year-old, kind of getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream,\" James said. \"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown-ass men and women out here doing whatever they can to try to make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is. And I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nThrough her first four games, Clark hasn't let the hate get to her. The 22-year-old is averaging 17.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game, and has already given the fans some classic moments like this pull-up 3-pointer:\n\nThe Fever are 0-4, but they're a very young team trying to jell just over a month after the WNBA Draft. They showed signs of progress in their most recent game, a near loss to the Connecticut Sun in which Clark injured her ankle but returned to the game. Indiana will look to continue its momentum Wednesday night against the Seattle Storm.\n\nWith all the hate coming Clark's way, she at least knows she has one big fan in James.\n\nJames, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, had the highest of expectations on him the moment he was drafted into the league. Twenty-one years later, those haven't gone away. The hate hasn't, either.\n\nJames completely understands what Clark is going through, and wants her to push through and succeed.\n\n\"I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before.

Now, after the Indiana Fever's 0-4 start, a new wave of WNBA \"fans\" are filling social media platforms with obnoxious, unhealthy rants.\n\nMuch like Taylor Swift and her \"Swifties,\" Clark has garnered somewhat of a cult following -- most of whom never watched a WNBA game prior to the Fever's season opener May 14 against the Connecticut Sun. While there's absolutely nothing wrong with fans supporting their favorite player, there's a blind belief that the Indiana rookie has done no wrong through her first four games.\n\nInstead, there's been an awful lot of finger pointing. Clark's biggest followers have called for Fever coach Christie Sides to be fired. They've complained that veteran players across the league are treating her unfairly. The blame game has gotten so toxic that Indiana teammate and 2023 No. 1 pick Aliyah Boston told ESPN's Holly Rowe she deleted X from her phone.\n\nTo be clear, none of this is Clark's fault. It's not her responsibility to control the social media mob. Her job is to find ways to be successful in the WNBA -- a process that takes time.\n\nThese newfound WNBA fans talked themselves into believing Clark's dominance at the college level would translate to the professional level without so much as a hiccup. And when veteran guard Diana Taurasi tried to explain why that transition is complicated, many of Clark's fans called the three-time champion and former league MVP \"jealous.\"\n\n\"Look, SVP, reality is coming. There's levels to this thing. And that's life, we all went through it,\" Taurasi told ESPN's Scott Van Pelt in April. \"And you see it on the NBA side and you're gonna see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you're going to come (into a league) with some grown women who have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\n\n\"Not saying that's not gonna translate. Because when you're great at what you do, you're just gonna get better. But there is gonna be a transition period, where you're gonna have to give yourself some grace as a rookie.\"\n\nIt's almost like the 20-year WNBA veteran knew what she wasn't talking about, wasn't it? Crazy.\n\nClark has had her fair share of faults during Indiana's 0-4 start. She has 26 turnovers, including 10 in her first game - a WNBA record for a rookie debut. In Monday night's 88-84 loss to the Sun, she had a two-possession sequence that proved to be incredibly costly to the Fever.\n\nWith just over four minutes to play and Indiana owning a 76-72 lead, Clark turned the ball over and immediately committed a foul. Tyasha Harris quickly made a 3-pointer, cutting the Sun's deficit to just one point.\n\nOn the next possession, Clark was stripped by Alyssa Thomas, who tried to get an easy bucket in transition. Clark committed an open-court foul and picked up a technical foul for chirping at an official.\n\nTo use a tired, old phrase: Rookie mistake.\n\nBut you know what? That's OK. Clark is in her first season in the WNBA -- it's going to take time to figure this thing out. For those of you who thought she'd dominate the league from the moment she stepped on a court? That's on you. There's no need to blame her coach, teammates and officials. Remember when you started your first job? This is no different.\n\nIt hasn't all been bad for Clark. Through four games, she's demonstrated she still can knock down triples \"from the logo.\" She's still able to drive to the basket. She needs to adapt her considerable passing skills to the professional game, but she can be one of the best in the league.\n\nIndiana had spent just 22 days together as a complete team heading into Monday night's game against Connecticut. Because the WNBA season begins shortly after the women's college basketball season concludes, Clark didn't get an offseason of training to prepare for the strength, physicality and toughness within the league.\n\nAll of this factors into why Clark and the Fever have struggled early on this season.\n\nClark still has potential to be one of the WNBA's greatest players ever. She can still enjoy an incredibly successful rookie season. There are 36 games regular season games remaining -- plenty of time for Indiana's players to create some chemistry and start performing like a playoff team.\n\nSo, if you're one of those fans putting Clark's coach, teammates or league officials on blast for her early-season struggles, I have one word for you: Relax. Everything, eventually, is going to be just fine.\n\nDon't blame everyone else that you had no clue what it takes for even a college superstar like Caitlin Clark to adjust to the WNBA.", "source":

Clark, the all-time leading scorer in men's and women's college basketball, has led the Indiana Fever through their first four games, averaging 17.0 points and 5.5 assists. However, there has been plenty of criticism regarding her start in the WNBA.\n\nJames drew parallels between his highly anticipated 2003 NBA debut with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Clark's arrival in the WNBA, which has notably increased interest in Fever games, especially on the road. Clark's debut at the Barclays Center in New York saw the New York Liberty sell out the 17,735-seat arena and generate a league-record $2 million in ticket revenue, as reported by Doug Feinberg for the Associated Press.\n\nMany have buckled under the same pressure James and Clark have received, but James thrived, cementing his legacy as one of basketball's all-time greats. James, a 20-time All-Star, four-time NBA champion, four-time NBA Finals MVP, and four-time NBA MVP, holds the title of the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Remarkably, he plays at an elite level at 39 years old. And James is open about rooting for Clark to live up to the hype.\n\nThe excitement surrounding Caitlin Clark mirrors the anticipation surrounding James, although Clark is being celebrated in her unique class rather than compared to past legends. Clark, a two-time National Player of the Year in college, led Iowa to consecutive National Championship Game appearances, making her an obvious choice as the No. 1 overall pick for the Indiana Fever. Her early performances in the WNBA, alongside the surge in fan interest, underscore her transformative impact on the sport.\n\nJames has had to figure out how to thrive in a similar situation. An almost impossible hype surrounded him, and many anticipated and hoped for him to falter. He advised Clark on how best to deal with all of the talk.\n\n\"My advice to Caitlin, and my advice to anyone that comes in with this level of notoriety, out-of-this-world expectation, whatever the case may be, be a horse, man. The Kentucky Derby. Put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft.\"\n\nDuring the 2024 women's NCAA basketball tournament, NBA legend Diana Taurasi issued what many took as a warning to Caitlin Clark regarding her future in the WNBA. \"Reality is coming,\" said the legendary WNBA and college basketball star. She then added, 'There are levels to these things. That's just life. We all went through it,\" while speaking to Scott van Pelt on ESPN on April 6.\n\nBut Taurasi resurfaced with more comments about Clark, and this time, she was a bit more supportive of the young star. \"You know, these days, everything takes a life of their own,\" Taurasi told Arizona Sports' Bickley & Marotta show.\n\n\"Every little snippet, every little comment, any quote taken out of context. Look, I only said it because when I watch games -- and I'm sure when you talk to any professional athlete -- you think about what they'll look like as a pro. How will it translate (Clark's game to the WNBA)? It's going to translate. Like any college quarterback, it's going to take time.\"\n\nWNBA sharpshooter and New York Liberty Star Sabrina Ionescu even offered Clark words of encouragement before a Liberty vs Fever matchup earlier this season. \"She's just starting her career, and obviously, how she's been able to push the game forward is amazing,\" said the sharp-shooting Ionescu. \"Doing that in college and breaking so many records, knowing that she's just scratching the surface of what she's going to accomplish in the league.\"She knows I'm always rooting for her. I've reached out; we're pretty close. I just wanna be that person that she can always lean on.\"\n\nIt's excellent to see so many legends support Clark as they understand how much pressure she is under and how important her success is to the WNBA.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_lynch@heavy.com", "name": "Colin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1497428841-e1716394659367.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-06", "textStart": 2669, "textEnd": 2676}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The schedule wasn't kind with the first three games against two of the top teams in the league with New York and Connecticut.\n\nIt's going to take some time for the Indiana Fever's young star to find her groove against the incredible talent in the league.\n\n\"I'm just trying to remind myself, like, I know this is my job now, but, like, I have fun playing this game and I think that needs to be my focus through the course of this year. It's just like, have fun, that's when I'm at my best, too, and that's when I was at my best in college,\" she said after a 91-80 loss to the New York Liberty on Saturday.\n\nThe 22-year-old Clark had her best game of the young season against New York, but it still wasn't enough to get the Fever their first win of the season. The No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft from Iowa had 22 points, including 10 in the first quarter when she came out aggressively.\n\n\"I thought I came out and just played harder, and I think that's going to be just my biggest focus going forward,\" Clark said. \"Just come out and compete and play hard. I thought our whole group did that.\"\n\nHer offensive numbers are pretty impressive as she's averaging 17.0 points, 5.7 assists and 4.3 rebounds. She's now just the fourth player to have over 50 points and 21 assists in her first three games, joining Sue Bird, Nikki McCray and Candace Parker.\n\nThere are definitely areas for improvement. She's only shooting 40% from the field -- down 5% from her final college season and she has 21 turnovers in the first three games. Her 10 in the opening game were the most ever by a player in their debut.\n\nOpposing players have been sticking up for Clark when asked about the rookie.\n\n\"I think the media needs to give her a little bit of grace and time to develop into a player,\" Liberty center Jonquel Jones said. \"She's learning every game she's out there. Her impact on this league is going to be tremendous and only grow as she matures.\n\n\"But just give her some time, man. Look at Kelsey Plum and how it was for her when she first came into this league and the player that she is now. Just give her some grace.\"\n\nEven if her stats haven't been at the same eye-popping level they were in college yet, Clark has already left her mark. Her first three games with the Fever have been huge for attendance and TV ratings. The Connecticut Sun sold out their home opener for the first time in 20 years. The game set a record for highest viewership on an ESPN network for the WNBA.\n\nMore than 17,000 fans turned out for the Fever's home opener against the Liberty on Thursday night.\n\nNew York had a sellout on Saturday and the Liberty had more than $2 million in ticket revenue for the game at the Barclays Center, a WNBA record, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk about the team's revenue.\n\n\"I think the buzz and eyes that Caitlin has brought from Iowa now to the WNBA is going to be a collective win for all. When I first started in the league, some teams weren't even making revenue,\" Liberty forward Breanna Stewart said. \"It's a long time coming. We're happy to be at this point, but we're not satisfied.\"\n\nClark said she was most excited when she got back to Indiana that she was going to be able to move into her apartment. She had been living in a hotel since getting to the city last month.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Pledge_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate Pledge Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_McCray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki McCray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonquel_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonquel Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/DYPXVWWQGBCDLKOCIRU4B5LGZQ.jpg?auth=78b8c90863a8c53080287f2c7d5b4a58bcdc9b44e255fb3e46460f94264c0a68&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Her previous work appears in The New York Post and Popstar! Magazine.\n\nCaitlin Clark's latest game with the Indiana Fever left fans disappointed as the team suffered their fourth consecutive loss of the WNBA season.\n\nClark, 22, rolled her ankle in the first half of Indiana's matchup against the Connecticut Sun on Monday, May 20, forcing her to return to the locker room. Luckily, the first overall draft pick was able to return to the court in the second half for a thrilling sequence that saw her sink one of her signature three-pointers from the logo.\n\nDespite the excitement as the Fever looked more in sync than their previous three losses, the Sun handed Clark's team their fourth loss, making them 0-4 to start the season.\n\nAfter the game, Clark spoke to reporters about the status of her ankle. \"I turned it pretty good,\" she said during the press conference shared online by the Fever. \"I think it just got caught, I don't think I stepped on anybody,\" she explained, noting that she doesn't have \"the best ankles in the world.\"\n\nClark said her ankle felt a \"little tight\" on the morning of the game, \"but nothing out of the ordinary,\" she added.\n\nWhile fans assumed the basketball star returned to the locker room after rolling her ankle, Clark clarified that she \"just wanted to get a lot more tape on it as fast as I could to get back out there playing\" before the second half.\n\n\"It's hard, especially when I felt I started the game off good, then you get hurt and you've got to sit out the last five minutes of the first half, then wait for halftime,\" Clark said. \"It's hard to get into a flow so I think it took me until the end of the third quarter to get back into a little bit of a flow, but every basketball player has had an ankle injury.\n\nClark added, \"If not, you're not a true baller I guess, so it'll be a little stiff but I'll be good.\"\n\nA second sour moment for the WNBA star occurred when she was handed a technical foul for complaining to the referees. She appeared upset at a missed foul call on a layup, to which officials disagreed.\n\nIn video shared online, it sounded like she shouted, \"It's a f---ing foul,\" at the official, leading commentators to say she deserved the technical foul.\n\nA highlight for Clark, however, came after an Aliyah Boston block turned into an offensive opportunity for the Fever. Following Boston's defensive play, the Fever ran the floor and Clark swished a deep three-pointer that had fans at Gainsbridge Field House on their feet.\n\nAfter the game, Clark said, \"I think it was a big shot. It gave us some momentum, got the crowd going. Our crowd was incredible, our fans were incredible.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer , from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nDespite the losing streak, the Fever showed more promise in their matchup against the Sun. Moreover, Indiana's schedule has had them facing the top teams in the league to start the season, which is likely a factor in their disappointing record.\n\nClark also noted the disparity in free throw opportunities between the Fever and Sun in Monday's game. \"They shot 30 to our 13,\" Clark said to reporters.\n\n\"I think you can see the progress that this team is making and that's why this one hurts a lot, because we were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game, and then you don't,\" Clark said of the Fever's frustrating defeat. \"It's just some little things that we do to ourselves.\"\n\nNext, the Fever will travel to Seattle to take on the Storm on Wednesday, May 22.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popstar!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popstar!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/YnGJRm_F7u4OrWv9CppmNTZQx3s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(776x168:778x170)/caitlin-clark-indiana-fever-game-052124-1-63c441ae103e43659ed917198df70f75.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 384, "textEnd": 390}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 3673, "textEnd": 3679}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Some people might be shocked and caught off guard by all this, but can we step back for a moment and do some basic math? A team with the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft -- or any other league draft -- is usually coming off a bad season. The Fever were a bottom-tier WNBA team for a reason. Caitlin Clark, at Iowa, was playing on the second-best team in the United States for two straight seasons. She had an elite team around her. It doesn't mean that the team carried her, but it does mean that because four other players on the floor were really good, Clark had more space and more favorable matchups in which to operate. This enabled the game to open up in an ideal way. Playing with the Indiana Fever and not the Iowa Hawkeyes, Clark is now on a team at the bottom of her competitive world's food chain. It stands to reason that Clark's first season would be a struggle, and that Indiana needs more reinforcements to eventually build a roster which can compete for upper-tier status in the WNBA. Phrased very simply, this wasn't going to happen all at once. If you're truly surprised by Clark's difficult first week in the WNBA, you were expecting too much of her. This isn't her fault; it's simply the reality of going from an elite team to a bottom-rung team.\n\nThe Indiana Fever, still winless this season, have at least been more competitive in their more recent games. They covered the 4.5-point spread against the Connecticut Sun earlier this week, losing by only four points, their smallest loss of the season. The Fever lost their first two games of the season by more than 20 points. Their last two losses have been by 12 points or fewer. This team is becoming more competitive and more determined. Facing the 1-2 Seattle Storm, the Fever might have their best chance for a win in this game.\n\nTV: WTHR-13 Indianapolis (Fever) / Fox 13 Plus (Storm) / Prime Video\n\nCaitlin Clark might benefit a lot from the simple fact that the Fever won't be playing the New York Liberty or the Connecticut Sun, two of the three best teams in the WNBA last season. New York and Connecticut are good. Indiana is not. Naturally, it stood to reason that the Fever would be 0-4 through a bunch of games against the Liberty and Sun. The Fever have not yet played the softer, more vulnerable portions of the WNBA. The Seattle Storm currently look like a team which will finish in the lower half of the 12-team league. They're 1-2, and their only win was over a Washington Mystics team which is still winless after falling to the Los Angeles Sparks on Tuesday night. The Storm's win over Washington was made easier by an injury to a key player for the Mystics, Brittney Sykes. The Storm aren't that good a team; the Fever might finally have an opponent they matchup well against.\n\nWhy The Storm Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Storm should be confident after their road win at Washington. Indiana isn't playing well enough at either end of the floor to be trusted from a betting standpoint.\n\nFinal Fever-Storm Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Storm aren't very good, so even though the Fever are bad, this game might not offer you the betting clarity you hope for.

Clark scored 20 points in her debut but also struggled with foul trouble and had 10 turnovers. In her second game, she was held to single-digit scoring for the first time since her freshman year of college, as Indiana fell by 36.\n\nBut the tide began to turn for Clark and the Fever in rematches against New York and Connecticut, culminating in a near upset of the Sun in Indianapolis on Monday. Indiana started slowly against Connecticut but roared back to take a four-point lead late in the fourth quarter, before ultimately letting it slip away.\n\nClark, who left Monday's contest in the second quarter after twisting her left ankle, returned to finish with 17 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists. But most notably, the Fever as a whole began to operate like a unit, with Indiana's comeback starting when Clark was on the bench and Kelsey Mitchell (17 points), NaLyssa Smith (13), Temi Fagbenle (11) and Aliyah Boston (10) all finishing in double figures, as well.\n\nOne play early in the fourth quarter best captured the Fever's potentially bright future: Boston blocked a DeWanna Bonner layup and fed the ball to Erica Wheeler, who delivered it to Clark for a 33-foot 3-pointer to give Indiana the lead and send Gainbridge Fieldhouse into a tizzy.\n\nThe Fever are 0-4 -- their fourth such start in franchise history and first since 2021 -- but they made a statement Monday that more likely than not they won't be bottom-feeders for long.\n\nESPN's Michael Voepel, Kevin Pelton and Alexa Philippou assess the struggles and strengths of Clark's pro career through four games -- and what's to come from her and the Fever.\n\nVoepel: She has done what could be reasonably expected. The Fever's tough schedule to start the season meant Clark would immediately be facing not just playoff-level opponents but the top tier of those teams. During some moments, she looked a little uncomfortable. In others, she seems to be gaining confidence. The magnifying glass on her is enormous, but the actual performances examined through the prism of reality have been the overall positive mixed bag almost any top rookie has early on in a pro sports career.\n\nPelton: Improving. I was more optimistic than most WNBA analysts about Clark's rookie potential based on what we've seen from generational No. 1 picks in the past. Still, the time it took the most recent high-scoring guards drafted with the top pick (Sabrina Ionescu and Kelsey Plum) to develop into WNBA stars tempered those expectations. Clark's first four games have looked a lot like Ionescu's abbreviated three-game rookie season, which featured a 33-point game but also more turnovers than assists. Clark's scoring has come around the past two outings. Now, she must cut down on her turnovers.\n\nPhilippou: A lot of the reaction toward her early games said more about the expectations themselves (and whether they were realistic in the first place) than about Clark and her potential. It isn't a given for top picks (particularly guards) to come into the league and dominate in year one, let alone four games in. We've seen her impact the game in many ways, as she did at Iowa, even if her efficiency could stand improvement and her turnovers need cleaning up. Now, we get to see how she builds on it for the next 36 regular-season games.\n\nPelton: Being as effective off the ball as she was at Iowa. Second Spectrum tracking shows a massive split in the Fever's efficiency based on whether Clark brings the ball up the court. In 142 possessions where she has brought the ball up, Indiana has averaged 1.06 points per possession -- good for a top-five offense in the WNBA. When someone else brings the ball up, the Fever's offense drops to 0.82 points per possession, which would rank last.\n\nIf teams are going to deny Clark the ball, she has to be more aggressive either in getting open or leveraging that attention to make life easier for teammates.\n\nVoepel: Turnovers will jump to everyone's mind. Clark can't afford timidity or second-guessing herself as a playmaker while on the court. She can break down the performances on film and keep making adjustments. But she has to stay aggressive in games.\n\nTo use an analogy that fits Indianapolis: When she's behind the wheel of the race car, she has to go for it. Does that mean there will be a few crashes? Sure. But you're not going to win any race being afraid of the gas pedal.\n\nPhilippou: Building off Pelton's point, more offensive activity was something Clark thought she did better Saturday against the Liberty, the same game in which she finished with a season-best 22 points on 9-for-17 shooting. It's worth monitoring Clark's usage, role and synergy with her fellow backcourt teammates, especially as Mitchell makes a full return from her offseason ankle injury. In the rematch against the Liberty, Clark and the Fever also started to play with more pace, which helped the offense get going.\n\nThe physicality of defenses has given her trouble, and Clark said she has had to learn to not be passive when that happens. But the second line of defense will make her pay now in ways they weren't always equipped to at the college level.\n\nPelton: Boston's slow start stands out to me as the biggest indicator that Indiana hasn't yet figured out how to maximize her pairing with Clark. After averaging 14.5 points per game on 58% shooting as a rookie All-Star, Boston is down to 9.5 PPG and 40.5% from the field. Boston never shot worse than 46% in any four-game span last season. Clark and Boston already have run as many pick-and-rolls as any duo in the league, per Second Spectrum, but I'd like to see even more -- to put Boston in advantage situations.\n\nPhilippou: It was telling to hear Mitchell say Monday that the team doesn't yet have an identity: \"I think that's our next step, establishing who we want to be.\"\n\nOffensively, the Fever won't be at their best if they're overly reliant on Clark. Their offensive balance was part of the reason they came so close to beating the Sun; Clark herself noted the team is at its best when she is able to facilitate. Ultimately, there's no substitute for time and experience when it comes to learning how each team member likes to play.\n\nVoepel: The Fever don't have the kind of experience, individually or collectively, that many WNBA teams do -- and definitely not like New York and Connecticut do. Only one of Indiana's four games required late-game execution; the other three weren't that close. On Monday, had they executed differently offensively and defensively in the final minute, they could have won. Facing the same two opponents twice in a short time frame allowed the Fever to quickly use what they learned. So, that helps with the experience deficit.\n\nVoepel: Film work and managing frustration are both key. She knows she has a lot to learn about defensive schemes and how narrow the margin of error is in the WNBA. Clark got a crash course in the season's first week.\n\nCoaches will say thorough knowledge of personnel and scouting reports are what make the best defenders in the league as good as they are. Some of the WNBA's great defenders have elite quickness and lateral movement, while others might not be at quite that level. Yet what they have in common is preparation, high basketball IQ and a willingness to commit a lot of energy to defense.\n\nClark saw good defense at times in college, but this is like jumping up five levels. The more she understands the defenders, the more she can counteract their strengths.\n\nClark received a technical foul on Monday, but it isn't a big deal. She will learn the line she has to toe with the WNBA referees. Her passion on the court is part of the reason people like to watch her. She has to manage that, obviously, but she doesn't need to douse her own fire much.\n\nPhilippou: Getting into the practice gym would help Clark and the Fever enormously; their stretch of seven games in the first 12 days of the season is not forgiving for a team that would benefit more from teaching than an experienced squad. I suspect things will come together even more once they get additional practice time -- and later on when the Olympics break comes around.\n\nPelton: Ignore the noise. Good, bad or otherwise, everyone has an opinion on Clark right now -- most of them not from people who understand the reality of life in the WNBA. I'd echo what Wheeler told teammates, as related in Alexa's feature on Clark's first week as a pro: Stay off social media.\n\nPhilippou: The way in which they battled the Sun on Monday made me more optimistic that they can get there, although much of that depends on how other middle- or bottom-of-the-pack teams fare. But wins might be hard to come by for the foreseeable future: Indiana is back on the road for games against the Seattle Storm, Los Angeles Sparks and Las Vegas Aces from Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nThe Fever's ceiling behind improved chemistry and experience is high, especially considering their massive improvement over the past week. And for as much as the focus will gravitate toward the offense, given Clark's role in it, don't overlook the defensive growth needed for them to make the postseason.\n\nVoepel: Can they be a playoff team? is a different question than Will they be a playoff team? Because 8 of 12 teams make the postseason in the WNBA, teams can struggle a while but still put things together enough to grab one of those spots.\n\nSo, can the Fever do it? Yes. Will they? One week into the season, it doesn't seem like the playoffs should be the focus right now. Even though that's such a huge carrot for a team that hasn't been to the postseason since 2016, the Fever being better than last year really would be progress. That said, I think there's still a reasonable chance for the postseason if Indiana keeps building on the lessons.\n\nPelton: I projected Indiana as a playoff team coming into the season, and I don't think the Fever's start has been bad enough to dissuade me from that being realistic. I anticipated Connecticut and New York being two of the WNBA's top three teams this season, and it's worth noting they're a combined 3-0 against teams besides the Fever too.", "source": {"uri":

The Liberty became the first team in WNBA history to have more than $2 million in ticket revenue for a single game in it's opener.\n\nIn all, there were 10 sellouts during the league's opening week.\n\nRatings have been historic. ESPN's broadcast of Clark's opening night game when the Indiana Fever played the Connecticut Sun had the highest viewership for a WNBA game on the network. It drew an average of 2.1 million viewers.\n\nA doubleheader on Saturday that was on ABC featuring Clark and the Fever against New York and Los Angeles against Las Vegas put up impressive numbers as well. An average of 1.71 million viewers watched the first game while 1.34 million saw the Sparks and Aces contest.\n\n\"We're never satisfied as we want more tune in and more fans, but are really, really pleased,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"That's viewership against really tough competition of the Knicks and the hockey and Game 7s, it's not lost on me.\"\n\nChicago Sky forward Angel Reese (5) is seen during a WNBA basketball game against the Dallas Wings, Wednesday, May 15, 2024, in Arlington, Texas.

After Clark's big three, they battled bravely in a back-and-forth for the final 7:15 in the game.\n\nWith 41.1 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, the Sun took a two-point lead in the closing seconds. The Fever immediately called for a timeout.\n\nCaitlin Clark did not appear to be impressed by the play that Christie Sides, the team's second-year head coach, designed. As they emerged from the timeout, Clark was captured on camera appearing somewhat displeased, shrugging, and gazing at Erica Wheeler.\n\nIn the end, it worked out as Clark found an open Boston for a tying mid-range jumper, but the Sun made four straight free throws to close it out.\n\nWith 24 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists versus Indiana this season, Alyssa Thomas was just shy of recording her second triple-double.\n\nAlso Read: Social Media Lip Readers Reveal Caitlin Clark's Foul-Mouthed Message To Ref That Resulted In Her Costly First Technical Foul In The WNBA\n\nCaitlin Clark finished with 17 points and five assists in the final 10 minutes, making 5-of-11 shots and three 3-pointers, including a go-ahead three from the Gainbridge Fieldhouse logo that gave Indiana a 70-68 lead with 7:15 remaining, via ESPN.com.\n\nCaitlin Clark, the 2024 WNBA draft's No. 1 overall pick, scared everybody when the Indiana Fever guard badly rolled her left ankle midway through the second quarter of her fourth WNBA game.\n\nShe stayed on the court before being helped up and stumbling awkwardly to the locker room.\n\nClark returned to the bench after a couple of minutes but would not return to the game until the second half.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darrelle_lincoln@totalprosports.com", "name": "Darrelle Lincoln", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clark-enh-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

That's just life. We all went through it. You see it on the NBA side, and you're going to see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against some 18-year-olds, but you're going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\n\n\"Not saying it's not going to translate, because when you're great at what you do you're just going to get better, but there is going to be a transition period when you have to give some grace as a rookie. It may take a little bit longer for some people.\"\n\nWho would know better what lies ahead for the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader than the WNBA's all-time scoring leader?\n\n\"The new fans are really sensitive these days,\" Taurasi told The Arizona Republic during the Phoenix Mercury training camp weeks ago. \"You can't say anything.\n\n\"It's kind of like when you go from kindergarten to first grade, there's a learning adjustment. When you go from high school to college, there's a learning adjustment. I don't think I said anything that wasn't factually correct. Like anything, greatness is going to translate and (Clark has) proven that at every level. I don't see it being any different in the WNBA.\"\n\nAfter a week and four games into Clark's rookie season, Taurasi's blunt warning is proving to be somewhat prophetic.\n\nWhile leading Iowa to a 34-5 record during her record-breaking 2023-24 senior season, the 6-foot scoring sensation averaged 31.6 points, 7.4 rebounds, 8.9 assists while shooting 45.5% from the field and 37.8% on three-pointers.\n\nHeading into Wednesday's 7 p.m. matchup against the Storm -- her first WNBA game in Seattle -- the Indiana Fever's No. 1 overall draft pick is averaging 17 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists while shooting 41.2% from the floor and 34.3% on threes.\n\nThose are better than respectable statistics for Clark who is the favorite to win the WNBA Rookie of the Year award.\n\nIt must be noted she also leads the league with 6.5 turnovers per game.\n\nAnd the Fever are 0-4, including a couple of blowout losses.\n\nTo be fair, Indiana has endured a brutal schedule early in the season, which included home and away contests against the New York Liberty and Connecticut Sun before their three-game west coast road trip that includes stops in Seattle, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\n\"I think you could see the progress this team is making,\" Clark said following Monday's 88-84 loss to the Sun. \"That's why this one hurts a lot because we were right there, and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game.\n\n\"And then you don't. And it's just some little things that we do to ourselves.\"\n\nSpeaking of self-inflicted damage, Clark stumbled on defense while attempting to avoid a screen and rolled her left ankle midway in the second quarter. She went to the locker, returned minutes later and sat out the remainder of the first half.\n\n\"I turned it pretty good,\" said Clark who played in the second half and finished with 17 points, five assists, three rebounds and five turnovers. \"I think it just got caught. I don't think I stepped on anybody. ... I don't have the best ankles in the world. It was a little tight this morning, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"It felt good. I just wanted to get a lot more tape on it as fast as I could.\"\n\nSeemingly, everyone in the WNBA collectively held their breath when Clark went down and her injury status went viral on social media considering what she means to the league and her legion of sponsors.\n\nOn Tuesday, Clark continued to make history when she announced a marketing agreement with Wilson Sporting Goods -- joining Michael Jordan as the only athletes to be a brand ambassador for the sports equipment giant.\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed on a multiyear deal that includes a signature basketball line and a role in which she'll test, advise and provide feedback on basketball products.\n\nClark, who has endorsement deals with State Farm, Gatorade and Panini, also reportedly signed an eight-year deal $28 million deal with Nike that includes a signature shoe.\n\n\"I love the attention that she's drawing,\" Storm coach Noelle Quinn said. \"I love that we're going to have a sellout crowd and I love what (she's) doing for the game of basketball, not just women's basketball, but basketball in general.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Storm are expecting 18,353 fans -- their second sellout and largest crowd at Climate Pledge Arena -- as well as a franchise record-setting windfall of about $1.1 million in ticket revenue.\n\nThe Sparks and Aces moved their games against the Fever to larger venues to accommodate overflow crowds and cash in on the Clark phenomenon.\n\nThe Sparks relocated Friday's game from Long Beach State's Walter Pyramid (capacity 5,000) to Crypto.com Arena, which seats 19,067, in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe Aces, who play home games at Michelob Ultra Arena at Mandalay Bay (capacity: 12,000) will host the Fever on Saturday at 18,000-seat T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"With the growth of the WNBA, it makes me wonder if other teams also need to start getting ready right to play in bigger arenas on a regular basis,\" Storm chief sales officer Kyle Waters said. \"I'm thankful I work for a team that was ready for it.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Storm (1-3) will be ready for Clark and the Fever following a taxing east coast road trip in which star forward Nneka Ogwumike suffered an ankle injury that caused her to miss the last two games, including Monday's 74-63 listless loss against the Liberty.\n\nMuch like Indiana, Seattle hopes to rise from the bottom of last year's standings to the postseason with a reconfigured roster. Both squads have stumbled at the start of the season.\n\n\"Win,\" Storm guard Sami Whitcomb said Monday night when asked the team's mindset heading into Wednesday's game. \"We believe in each other and we believe in what we're doing. We know that we're right there.\n\n\"So, it's just fine tuning some things, we'll watch some film and we'll figure it out. ... Every game the mentality is to win. We've come up short a couple of times, but improvements are being made and we're right there.\"\n\nClark, who never lost four straight games at Iowa, echoed similar sentiments Monday.\n\n\"We were right there,\" she said. \"You got to keep your head up, but you also have to get a fire within you that is upset, and not OK with losing four straight to open the year. I think our group has that.\n\n\"But also, there's a sense of you know, this is helping us get better. There's going to be a time this season where it really shows that these four games we opened the season with, and it's going to pay off.\"\n\nNote\n\nStorm rookie and Croatian native Nika Muhl, who missed four games because of visa issues, is reportedly expected to be available Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors":

On his Mind The Game podcast with JJ Redick, Lebron discussed Caitlin Clark and the noise around the WNBA rookie sensation. Clark has massive expectations of her, not just from her team but also from the entire league. Lebron is an athlete who probably had the most lofty expectations of any athlete ever. He is probably the right person to give advice to Caitlin Clark on how to handle the pressure.\n\nOne of the few players who achieved a similar amount of fame prior to joining the league may be Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark. Clark was an Iowa Hawkeyes superstar in college. In her four years in the program, she broke the NCAA scoring record and, in her senior year, scored just over 28 points per game, the most of any player in NCAA history. James recently discussed his thoughts on the Clark situation with JJ Redick on his podcast, Mind the Game. He expressed what he thought of her as a player and the pressures she is currently under.\n\nRead More: Caitlin Clark WNBA Debut: A Rocky Start With Some Real Positives\n\nDuring his Mind the Game Podcast with JJ Redick, LeBron James offered the budding WNBA star some guidance. He said of Caitlin Clark, \"My advice to Caitlin, and my advice to anyone that comes in with this level of notoriety, out-of-this-world expectation, whatever the case may be, be a horse, man. The Kentucky Derby. Put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft.\" He says she can't give in to the noise and distractions. Lebron went on to say to be careful what you say because \"...everybody is looking for you to say anything and they're gonna splice it and cut it and make it a negative thing.\"\n\nLeBron also said that the evolution of the WNBA this season is due in large part to Caitlin Clark. He said, \"Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is going to happen for the WNBA... I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before.\" he referenced the WNBA using chartered flights for the first time this season. Overall, LeBron's advice is good advice for Clark. Clark is starting to really adapt to the WNBA. The Indiana Fever is far from being a good team, but the bones of a great one already exist.", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamil_david@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Jamil David", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/05/GettyImages-2041320655.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Lakers star hopes 'she kills' in WNBA", "body": "But the Lakers superstar understands what the WNBA rookie might be going through.\n\nLike Clark, James was once a young basketball player who entered the professional ranks with unprecedented hype in 2003, then had to battle through some ups and downs before his career got on track.\n\n\"I'm getting the same thing from watching my son, who's a 19-year-old, kind of getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream,\" James said. \"You know, there's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown-ass men and women out here doing whatever they can to try to make sure that does not happen.\n\n\"That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is, and I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nJames became a household name as a two-time Gatorade National Player of the Year at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. After graduating in 2003, he entered the NBA draft and was selected No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThrough his first four professional games -- the same number Clark has played with the Indiana Fever at this point -- James averaged 15.2 points with 8.2 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 3.2 turnovers. Solid numbers for a rookie, but not as mind-blowing as some may have expected or hoped. Plus, the Cavaliers lost all four of those games.\n\nJames finished the season averaging 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists, all career lows, as the Cavaliers ended with a 35-47 record.\n\n\"There's video evidence of my teammates basically saying, like, 'He's not ready' or ... 'we're not putting all our faith in an 18-year-old kid' or 'all this hype we've been hearing,'\" James told Redick. \"So my own teammates that I had to be on the floor with, practicing with, on the planes with, in the locker room, in game situations just had this kinda -- you don't wanna say hate, but just like animosity like toward me and what I could provide.\n\n\"And I didn't even come in with that -- I came in with the 'narrative,' but I didn't come in with that type of aura\" as Clark.\n\nClark became a megastar during her four seasons at Iowa. The Division I college basketball all-time leading scorer led the Hawkeyes to back-to-back NCAA tournament championship games the past two seasons, with her 2024 March Madness games drawing record ratings for ESPN.\n\nShe was drafted No. 1 overall by the Fever last month, and her debut with the team was the highest-rated WNBA game broadcast on ESPN. Clark's stats over her first four games are somewhat similar to James': 17 points, four rebounds, 5.5 assists, 0.8 steals and 6.5 turnovers.\n\nStill, it's a far cry from the numbers Clark posted last season at Iowa (31.6 points, 7.4 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.7 steals and 4.7 turnovers). And, like the 2003-04 Cavaliers, the Fever are off to an 0-4 start.\n\n\"People need to realize the Indiana Fever, this is the second year in a row they had the No. 1 pick,\" James said. \"So do you all know what that mean? That mean they're not that good. ... People are just like crazy about '[Clark] should be doing this and they should be doing that, if she's so great' -- it's still a team game, people. It is still a team game.\"\n\nJames credited Clark for being the reason the WNBA is allowing charter flights for its teams for the first time this season. And he said the league will continue to benefit from Clark's presence.\n\n\"Don't get it twisted, don't get it f -- ed up. Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is gonna happen for the WNBA,\" James said. \"But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said, just go, have fun, enjoy.\"\n\nClark and the Fever visit the Seattle Storm (1-3) on Wednesday at 7 p.m. before playing the Sparks (1-2) on Friday at Crypto.com Arena.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent\u2013St._Mary_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade_Player_of_the_Year_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade Player of the Year awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3f64b94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1400x788+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2Fe1%2F5021e1a64127a70d0c723e2ba446%2Fla-sp-lebron-clack-duo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The Liberty became the first team in WNBA history to have more than $2 million in ticket revenue for a single game in it's opener.\n\nIn all, there were 10 sellouts during the league's opening week.\n\nRatings have been historic.

We were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game and you don't,\" Clark said. \"We've played the top teams in the league and we were right there with the Sun today.\"\n\nIndiana's brutal schedule already has included two games against last season's WNBA runner-up, the New York Liberty, and two more against the Sun, who had the league's third-best record last season.\n\nThe result has been a predictably difficult learning curve - four straight losses, the first three by double digits - for a young team led by the league's newest star, who played in front of yet another announced sellout Monday night.\n\nAnd when Clark crumpled to the floor with 5:37 left in the first half, grabbing at her lower left leg and grimacing in pain until the game was stopped a few moments later, the Fever's chances looked lost yet again.\n\nBut after limping directly into the tunnel near the team bench, retaping her ankle and going through half-time warmups with her teammates, Clark was back - and looked more like the two-time national college player of the year during the final quarter than she had during the first 15 quarters of her pro career.\n\nClark finished with 17 points and five assists, all in the final 10 minutes, while making 5-of-11 shots and three three-pointers, including a go-ahead three from the Gainbridge Fieldhouse logo that gave Indiana a 70-68 with 7:15 to go and brought the crowd to its feet.\n\n\"That was a big shot,\" she said. \"We got the crowd going. I mean, that crowd was incredible.\"\n\nBut on a night Alyssa Thomas fell just short of a second triple-double against Indiana this season - 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists - and Harris had 16 points, three threes and the decisive scoring flurry, Indiana's miscues were just too costly.\n\nWith Indiana clinging to a 76-75 lead with 3:37 to play, Clark turned the ball over and drew her fifth foul when she tried to fight for the ball. She was called for a technical, too, when she shouted at the refs in frustration and the Sun took full advantage.\n\n\"This is what you expect from a young team, a lot of growing pains early on, a lot of ups and downs,\" Thomas said. \"But they have to be proud of how they responded with a hard schedule to start the season. They did a great job today.\"\n\nClark and the Fever will have another chance to pick up their first win of the year Wednesday at Seattle.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Maravich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Maravich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7cd0e8858a3b553c312a840cdbfc7484c98a8eb/0_236_4209_2525/master/4209.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=894284b062c0069bd8688417460534bf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It trailed only Clark's WNBA debut against the Connecticut Sun, which drew more than 2 million viewers, for the top spot.\n\nIn fact, through the first couple weeks of the season, the Fever have the three most-watched games in the last 22 years. Indiana's loss to the Sun in Monday night's rematch brought in 1.56 million viewers, which came in third on the all-time list.\n\nIt's been a rough start to the year for the Fever, who bring an 0-4 record into Wednesday's game against the Seattle Storm. As for Clark, she shook off a shaky beginning of her career and appears to have found her stride over the last couple games. Indiana nearly pulled off a fourth-quarter comeback against Connecticut on Monday as Clark totaled 17 points and five assists to help lead the charge.\n\nIt's not just Clark and the Fever drawing eyeballs, though. Viewership appears to be increasing league-wide.\n\nAfter the Liberty knocked off the Fever on Saturday, the Los Angeles Sparks and Las Vegas Aces capped off ABC's doubleheader. The two-time defending champion Aces came away with the 89-82 victory, but the game averaged 1.34 million viewers to become the most-watched WNBA game - outside of those involving Clark - in 20 years.\n\nThat was also the fourth game of the year to go over 1 million viewers. According to Sports Media Watch, it had been 16 years since the WNBA had that type of audience before Clark's record-setting debut.\n\nAt the tail end of her career at Iowa, Clark helped set multiple viewership records as she chased the NCAA's all-time scoring title. That continued into the NCAA Tournament, which saw three straight Hawkeyes games bring in record viewership - capped off by the national championship with 18.7 million viewers to become the most-watched sporting event outside of the Olympics and football since 2019.\n\nThe national title game took place April 7. Eight days later, the WNBA held its draft in front of a record audience in what ESPN's Rebecca Lobo called the most anticipated draft she could remember. Of course, Clark wasn't the only name on the board as she headed to the Indiana Fever at No. 1. Cameron Brink went No. 2 to the Los Angeles Sparks, two-time champion Kamilla Cardoso went to the Chicago Sky at No. 3 and Angel Reese joined her in the Windy City at No. 7.\n\nThat means it's not just Clark bringing eyeballs to the W.

Her sponsors include Gatorade, State Farm and Nike, with whom she signed a record $28m deal last month that includes a signature shoe.\n\nNews of the Wilson deal came less than a day after Clark left the court with what at first appeared to be a serious non-contact ankle injury. She returned later to get the Fever in position for their first win of the season. Clark fought through pain, foul trouble, even the frustration that led to an uncharacteristic late technical foul, only for the Fever to lose 88-84 to the Connecticut Sun and fall to 0-4 on the season.\n\n\"I think you could see the progress we're making and that's why this one hurts a lot. We were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game and you don't,\" Clark said. \"We've played the top teams in the league and we were right there with the Sun today.\"\n\nIndiana's brutal schedule already has included two games against last season's WNBA runner-up, the New York Liberty, and two more against the Sun, who had the league's third-best record last season.\n\nThe result has been a predictably difficult learning curve - four straight losses, the first three by double digits - for a young team led by the league's newest star, who played in front of yet another announced sellout Monday night.\n\nClark finished Monday's game with 17 points and five assists, all in the final 10 minutes, while making 5-of-11 shots and three three-pointers, including a go-ahead three from the Gainbridge Fieldhouse logo that gave Indiana a 70-68 lead with 7:15 to go and brought the crowd to its feet.\n\n\"That was a big shot,\" she said. \"We got the crowd going. I mean, that crowd was incredible.\"\n\nBut Indiana's miscues were just too costly. With Indiana clinging to a 76-75 lead with 3:37 to play, Clark turned the ball over and drew her fifth foul when she tried to fight for the ball. She was called for a technical, too, when she shouted at the refs in frustration and the Sun took full advantage.\n\n\"This is what you expect from a young team, a lot of growing pains early on, a lot of ups and downs,\" Sun veteran Alyssa Thomas said. \"But they have to be proud of how they responded with a hard schedule to start the season. They did a great job today.\"\n\nClark and the Fever will have another chance to pick up their first win of the year Wednesday at Seattle.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Maravich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Maravich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Farm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_guardian_765/cf552fb43cbaada11a2ba745b9ca7789", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He tweeted that Clark \"rightfully\" deserved the airtime and that his time was coming eventually.\n\nClark, of course, has done wonders for ratings when playing on national TV. As such, it wasn't exactly shocking when the Fever were scheduled for a ton of games on a national broadcast, even beyond ESPN.\n\nHere is more from Meghan L. Hall:\n\n\"They released their television broadcast schedule for the upcoming season, which will have several games shown on networks like ESPN, ABC and CBS but will also spotlight the Indiana Fever with 36 nationally televised games. That's more than the defending champion Las Vegas Aces (35 games) and the runner-up New York Liberty (31 games). That's also a 35 percent increase from the 2023 season when the Fever had 22 games on national television.\"\n\nClark is on national TV a lot but if the Magic keep winning, Banchero will have that opportunity soon as well.\n\nLeBron James defends Caitlin Clark against hateful backlash during WNBA debut Kamilla Cardoso's WNBA debut alongside Angel Reese expected against Caitlin Clark Caitlin Clark signs first new signature collection deal with Wilson since Michael Jordan Caitlin Clark earned her first WNBA technical foul in a hysterically NSFW way Caitlin Clark hit the best shot of her WNBA career so far on an electric logo 3-pointer", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_kalbrosky@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Bryan Kalbrosky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Banchero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Banchero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/05/MixCollage-22-May-2024-11-17-AM-758.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The transition take foul did not improve the situation, as it led to more free throws in crunch time.\n\n\"Just the technical foul, can't get that,\" Clark told reporters after the game. \"A little frustration of how the game was reffed. But it is what it is. That's out of your control. I thought our team put ourselves in position to make some plays to try and win down the stretch, and the Sun always came up with big plays.\"\n\nThe technical foul gave the Sun one free throw, which DeWanna Bonner hit to tie the score. This was a pivotal point in the game, and it was the final instance in which the Fever led.\n\nA back-and-forth struggle on the scoreboard finally resulted in a tie with 30 seconds remaining for the Fever, thanks to a seven-foot jumper made by Aliyah Boston after Caitlin Clark found her.\n\nBut with 11.1 seconds remaining, Temi Fagbenle of Indiana was called for a personal foul on Tyasha Harris, which resulted in two free throws. Harris would score two points from each to give Connecticut a two-point advantage over Indiana.\n\nAlso Read: Jemele Hill Thinks Caitlin Clark's Success Is 'Problematic' While Bringing Up Her 'Race

But WNBA opponents notice growth.", "body": "The Indiana Fever fell to 0-4 after a hard-fought loss to Connecticut, in which Clark had an eventful evening.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS - Despite suffering another loss, the Indiana Fever played their most competitive game of the season in their 88-84 defeat against the Connecticut Sun on Monday.\n\nWhile the Fever (0-4) are still looking to get a breakthrough win to jump-start their season, clear growth is being shown. Just last Tuesday, this same Sun team beat the Fever 92-71 in Connecticut to open the season. With first-overall pick Caitlin Clark and a young cast, the Fever are still figuring out how to play together.\n\n'It's gonna pay off.' Caitlin Clark hits signature shot in Fever's most encouraging game yet\n\n'I know what I bring to the table.' Temi Fagbenle provides energy for Fever\n\n\"This is what you expect from a young team,\" said Sun All-WNBA forward Alyssa Thomas. \"It's a lot of growing pains early on, a lot of ups and downs. But they have to be proud of how they responded. They've had a hard schedule to start the season, but they did a great job today.\"\n\nThe Sun are one of the WNBA's most consistent franchises. They've made the playoffs seven years in a row and have been at least a semifinalist for the past five years, despite not winning a championship.\n\nThe Fever's four games this season have come against Connecticut and the New York Liberty, who were 2023's WNBA runner-up. Indiana has played better against both teams the second time around, albeit in losses.\n\n\"Look, it takes a while,\" said Stephanie White, a former Fever player (2000-04) and coach (assistant from 2011-14, head coach from 2015-16). \"Building chemistry, learning how these teams are playing you in different ways, adjusting -- they're making some adjustments on both ends of the floor -- and executing those adjustments.\n\n\"So they're doing a really good job and they're playing hard. They're battling every single night and we knew that we weren't going to come in and do what we did at home. We certainly knew that, but we found a way to gut it out.\"\n\nWhite played for the Fever in the franchise's first five years of existence. The Purdue and Seeger grad was on the team for the start of the Tamika Catchings era, when Indiana made the playoffs just once in those five seasons. White returned in time to be an assistant on the Fever's 2012 championship team and the head coach of the 2015 squad that lost Game 5 of the best-of-five WNBA Finals.\n\nNow White is watching the Fever's youth movement from an opponent's viewpoint. With back-to-back No. 1 picks in Clark and Aliyah Boston, the Fever are hoping to someday regain the status they had in Catchings' peak. White is impressed by what Clark -- who's wearing the same No. 22 White wore -- has done so far in her rookie campaign.\n\n\"She's hard to defend all the time, not at times,\" White said. \"Her ability to score in multiple levels, to take what the defense gives you. She's such an outstanding passer.\"\n\nClark finished Monday's game with 17 points and five assists. She's averaging 17 points and 5.5 assists through four games. Clark had seven points and five rebounds in the fourth quarter of Monday's back-and-forth affair.\n\n\"She's good at shooting, getting to the basket and creating (for) others,\" said Tyasha Harris, the Heritage Christian grad who guarded Clark in the second half and hit the go-ahead free throws with 11.3 seconds left.\n\nWhile Clark made several great plays down the stretch, she also had two consequential turnovers that altered the game after Indiana took a four-point lead. Clark's averaging 6.5 turnovers per game as she navigates the strength and athleticism of WNBA defenders. Defenses have been able to poke at Clark's weaknesses so far, but White doesn't expect that to last long.\n\n\"You got to force her to do the things that she's -- I wouldn't say as comfortable with -- but the things that the numbers say she's not as efficient with right now,\" White said. \"And that's gonna be different next year because she's gonna get in the gym and she's gonna work on it.\"\n\nMonday's loss was encouraging for the Fever after three double-digit takedowns to begin the season. The 17,274 fans in Gainbridge Fieldhouse watched their team play at the same level as one of the WNBA's most experienced teams.\n\nClark and the Fever have made clear improvements a week into the season.

The Liberty became the first team in WNBA history to have more than $2 million in ticket revenue for a single game in it's opener.\n\nIn all, there were 10 sellouts during the league's opening week.\n\nRatings have been historic. ESPN's broadcast of Clark's opening night game when the Indiana Fever played the Connecticut Sun had the highest viewership for a WNBA game on the network. It drew an average of 2.1 million viewers.\n\nA doubleheader on Saturday that was on ABC featuring Clark and the Fever against New York and Los Angeles against Las Vegas put up impressive numbers as well. An average of 1.71 million viewers watched the first game while 1.34 million saw the Sparks and Aces contest.\n\n\"We're never satisfied as we want more tune in and more fans, but are really, really pleased,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"That's viewership against really tough competition of the Knicks and the hockey and Game 7s, it's not lost on me.\"\n\nMonday night's game, which was a rematch of the Sun and Fever, drew 1.56 million viewers on ESPN.\n\n\"It's not lost on me that on a Monday night to pull in that number, that's a really good sign,\" Engelbert said. \"Historically a lot of sports leagues don't do well that night except for Monday Night Football.\"\n\nIn all, the five games on ESPN networks this year have averaged 1.43 million viewers, which is up 181% from the same number of games last season.

On the 'Mind the Game' podcast, James drew parallels between his own early experiences in the NBA and Clark's current situation, offering advice and encouragement to the young star.\n\n\"My advice to Caitlin, and my advice to anyone that comes in with this level of notoriety, out-of-this-world expectation, whatever the case may be, be a horse, man.

Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is gonna happen for the WNBA.\"\n\n\"I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills. I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching my son, who's a 19-year-old getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream.\"\n\n\"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown a** men and women out here doing whatever they can to try and make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is and I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\" (43:25)\n\nLeBron James, who faced similar animosity when he began his NBA journey as \"The Chosen One,\" empathizes with Clark. Recounting his own experiences, James noted how even his teammates showed animosity towards him, despite his genuine desire to learn from them. He found this attitude strange but navigated it by focusing on his work ethic and staying humble.\n\nIn his advice to Clark, James emphasized the importance of maintaining focus and diligence. He encouraged her to work on her game, stay prepared, and learn from the veterans, all while keeping a low profile to avoid giving detractors any ammunition. James also highlighted the significance of Clark's impact on the WNBA, noting that her presence has drawn more attention and increased viewership for the league.\n\nJames's support is not just about offering advice but also about recognizing Clark's positive influence on the WNBA. He praised her for making people more interested in the league and mentioned the historic chartered flights now provided to WNBA teams, a first in the league's history, largely due to the increased attention Clark has brought.\n\nCaitlin Clark, a 22-year-old rookie sensation, entered the WNBA with high expectations following a stellar collegiate career at Iowa. Despite her impressive averages of 17.1 points, 5.5 assists, and 4 rebounds per game in her first four WNBA outings, Clark has struggled with turnovers and fouls, contributing to her team's 0-4 start. This has led to criticism from both fans and seasoned veterans of the league.\n\nLeBron's encouragement comes at a crucial time for Clark, who faces the dual challenge of proving herself on the court while managing external pressures. His words are a powerful reminder that staying focused, working hard, and maintaining a positive attitude are essential for any athlete facing intense scrutiny.\n\nClark's early struggles may be tough, but with support from figures like LeBron James, she is poised to make a lasting impact on the WNBA.\n\nRelated: LeBron James Hails Caitlin Clark After Record-Breaking First Quarter In NCAA Championship Game\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

While the Fever-Sun game didn't approach the viewership levels of the NBA playoffs, it topped the ratings for both NHL postseason games -- each of which aired on ESPN's main channel.\n\nNaturally, this piqued interest was a boon for betting apps. The WNBA's opening night bet count was up 516% year over year at Caesars, where handle surged 84%. The sportsbook took more bets on the Fever-Sun game than on any game from the 2023 WNBA season -- including six times the amount of bets placed on the decisive Game 4 of the WNBA Finals between the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty.\n\nAs for prop bets specific to Clark, they attracted more handle at Caesars than any of her games at Iowa or for any WNBA prop ever.\n\n\"With the huge influx of talent in this year's WNBA Draft adding to an already loaded wealth of veteran players, this year's WNBA handle will eclipse anything we have seen before,\" Caesars Vice President of Trading Craig Mucklow said in a statement provided to Sports Handle. \"We expect records to be broken on a weekly basis and even more so when the NBA Finals are over and the women's game gets additional primetime TV spots.\"\n\nA similar wagering scenario played out at FanDuel, which last week became the Fever's official sportsbook partner.\n\nTuesday's opening night saw a 230% increase in WNBA bet count over opening night of the 2023 season, while the amount of active bettors was up 194%. Of those placing wagers on the league, the sportsbook reported that over half were first-time WNBA bettors.\n\nSo was the Clark effect just a one-night wonder? Maybe not. DraftKings told Sports Handle that through the first week of the WNBA season, a span in which the Fever went 0-4 with a pair of losses apiece to two of the league's best teams (the Sun and Liberty), WNBA handle was up 150% and that the bet count rose 800% year over year.\n\nThe Fever fervor extended into the fantasy realm, where PrizePicks reported that Clark was chosen in more DFS lineups throughout the week than the next four most popular athletes combined -- male or female.\n\nClark's play has been uneven through her first four games. She's eclipsed 20 points twice, but had 10 and eight turnovers in those contests, respectively. Heading into a Wednesday night date with Seattle, Clark is averaging 17 points, 5.5 assists, and four rebounds per game.\n\nThere is cause for optimism, however. During the fourth quarter of an 88-84 loss at home to the Sun, Clark pulled up in stride from 33 feet and buried a 3-pointer, immediately calling to mind perhaps her closest comp: Steph Curry.\n\nIn his rookie year with the Golden State Warriors, Curry averaged 17 points, six assists, and 4.5 rebounds. It took him until his fourth NBA season to eclipse the 20 point per game mark.\n\nIn the women's game, Liberty point guard Sabrina Ionescu registers as the most Clark-like among current players. A No. 1 draft pick herself, the former University of Oregon star missed all but three games of her rookie campaign and registered averages of 11.7 points, six assists, and five rebounds on 38% shooting from the field in her first full year. Those benchmarks rose to 17.4 points, seven rebounds, and six assists on 41% shooting (Clark's current percentage) in her second full season.\n\nEither of these players' trajectories seem attainable for Clark, who's already emerged as Indiana's leading scorer and, in turn, is the focal point of any opposing defense.\n\nWhile the first week of the season is plenty encouraging, the jury's still out on how sustainable increased viewer and sports bettor interest in Clark and the WNBA will prove to be.\n\nThe second game of Tuesday night's ESPN2 doubleheader, a matchup between the defending champion Aces the Phoenix Mercury, drew just 464,000 viewers despite, as Sportico put it, \"a huge lead-in\" from the Fever-Sun game. Taking Clark's tilt out of the equation, that represented a 47% year-over-year drop from a comparable 2023 opener between the Sparks and Mercury, which marked Brittney Griner's first game back after her season-long detainment in Russia.\n\nAs for Clark, the ever-insightful Lindsay Gibbs wrote on a recent Power Plays Substack, \"The hope is that soon, Clark's rough start will be just a footnote. ... The hope is that her fans learn about other players in the WNBA, that they keep tuning in and buying tickets even if the Fever only win seven games this season.\n\n\"I don't know how good she will be in the WNBA pantheon -- it's clear she needs to gain a lot of strength -- but I do know that she will have some spectacular moments on the court in her future, and she will also have many, many more humbling ones. She has to give herself grace and patience. Fans and media need to give her grace and patience. And we need to give the new fans she's bringing in some grace and patience, even if we don't feel like it's being reciprocated.\n\n\"The WNBA is a lot more than Caitlin Clark. You know that, I know that, Clark knows that. A lot of people are just now figuring that out; let's hope they take the bumps in stride, and along the way, develop the type of respect for women's sports that's steadfast through turbulence.\"",

There was an expectation that Clark, together with the other rookies in 2024 WNBA draft class, would be able to carry over a large chunk of that fandom to the professional level.\n\nThe hope was that the viewership would ignite the nascent, yet often criticized and disrespected top professional women's basketball league.\n\nYet over the weekend, there was a noticeable viewership dip in viewership for the May 19 matinee between the Indiana Fever and New York Liberty as compared to the viewers who watched Clark's debut against the Connecticut Sun on May 14.\n\nRelated: How Caitlin Clark's WNBA debut viewership compares to other sports events\n\nThe opener of Clark brought in an average of 2.1 million viewers while Sunday's viewership number dipped to 1.7 million. Add the fact that Clark's debut was shown on ESPN2 on a weekday while her game against last year's WNBA runner-ups was on ABC and the viewership gap is even more glaring.\n\nBut this isn't a bad sign for the WNBA. If anything, this is continued good news for the league.\n\nRelated: The harsh reality behind the shockingly low WNBA contracts\n\nThe 1.7 million viewers is still nearly double of any WNBA game from last season -- including the WNBA Finals which were also on ABC. It's also more than any number the league has seen in decades as the league has not topped over 1 million viewers for a game in the 16 years.\n\nThe WNBA already has three games with over 1 million viewers this season -- including a game without Clark. That was the defending champion Las Vegas Aces against Los Angeles Sparks, who feature Cameron Brink, the rookie selected after Clark in the draft.\n\nThat game directly followed the Liberty and Fever game on May 19.\n\nMore Women's Basketball:\n\nThere could be concern that the slow start of Clark and the Fever -- who are 0-4 after playing two games apiece between two of the top teams in the league -- could hamper viewership numbers for the league. The NCAA benefited from having Clark and Iowa make consecutive runs to the NCAA Championship Game.\n\nBut Clark's struggles are par for the course for many generational stars, including some NBA counterparts like LeBron James and Victor Wembanyama. If Clark and the Fever find their footing -- even if it takes a few years -- there's evidence to be confident that the viewership and buzz will pick up.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nThe Arena Media Brands, LLC THESTREET is a registered trademark of TheStreet, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/z42knf/picture288618839/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/0b486c00-84fc-4fe4-8274-a4eb949d6101", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 502, "textEnd": 508, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 654}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I mean, sometimes it feels like the weight of the WNBA is on her shoulders,\" Bird, 43, told Eisen.\n\n\"That is both a compliment and warranted in a lot of ways but also may be a little bit unfair to put so much on her,\" the former Seattle Storm star added.\n\nWhen Clark appeared on Good Morning America before the season began, she was asked about the pressure she faces going into the league. \"Honestly, I feel like it's something that just comes with it and honestly, I don't feel a lot of it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's kind of just come with how I've carried myself and how I've gone about my business every single day and I think that's what I try to do the most,\" she continued, adding, \"But at the same time, I always remind myself this is a team sport.

Caitlin Clark has more national TV games than Magic's Paolo Banchero, and he's OK with it\n\nBeing the top scorer in NCAA history has its challenges, and Caitlin Clark knows this well. Since joining the WNBA's Indiana Fever, she's faced criticism: that she's a failure, not cut out for professional play, not physically equipped to face more experienced players, undeserving of her attention, and so on.\n\nHowever, the reality is that the Des Moines native is making a significant impact on her team. Although the Fever has yet to win this season, it's not Clark's fault but rather due to tactical issues and a lack of focus from several teammates.\n\nThe numbers support her performance: with just four professional games, Caitlin Clark leads the Indiana Fever in points scored and assists. So far, averaging 31 minutes per game, Clark has an average of 17 points and 5.5 assists.\n\nAnd she's supposed to be the rookie. Where are her more experienced teammates? Clark's 17 PPG are 5.2 points higher than her closest competitor on the team, fellow guard Kelsey Mitchell, who averages 11.8, followed by NaLyssa Smith with 10.5. And where does forward Aliyah Boston rank?\n\nClark nearly doubles Boston's points per game, who averages 9.5. However, Boston excels defensively, leading the Fever with an average of 7 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game.\n\nRegarding assists, Clark averages 5.5 per game, nearly double that of her teammate Erica Wheeler, who averages 2.8. She is followed by Kelsey Mitchell and Kristy Wallace, both averaging 2.0 assists per game.\n\nSo, if Clark is the leader in points, why hasn't the Fever won? There are several reasons, including the team's adjustment to Clark's style of play, multiple missed shots by several teammates, and more.\n\nBut improvement is happening. In their most recent game against the Connecticut Sun, Clark and company put up a strong fight, nearly defeating one of the league's best teams, losing 88-84. With 10 seconds left, Fever head coach Christie Sides opted to put the ball in Boston's hands, who missed an easy lay up, leaving the team no time to react.\n\nHowever, the Clark effect is becoming noticeable, and it's only a matter of time before that long-awaited first victory arrives for the most beloved and talked-about player in the United States.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristy_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristy Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/dde9468b8b8247743709cc00635b9d82/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/22/17163905439242.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The pace was going to be faster, there was going to be more physicality, and she was going to be playing against the best women's basketball players in the world.\n\nIn the Fever's first two regular-season games, Clark found herself falling back into her college habits. She wasn't aggressive enough, making decisions quick enough, and that turned into defenses easily reading the Fever offense.\n\n'It's gonna pay off.' Caitlin Clark hits signature shot in Fever's most encouraging game yet\n\nCaitlin Clark unfazed following injury: 'Every basketball player has an ankle injury'\n\nBecause of that, Clark turned the ball over 10 times in her WNBA debut -- some were from her teammates not yet being able to anticipate her passes, but some also came from dribbling off her foot or the Sun anticipating her pass.\n\n\"It's just almost playing with an aggressive mindset,\" Clark said Monday. \"I think when I was playing Connecticut and New York for the first time, I think I was just waiting too much for stuff to happen, rather than making it happen, whether it was my reads, whether it was waiting for our posts to come set ball screens. Like, that just lets the defense get set and do what they want to do.\"\n\nIt was something Indiana coach Christie Sides noticed about Clark's game, too. She was standing around on offense too much, and that wasn't working in the scheme Sides wanted to play.\n\nClark has more talent around her now -- including 2023 No. 1 pick Aliyah Boston, 2022 No. 2 pick NaLyssa Smith, 2023 WNBA All-Star Kelsey Mitchell and Katie Lou Samuelson in the starting lineup. Those players can facilitate an offense in a different way than her teammates at Iowa.\n\n\"I gave her a rule the other day that she's got 0.5 seconds to make a decision,\" Sides said earlier this month. \"When she gets off the ball, and she hits somebody in the high post, she has a habit of hanging out and dancing. That's what she's done, that's those habits we gotta break. She's got players around her now that she can get out, she can go screen, and the ball's going to get back to her. That's what she hasn't had in the past, so that's what we've been trying to show her and explain to her.\"\n\nSides is also hoping Clark will diversify her slot selection as she gets more reps in the WNBA. Clark only tends to take 3-pointers and quick layups or close jumpers, making it easier for defenses to read when she's going to shoot.\n\nThose are the only shots she needed to take in college -- opposing defenses could seemingly never figure out how to defend her. Now, opposing defenses know Clark's tendencies. They spent months studying her during her final college season and the WNBA offseason. So, Sides wants Clark to tap into the midrange game.\n\n\"I think she's used to some shots that she's taken in the last few years that are just those deep shots,\" Sides said. \"There's times she comes off ball screens where she's open in that long 2 area, and we've got to get her comfortable taking that long 2.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Clark said, playing basketball should be instinctual. The two-time National Player of the Year has been playing basketball for most of her life, and she was the No. 1 pick for a reason.\n\nShe needs to take those shots she's not entirely comfortable in, because that's the only way she can improve on it.\n\n\"Every movement just needs to happen a little bit faster,\" Clark said. \"The decision-making happens a little bit faster, and I also think, just don't overthink it. This is just basketball, you've played your whole life, and it's just kind of an instinct, it's not something you're really thinking about. It's just let your instincts take over.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Sides", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christie Sides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaLyssa_Smith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NaLyssa Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Lou_Samuelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katie Lou Samuelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/21/PIND/73779823007-2153896699.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2463,1386,x0,y369&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Following a historic college career at Iowa, the highest-scoring player in major DI basketball history is now tasked with elevating the WNBA to new levels.\n\nDespite a rough 0-4 start, Clark is already having a noticeable impact. TV ratings are up, arenas are being packed, the WNBA pivoted to chartered flights shortly after a single interaction with Clark and a fan at an airport, and there's never been more attention on the league than there is right now. That's great for women's basketball.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is pumped. A'ja Wilson took some racial shots at Clark, Jemele Hill claimed the Fever rookie is popular and marketable because she's straight and white, the press and media go after her and social media routinely targets the talented guard.\n\nWell, LeBron James has seen and heard enough criticism of Clark, and it's time to set the record straight. He bluntly admitted she's the reason people care about the WNBA now when they didn't before.\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing to her sport? More people want to watch. More people want to tune in. Don't get it twisted. don't get it f*cked up. Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things are going to happen for the WNBA. But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said. Just go have fun. Enjoy. I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills,\" LeBron told his co-host JJ Redick on their \"Mind the Game\" podcast.\n\nThe four-time NBA champion also pointed out very few individuals get to actually crush their dreams in life, and yet, people love to tear them down.\n\n\"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport, and we have grown ass men and women doing whatever they can to try to make sure that does not happen,\" the Lakers star said in connection with Clark and his son Bronny James.\n\nYou can watch LeBron's full comments below, and hit me with your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. His view is incredibly refreshing.\n\nThere is plenty to criticize LeBron over. Plenty. However, it's important to call balls and strikes. He's absolutely 100% correct with his assessment when it comes to the backlash and criticism Clark faces.\n\nInstead of everyone who claims to love women's basketball being excited, it seems like so many people love to take shots. Not only do people like to take shots, but it seems like Clark being white is a focal point.\n\nNo, her being white isn't the reason people like her. There have been plenty of white WNBA players in the past. None have come close to her popularity. Caitlin Clark is the face of the WNBA because she did things in college never done before. The young woman was drilling 3s from different area codes and dishing out passes like a female Steve Nash.\n\nYet, it's just not good enough for some. Instead of celebrating the Indiana Fever star for bringing in a ton of new fans, the critics just want to tear her down.\n\nLeBron might not be correct often, but he is here. I'm actually a bit stunned he didn't take this opportunity to lean into the same path as Hill and Wilson. It would have been very on-brand. Instead, he spoke the truth, and for that, he deserves to be applauded.

The college basketball superstar has had a rough transition to the professional court; her team, the Indiana Fever, is 0-4, and Clark is barely averaging 17 points per game. However, nothing is as bad as it seems.\n\nHer fans expected to see the Fever rookie sweeping her opponents from her first minute on the court. However, analysts like Xavier Handy-Hamilton warn that she is in a normal adjustment period for any newcomer and even assure that her numbers are above the entire 2024 draft class.\n\nClark left the NCAA with all kinds of marks, the most important being the most overall career points. However, in her first game in the WNBA, she set a record that no one wants: the most turnovers for a rookie in her debut in the league, with 10.\n\nThe Fever's record doesn't help the perception of Clark either. Fans expected the rookie to make an immediate impact on the team. However, their poor start has most fearing that Indiana is on track to be the worst team in the WNBA for the third year in a row.\n\nIt is true that the 17 points per game that Clark averaged in her first three outings are far from the 28.4 that she averaged in four years in the NCAA and even further from the 31.6 of her last college season. However, it is the best average of all the rookies this year.\n\nIf she just keeps up this pace, her first season could be better than those of stars like Kelsey Plum, Napheesa Collier, Sabrina Ionescu, and Alyssa Thomas. Her 50 points and 15 assists in three games are also among the best totals of almost any rookie in history, with the exception of Nikki McCray, Sue Bird, and Candace Parker.\n\nThe WNBA season is just beginning and Clark is not one to give up.

The excitement surrounding the league has led to players receiving chartered flights to and from away games, a significant upgrade reflecting the league's growth.\n\nCharles specifically mentioned Clark, the 2024 No. 1 draft pick, as a pivotal figure in this transformation.\n\n\"Clark is helping make it all happen,\" Charles said, while also acknowledging other standout rookies like Cameron Brink and Angel Reese for their contributions.\n\nThe buzz around Clark is undeniable. The former Iowa women's basketball star brought in huge audiences during her college career, and that momentum has carried over into her professional debut.\n\nSue Bird's call to action around WNBA rookies like Caitlin Clark\n\nThe excitement surrounding young stars like Clark has not gone unnoticed by WNBA legend Sue Bird. Bird issued a stark warning to the league, emphasizing the need to capitalize on the popularity of players like Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and JuJu Watkins to ensure they stay in the league rather than going overseas.\n\n\"When I started to see that, I literally thought to myself - I've never said this out loud, but from, not a player standpoint, but like a WNBA League business standpoint, they can't let these kids ever go overseas,\" Bird said previously. She stressed the importance of the WNBA making strategic moves to retain these players and their substantial fan bases.\n\nLas Vegas Aces star Candace Parker also weighed in on Caitlin Clark's impact, drawing comparisons between Clark and legends of the NBA and NFL. Parker noted that Clark's ability to attract massive audiences is akin to how certain players in men's sports have elevated their games' profiles.\n\n\"It's putting the sport at the forefront. We've seen it in the NFL, we've seen in the NBA and how certain players come in, and yes, they're still going to be remembered -- but it's about raising the game and that's what's most important to me,\" Parker said.\n\nClark's influence on the league was particularly evident when this year's draft racked in, drawing an average of 2.446 million viewers on ESPN, marking a staggering 307% uptick from last year's draft viewership. Her regular season debut with Indiana May 15 became the most-watched WNBA game in nearly 23 years, averaging 2.12 million viewers on ESPN2 and an additional 13,000 on ESPN Deportes. The viewership surpasses any game since the Los Angeles Sparks faced the Houston Comets on Memorial Day 2001, which drew 2.44 million viewers. It was also the WNBA's top audience ever on cable.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Bueckers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paige Bueckers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Comets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Comets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Deportes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN Deportes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Former-MVP-sounds-off-on-Caitlin-Clark-new-players-impact.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 2929, "textEnd": 2935}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Clark has since been drafted to the WNBA's Indiana Fever and the pressure on her is at a level very few have ever experienced. But one who has is Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James.\n\nLike Clark, LeBron came into the NBA with a ridiculous level of popularity and pressure as many expected him to dominate immediately. Clark has struggled some with the transition to the professional level, leading to some criticism and downright ridiculous suggestions in some cases, but LeBron is here for none of it.\n\nIn the latest episode of his Mind The Game podcast with JJ Redick, James discussed Clark, noting that she is gonna make some great things happen for the WNBA while adding that he hopes she ignores all of the hate and just goes out and has fun:\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing to her sport is more people want to watch. More people want to tune in. Don't get it twisted, don't get it f -- - up, Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things are gonna happen for the WNBA. But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said. Just go have fun, enjoy. But I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills, I hope Aliyah Boston does amazing, I hope they do great.\n\n\"You know I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching my son, who's a 19-year old, getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream. There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown ass men and women out here doing whatever they can to try and make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is and I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nThere aren't many who can relate to Clark on this level, but James is one of them and the Lakers star makes some excellent points. This is Clark living out her dreams and for many people to try and crash down on that is simply unfair.\n\nThe rise of social media has allowed for many people to say terrible things and post awful opinions while facing no repercussions. In the end, it is best for Clark to not give those people any of her energy and focus on living her dreams and being the best player she can be.\n\nWhile Caitlin Clark will be handling her business in the WNBA, LeBron James still has his own career to think about and some big decisions to make this offseason.\n\nJames could opt in to the final year of his contract with the Lakers or he could opt out and become an unrestricted free agent, free to sign with any team in the league, or simply re-sign with the Lakers on a new deal.\n\nAnd according to the latest rumors, all of these options remain on the table for LeBron as the offseason gets underway and the deadline for him to make his decision approaches.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_hansford@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Corey Hansford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Reddick. James, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, dealt with much media hype dating back to his high school days as a teenager. He sees Clark, the former Iowa women's basketball star, as someone who could help the WNBA grow.\n\n\"The one thing that I love that she's bringing to her sport is that more people want to watch, more people want to tune in,\" James said. \"Don't get it twisted, don't get it (expletive) up. Caitlin Clark is the reason a lot of great things are going to happen for the WNBA.\"\n\nAfter being a record-breaking player at Iowa, Clark was selected No. 1 overall by the Indiana Fever in the 2024 WNBA draft last month. Four games into her professional career, Clark is averaging 17.0 points, 5.5 assists, and 4.0 rebounds, but the Fever are off to a 0-4 start to the season.\n\nAs she adjusts from the college game, Clark has shot 41.2% from the field and just 34.3% from 3-point range. She averaged 28.4 points, 8.2 assists, and 7.1 rebounds per game with the Hawkeyes, including 31.6 points, 8.9 assists, and 7.4 rebounds as a senior last season on 46% shooting from the field and 38% from three.\n\nJames said he wants Clark to concentrate on her play and let the outside noise not impact her. He speaks from experience as someone who has dealt with the hype from the media and fans throughout his career, especially when he came into the league.\n\n\"But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said,\" James said. \"Just go have fun, enjoy.

James has seen his son, Bronny, deal with hype and high expectations from the media and fans. Bronny entered the 2024 NBA draft after averaging 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists on 37% shooting in his lone college season at USC.\n\nBronny, listed at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, dealt with adversity in his lone college season. Outside of being the son of one of the greatest players ever, Bronny was cleared by doctors for a full return to basketball four months after suffering a cardiac arrest in November.

Don't get it twisted, don't get it f-ked up, Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is going to happen for the WNBA,\" James, now 39, said.\n\n\"But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on nothing that's being said. Just go have fun, enjoy.\"\n\nClark -- the No. 1 overall pick by the Fever in the WNBA Draft in April -- has been under a microscope and at the center of praise and criticism four games into her pro career.\n\n\"But I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before,\" James said. \"I hope she kills it. I hope [Fever forward] Aliyah Boston [the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft] does amazing. I hope they do great.\n\n\"I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same, you know, thing from watching my son [Bronny James], who is a 19-year-old [going through the NBA draft process] kind of getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream. There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport.\n\n\"And we have grown ass men and women out here doing whatever they can to try to make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is. And I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nClark -- who led Iowa to two consecutive NCAA championship appearances in each of the last two seasons, and became the NCAA's Division I all-time leading scorer for men or women -- experienced a few \"welcome to the league\" moments during the Fever's 0-4 start.\n\nThe 22-year-old Clark has shown flashes of her deep shooting range, which made her arguably the greatest shooter in college basketball, across four games with Indiana, but she has much to work on in her rookie season.\n\nTurnovers have been an issue for Clark, who also needs to improve her mid-range game and ball-handling skills.\n\nRedick mentioned to James that there is \"a dislike or vitriol\" aimed at Clark from older players and how her opponents aren't exactly wrapping their arms around her.\n\nMercury star Diana Taurasi -- a three-time WNBA champion, two-time Finals MVP, 2009 league MVP and a 10-time All-Star, who is entering her 20th season -- ruffled some feathers when she said Clark would experience a learning curve at the pro level.\n\nIt was then used as fuel for a veteran and rookie rivalry with Taurasi and Clark.\n\nJames went on to explain that he wasn't welcomed with open arms to the NBA.\n\n\"There is video evidence of my teammates basically saying, 'he's not ready' or 'there is somebody playing this position' or 'we're not putting all of our faith in an 18-year-old kid' or 'all this hype, we've been here,'\" said James, who played the first seven seasons of his career with his hometown Cavaliers.\n\n\"So, my own teammates who I had to be on the floor with, practicing with, on the planes with, in the locker room, in game situations, that just had this kinda -- you don't want to say hate -- animosity towards me and what I can provide.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type":

The rookie sensation grimaced, limped gingerly to the sideline and slammed her hand on the bench before disappearing into the tunnel to the training room with 5:37 left in the half.\n\nThe crowd at Indianapolis' Gainbridge Fieldhouse gasped, then fell silent. A Monday-night ESPN audience held its collective breath. One can only imagine how WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert reacted.\n\nYou know who Clark is by now -- the ponytailed TV-ratings bonanza who set the NCAA's all-time scoring record -- for men and women -- and led the Iowa Hawkeyes to back-to-back championship game appearances.\n\nThe scoring record wasn't the only one she set. During her romp through the Big Ten and March Madness the last two seasons, highlighted by her trademark \"logo 3-pointers\" from more than 30 feet out and video-game scoring numbers, the Iowa Hawkeyes shattered both TV-ratings and attendance records. The women's championship game between Iowa and South Carolina in March averaged 18.9 million viewers -- outdrawing the men's title game for the first time ever. After the Fever made Clark the first pick in April's WNBA draft, the apparel site Fanatics reported that her jersey was the best-seller for any draft pick in history.\n\nYet, in the second quarter of a tightly contested game, Clark was out of public view and the game, somehow, went on. The winless Fever hung with the undefeated and veteran Sun, and even led 44-41 at halftime. For five minutes, the women's basketball world fretted and pondered the \"what-ifs.\"\n\nWhat if we have to go back to life without Caitlin Clark?\n\nA mere season ago, it took the Fever eight home games to draw more than 34,000 fans. This season, they've done it in two. For the first time in the league's 27-year history, three teams -- the two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces, the Atlanta Dream, and the Dallas Wings -- sold out their season-ticket allotment.\n\nTV ratings are booming and teams are moving to bigger venues to accommodate larger crowds for when Clark and the Fever come to town. And the league has agreed to have teams fly charter flights as opposed to commercial ones, which has been the standard practice since the league's 1997 inception.\n\nThe \"Caitlin Clark effect\" is real, make no mistake.\n\nBut, for a league that has seen its pendulum of popularity swing both directions, is it sustainable? Is it really real?\n\nOn Monday night, Clark had her sprained ankle taped, came out of halftime with her teammates and nearly led the Fever to its first win. She scored 17 points and hit the longest shot of her young career -- a 33-footer that put Indiana up 70-68 with 7:17 to play. The bucket elicited a deafening roar from the home crowd prompting ESPN scribe Alex Philippou to tweet the following:\n\nThe roars we're hearing aren't exactly unprecedented, but they do represent a resurgence. The WNBA commanded a fair amount of attention for much of its first decade, but the league had come to barely register a murmur in the mainstream sports headspace.\n\nThrough the league's first six seasons, when it boasted an average game attendance of more than 9,000, the U.S. economy boomed and financial investment flowed into the WNBA. It expanded from eight to 16 teams in those first years. But between 2003 and 2006, attendance reversed course, seemingly bottoming out in 2006 as the economy struggled. Owners of NBA franchises unhitched the WNBA wagons, and teams folded or relocated with new ownership, such as the Orlando Miracle -- previously owned by the Orlando Magic -- being sold to the Mohegan tribe and rebranding as the Connecticut Sun.\n\nThe newness had worn off and both private and media investment tapered.\n\nOn the bright side, attendance at WNBA games jumped to about 7,700 in 2007, though that number stayed largely flat for the next decade. Some franchises drifted through new ownership. Local TV deals were meh and national media provided the obligatory minimum.\n\nThe game didn't lack personalities or stars, though. Diana Taurasi, Candace Parker, Sue Bird, and Maya Moore provided plenty of highlight moments, but none broke into the mainstream sport media consciousness.\n\nThe pandemic proved to be a boon. The WNBA played all its games in a \"wubble\" at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, in the summer of 2020. The Seattle Storm, led by the ageless Bird, won the title.That shortened season coincided with that summer's racial justice protests in response to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and athletes' activism on race, gender, and sexuality generated more affirmative reactions for the WNBA than they did for the NFL.\n\nAnd so the league stormed out of the COVID era.\n\nVeterans Bird and Parker, as well as 2019 MVP Elena Delle Donne and Jonquel Jones, began to appear in national commercial campaigns. Young stars like A'ja Wilson and Sabrina Ionescu brought their skill, excitement, and a brash cockiness from the college ranks to the WNBA floor. TV ratings began to rise again.\n\nClark and a pack of self-confident, media-savvy ballers emerged in the college game at just the right time. Their name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals hit just as their social media prowess expanded -- and their games didn't let them down. They appeared in national commercial campaigns for Carmax, State Farm, Adidas, AT&T, and more. They developed high-profile rivalries that the media ate up. Clark herself doesn't have a huge social media presence, but her fellow stars Angel Reese of LSU, Paige Bueckers of UConn, and Juju Watkins of USC have followers numbering in the millions.\n\nThe networks reacted in kind. ESPN began to follow Clark and the Hawkeyes around the country, while also finding prime-time airspace for two Southeastern Conference juggernauts led by colorful coaches -- South Carolina (Dawn Staley) and LSU (Kim Mulkey). And don't think ESPN didn't notice: Clark and Reese square off for the first time as pros on June 1 in Indianapolis and ESPN's cameras will be there.\n\nFor long-time fans, something strange was happening: Women's basketball felt mainstream. For young fans, it is all they've ever known.\n\nIf you imbibe in sports radio or sports TV talk shows, Clark is barely living up to expectations. Her team hasn't won yet. She is inefficient and leads the league with 6.5 turnovers per game.\n\nNever mind that six weeks ago Clark played for the national championship, or that she has been with her new team for a mere three weeks. Forget that she is playing at a higher level on a team that has owned consecutive No. 1 draft picks -- you have to lose a lot of games to earn the first pick.\n\nNever mind that the Fever opened the season with four games in six nights, three of them televised nationally and all of them against teams that made it to at least the WNBA semifinals last season.\n\nNever mind that Clark is meeting with throngs of media before and after every game. She is signing autographs and taking selfies. She is in every TV promo regardless if you are watching the game on ESPN, CBS, ION or Amazon Prime.\n\nThere is plenty on the young woman's shoulders -- and she is still averaging 17 points and 5.5 assists per game.\n\nClark is going to be just fine but, ultimately, the popularity of the WNBA follows the money. If she keeps hitting those 3-pointers, fans keep watching.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Indiana Fever are now 0-4 to start the 2024 season, and now get another tough test on the road against the Seattle Storm (1-3).\n\nThe Fever do have a few factors going their way though. For one, this is Indiana's first game that is not against an undefeated team. Indiana's first four games were against the New York Liberty (4-0) and the Connecticut Sun (3-0). Not only that, but the Fever got progressively better throughout those four games. After losing their first two contests by a combined 57 points, the Fever lost their two most recent matchups by just 15 combined points. A win in Seattle would go a long way in helping the Fever get their season on track.\n\nThe Seattle Storm are no pushovers though. The Storm are very solid on the glass, having pulled down 34 rebounds (12 offensive) in their most recent game, a loss against the New York Liberty. They do have trouble holding onto the ball and coughed up 14 turnovers in the loss. Perhaps the Fever will take advantage. Of course, if Caitlin Clark's ankle injury persists, that will be much more difficult.\n\nHere's everything to know about this Wednesday night matchup.\n\nWNBA News: Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark injures ankle, but returns in loss to Connecticut Sun\n\nPicks and Parlays: Fever 75, Storm 74\n\nThomas Pemberton writes, \"The Indiana Fever have been playing better in each game so far this season. The Fever are hungry for a win and match up well in this game. Seattle has had their struggles as well during the early parts of the season. Watch for Caitlin Clark to take advantage of the Fever's second half possessions.\"\n\nTribLIVE: Storm 91, Fever 74\n\nTribLIVE is expecting somewhat of a blowout tonight. The point out that while the Fever have been playing better as of late, Jewell Loyd is still likely the best player on the court for either team, especially if Caitlin Clark is not at full strength.\n\nDimers: Storm to win\n\nMac Douglass writes, \"Our leading predictive analytics model currently gives the Storm a 75% chance of beating the Fever. Number one draft pick Caitlin Clark is expected to star as the Fever take on the Storm, with a projected 25 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 made threes.\"\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

He sees what she's going through with the weight of the sport placed firmly upon her shoulders like holding the globe. LeBron's been there as heir-apparent to Michael Jordan when he entered the league the same year Jordan retired.\n\nIn a sit down discussion with J.J. Reddick, LeBron James didn't dodge the discussion about Caitlin Clark for fear of angering WNBA veterans. Instead, he was crystal clear about how Caitlin Clark will be directly responsible for incredible things happening in the WNBA over the years to come.\n\nThe Caitlin Clark talk came 44 minutes into the latest episode of Mind the Game when charter flights / flying commercial got brought up. LeBron James didn't hold back. James said \"don't get it twisted, don't get it f -- - up. Caitlin Clark is the reason a lot of great things are going to happen to the WNBA.\" He had some interesting quotes immediately after as well:\n\nAs for the league veterans like Diana Taurasi who have been outspoken about Caitlin Clark's role in the WNBA, LeBron thinks Clark shouldn't involve herself in the war of words going on around her. LeBron said \"I don't think she should get involved in nothing that's being said. Just go have fun and enjoy (the season).\"\n\nLeBron then put the Indiana Fever's results into perspective. He astutely pointed out that this is the second year in a row Caitlin Clark's Indiana Fever had the #1 overall pick in the WNBA Draft. Saying \"you know what that means? That means they're not that good.\" Clark obviously needs some pieces around her and the Fever will get those as right now they have the biggest star the WNBA has ever seen.\n\nAfter that, LeBron said \"I hope (Caitlin Clark) kills. I hope Aliyah Boston does amazing. I hope they do great. I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching my son who is a 19-year-old getting a lot of animosity and hatred toward him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream and there's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing professional sports.\"\n\nEvidently, LeBron James is listening to the discourse about how Bronny James \"is not an NBA prospect\" but is receiving a lot of attention as one.\n\nThe full video can be seen here on YouTube.

Dennis pointed out that Victor Wembanyama's San Antonio Spurs went 22-60 during his highly successful rookie campaign.\n\nDennis believes the real issue is how everyone is overreacting to Indiana's sluggish start and \"coddling\" Clark.\n\n\"What is most harmful to Caitlin Clark is the way that so many people are babying her and acting like this is some national nightmare that she's losing games. ... It happens. She will be fine,\" Dennis said.\n\nThe Liberty eliminated the Sun in last year's semifinals, and they're both undefeated in this season's opening week. Facing two top-tier opponents, Indiana responded to blowout losses with more competitive rematches.\n\nThe Fever played their best game of 2024 in Monday night's 88-84 loss to the Sun. Clark was disappointed but encouraged by their performance.\n\n\"I think you could see the progress we're making, and that's why this one hurts a lot,\" Clark told reporters after the game, via ESPN. \"We were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game, and then you don't. ... It's going to be a fun season. We got to remember, we've played two of the top teams in the league, and we were right there with the Sun tonight.\"\n\nIndiana can crack the win column when facing the Seattle Storm on Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Horn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Around the Horn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/6a/36ad1126-0166-5c32-b81f-2b2a599f5721/664d37f9d91dd.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

I've walked that road before.'\n\nSean Leahy\n\nMay 22, 2024 at 5:45 PM\n\nCaitlin Clark has learned that success in the WNBA won't come quickly after a decorated collegiate career at Iowa.\n\nThe Indiana Fever are tied for last in the league at 0-4 while Clark is leading her team in minutes (31 per game), points (17 pg) , assists (5.5 pg), as well as turnovers (6.5 pg).\n\nClark's celebrated entrance into the league was not embraced by some of the game's veteran players. Three-time WNBA champion and MVP Diana Taurasi said in April that \"reality\" is coming -- not just for Clark, but also incoming rookies.\n\n\"There's levels to this thing and that's just life,\" Taurasi said. \"We all went through it. You see it on the NBA side, and you're going to see it on this side where you look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you're going to come with some grown women who have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\"\n\nThat's life as a rookie in any sport. Most players Clark played against at Iowa won't go on to be professionals. There was always going to be an adjustment period going from a team that reached consecutive national title games to a one that had won only 30 out of its last 130 games entering the 2024 season.\n\nOne athlete who can relate to the pressures to succeed right away is LeBron James. The 2003 No. 1 overall NBA draft pick was pegged to change the game at age 18 while his high school games were still being broadcast on ESPN.\n\nOn the latest edition of the \"Mind the Game\" podcast featuring James and J.J. Redick, the Los Angeles Lakers star had some simple advice for Clark as she goes through this early period of her professional career.\n\n\"My advice to Caitlin, and my advice to anyone that comes in with this level of notoriety, out-of-this-world expectation, whatever the case may be, be a horse, man,\" James said. \"The Kentucky Derby. Put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft.\n\n\"Kind of keep your mouth shut and just learn from the vets. When they ask, voice your opinion if they want your opinion early on because everybody is looking for you to say anything and they're gonna splice it and cut it and make it a negative thing.\n\n\"The one thing I love that she's bringing to her sport: More people want to watch. More people want to tune in. ... Don't get it twisted, don't get it f**ked up. Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things is gonna happen for the WNBA. ... I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before. I've walked that road before. I hope she kills.\"\n\nJames tied the criticism Clark is getting in some corners of the basketball world to that that has been directed at his son, Bronny, who is expected to selected in next month's NBA draft.\n\nBronny James played 23 games for USC during his freshman season and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. He's expected to be a second-round pick.\n\n\"I'm just kind of in this mode right now because I'm getting the same thing from watching my son, who's a 19-year-old getting a lot of animosity and hatred towards him when he's just a kid trying to live out his dream,\" James said.\n\nLike Clark and the WNBA, Bronny James will enter the NBA with expectations. For Clark, it was that she would immediately dominate like she did in college. For Bronny James, he'll be unfairly compared with his father on a nightly basis.\n\nBut as LeBron sees in his son and what he sees from afar with Clark, both are handling this transitional period by ignoring the noise and just playing.\n\n\"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport,\" James added. \"And we have grown a** men and women out here doing whatever they can to try and make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is and I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_leahy@aol.com", "name": "Sean Leahy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lr0Xf.UJY3pZ2Zm0JgJ4uw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/108239608826d6cd36eef0d69a6fb1b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

While Clark is averaging a solid 17 points per game, her overall peformance over her first four professional contests has been mixed. However, Clark and the rest of the league's hotly anticipated crop of rookies are still bringing unprecedented viewership and popularity to the WNBA.\n\nThat has also come with some criticism, with some in and around the league voicing resentment or wanting to diminish the fact that Clark is driving this popularity instead of stars like two-time defending MVP A'ja Wilson. But LeBron James, who knows a thing or two about being the face of a basketball league, took aim at Clark's critics during the most recent episode of his podcast, \"Mind The Game,\" with J.J. Redick.\n\n\"Don't get it twisted, don't get it f---ed up,\" James said. \"Caitlin Clark is the reason why a lot of great things are gonna happen for the WNBA. But for her individually, I don't think she should get involved on [anything] that's being said, just go have fun, enjoy. I'm rooting for Caitlin because I've been in that seat before, I've walked that road before. I hope she kills, I hope [Fever teammate] Aliyah Boston does amazing. I hope they do great.\"\n\nJames also compared the scrutiny that the 22-year-old Clark is under to the spotlight currently shining on his 19-year-old son, Bronny James, who is expected to be a first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Bronny does not profile as the top overall prospect in the draft, but is the most bet to to No. 1 overall amid reports that LeBron would join whichever team Bronny goes to in order to live out his stated dream of playing on the same NBA team as his son.\n\n\"He's just a kid trying to live out his dream,\" LeBron said of his son. \"There's a very small number of men and women that actually get to live out their dream of playing a professional sport. And we have grown a-- men and women doing whatever they can to try to make sure that does not happen. That is the weirdest thing in the world, but it is what it is, and I'm glad that Caitlin has a great head on her shoulders.\"\n\nJames and Redick also shared a brief chuckle over the rampant rumors that the latter is the favorite to the the former's next head coach with the Los Angeles Lakers, with the two laughing after Redick alluded to the rumors by talking about \"other things happening in the NBA World, non-playoff related,\" that he thinks are being \"used for content.\" Redick currently holds the shortest betting odds to be named the next Lakers head coach.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1408/814/LeBronCaitlin.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The milestone highlights the attention surrounding Clark's transition from a college sensation at Iowa to a professional draw in the WNBA. During the game, Clark delivered a solid performance, scoring 22 points, providing eight assists and grabbing six rebounds. Despite the Fever's 0-4 start to the season, Clark's presence on the court continues to attract attention.\n\nThe opening weekend doubleheader in all had 1.5 million average viewers, a 143% increase from 2023's season average on ABC.\n\nCaitlin Clark's game vs. New York Liberty peaked at nearly 2 million viewers\n\nClark's WNBA regular season debut May 14 against the Connecticut Sun had already set a precedent by becoming the most-watched WNBA game in 22 years, with ESPN PR reporting it as the most-watched WNBA game on network platforms in league history. This trend of high viewership followed Clark from her college days, where she led the Iowa Hawkeyes to record-breaking viewership numbers, including a peak of 17 million viewers during their Final Four victory over UConn.\n\nThe Fever vs. Liberty game not only set records for ABC but also served as a strong lead-in for the subsequent match-up between the defending champion Las Vegas Aces and the Los Angeles Sparks. That game attracted an average of 1.34 million viewers, peaking at 1.55 million, making it the third most-watched WNBA game on ABC ever.\n\nABC's successful doubleheader, featuring the four WNBA teams, was a significant boost for the network. The pre-game coverage under the \"WNBA Countdown\" banner saw a 45% increase in viewership compared to last year's season average on ABC, pulling in 714,000 viewers.\n\nESPN, which provides production and talent services for ABC, highlighted the impressive ratings. Despite being available on free broadcast television, the Fever-Liberty game recorded slightly lower viewership than the season opener on ESPN, which garnered 2.1 million viewers across cable and streaming platforms, including Disney Plus and ESPN Plus.\n\nIn related news, the highly anticipated matchup between Clark and Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese will be broadcast on a larger platform. The clash between these two former college hoops superstars will be broadcast on ESPN instead of NBA TV as originally scheduled. The June 1 game between Clark's Indiana Fever and Reese's Sky was flexed to ESPN, a move that is expected to draw significant attention from fans of both players.\n\nThe Fever, currently facing tough competition, will look to secure their first win of the season against the Seattle Storm on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caitlin-Clarks-Fever-game-vs.-Liberty-sparks-record-ratings.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 726, "textEnd": 732}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2382, "textEnd": 2388}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

I don't have the best ankles in the world. It was a little tight this morning, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"It felt good, I just wanted to get a lot more tape on it as fast as I could to get back out there playing. It's hard, especially when I felt I started the game off good, then you get hurt and you've got to sit out the last five minutes of the first half, then wait for halftime.\n\n\"It's hard to get into a flow so I think it took me until the end of the third quarter to get back into a little bit of a flow, but every basketball player has had an ankle injury. If not, you're not a true baller I guess, so it'll be a little stiff but I'll be good.\"\n\nDespite the Fever starting the season 0-4 after a tough schedule, Monday's defeat was certainly the team's most encouraging performance so far.\n\nAn electric sequence that began with Aliyah Boston making a block and ended with Clark hitting a deep logo three-pointer in transition gave the Fever a 70-68 lead with 7:16 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I think it was a big shot,\" Clark said. \"It gave us some momentum, got the crowd going. Our crowd was incredible, our fans were incredible.\"\n\nHowever, missed shots down the stretch and continued turnovers meant the Fever was unable to see out its first win of the season.\n\nA frustrated Clark was also given a technical foul after telling a referee in no uncertain terms that she should have earned a foul call on a layup in the closing minutes.\n\n\"I think you can see the progress that this team is making and that's why this one hurts a lot, because we were right there and we had plenty of opportunities to go win the game - and then you don't,\" Clark added.\n\n\"It's just some little things that we do to ourselves.\"\n\nConnecticut, now 3-0 to start the season, was led by a monster night from Alyssa Thomas, who finished with 24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, all game-high marks.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matias_grez@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Matias Grez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_sports_articles_205/9f2d9675959cfa277e1fa53532f08bc0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Though Clark hasn't said anything to fuel the Black-white narrative surrounding her meteoric rise, talks about a double standard are being had.\n\n\"I think it's a huge thing. I think a lot of people may say it's not about Black and white, but to me, it is,\" Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson said when asked about the race element in Clark's popularity and before she recently signed two major endorsement deals. \"It really is because you can be top notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that's something that people don't want to see.\n\n\"They don't see it as marketable, so it doesn't matter how hard I work. It doesn't matter what we all do as Black women, we're still going to be swept underneath the rug. That's why it boils my blood when people say it's not about race because it is.\"\n\nTo be clear, Clark is a skilled hardcourt savant from Iowa. Bird was a skilled hardcourt savant from Indiana State. And like Bird, Clark has captivated audiences and brought unmatched attention to women's basketball with an ability to score from every corner of the court.\n\nNeither Bird nor Clark were the first great white male or female pro basketball players. Jerry West is the actual NBA logo and before Clark, the long list of talented white WNBA players included Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart.\n\nBut sports can be elevated by a heated rivalry, particularly when race is involved.\n\nClark's rise has come with an on-court bravado that made her must-watch TV as she led the Hawkeyes to back-to-back NCAA championship game appearances. When Bird led the Sycamores to the title game in 1979, he squared off against Magic Johnson in one of the most-watched games in NCAA tourney history.\n\nAt Iowa, Clark's on-court rival in the NCAA Tournament was former LSU star Angel Reese. Then she took on women's juggernaut South Carolina and coach Dawn Staley. The matchups created the kind of made-for-social media moments that captivated audiences, regardless of gender.\n\nThe matchups also led to ongoing discussions about how race plays a factor in the treatment afforded to Clark, a white woman from \"America's Heartland,\" as compared to Black counterparts like Reese.\n\nClark has said she and Reese are just pieces of a larger movement.\n\n\"I would say me and Angel have always been great competitors,\" Clark said prior to Iowa's Elite Eight matchup with Reese and LSU in March. \"I think Angel would say the same, like it's not just us in women's basketball. That's not the only competitive thing about where our game is at, and that's what makes it so good. We need multiple people to be really good.\"\n\nStill, the race-based debate over perceived slights to Black players or favoritism toward Clark is not going away as the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft prepares for her first regular-season game on Tuesday night when Indiana plays Connecticut.\n\n\"I think new fans, or maybe returning fans to women's college basketball, have been drawn in. In part because of Clark. But also, you know, because of the LSU-Iowa rivalry,\" said Victoria Jackson, a sports historian and clinical associate professor of history at Arizona State University.\n\n\"There are basketball reasons,\" Jackson said, \"but also there are racial reasons for why Clark has been able to kind of break off into a completely different stratosphere from players that came before her.\"\n\nBecause of the perceived double-standard, nearly everything involving Clark gets questioned:\n\n-- Clark's first preseason game was streamed, but Reese's was not.\n\n-- Clark gets an endorsement deal. Other established Black stars not so much.\n\n-- If Reese talks trash, it's viewed as unsportsmanlike. If Clark does it, she's being competitive.\n\n-- Reese received some backlash for going to the Met Gala before a game, raising questions would there have been same type of scrutiny if Clark had graced the red carpet.\n\nWilson, who signed with Gatorade last week and announced Saturday that she is getting a Nike signature shoe, and others have cited how companies are clamoring to be in business with Clark as an example of the disparity in how players are treated.\n\nThe deal Clark struck with Nike will reportedly pay her $28 million over eight years -- making it the richest sponsorship contract for a women's basketball player, and it includes a signature shoe. Before Wilson's announcement Saturday, the only other active players in the WNBA with a signature shoe were Elena Delle Donne, Sabrina Ionescu and Stewart - who are all white.\n\nThe perception extends beyond endorsements.\n\nWhile Clark's preseason debut was available on the WNBA League Pass streaming app, a post on the X platform from the WNBA incorrectly stated that all games, including the debut of Reese and fellow rookie former South Carolina standout Kamilla Cardoso for the Chicago Sky, would also be available.\n\nSo, a fan in attendance at the Sky's game livestreamed it. It received more than 620,000 views.\n\nIn an apology post explaining why the Sky's game wasn't also available, the WNBA said Clark's game was available as part of a limited free preview of its streaming app.\n\nThere also have been racial components to how Clark is treated on social media as compared to others, most notably Reese.\n\nReese, who has previously spoken about the vitriol she received online, was recently attacked again after she missed a preseason practice to attend the Met Gala. Clark also has been the target of online criticism, but apparently not to the extent that Reese has been.\n\nOnline hate-speech accounts for approximately 1 percent of all social media posts in the context of sports, according to Daniel Kilvington, course director in Media & Cultural Studies at Leeds Beckett University in Leeds, England.\n\n\"Although this might sound quite low, consider how much traffic is online and how many posts are made every single day,\" said Kilvington, whose work with the Tackling Online Hate in Football research group has looked at the issue through the sport of soccer. \"One percent is therefore 1% too high as athletes are primary targets of hate-speech, harassment and death threats simply for playing a game they love.\"\n\nBut as Clark's popularity grows, so will the debate. Jackson believes it's a good time to openly have discussions about it.\n\n\"I don't know how many times I read and heard her described as generational talent,\" the ASU professor said. \"And whenever we're making those cases, I immediately think, well, who are the other generational talents we've had? And, I think too often the athletes could be placed in that category who have been Black women have not had that sort of gushing attention. And especially the kind of general public, crossover saturation that Caitlin Clark has had.\n\n\"There are overlapping, intersecting reasons for why that is. But, I think we can't not think about it if the goal here is to have equitable treatment of the athletes in the sport.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"},

Thomas picked Clark's pocket, but likely fouled to do so.\n\nAs Thomas shoveled the basketball off to Sun guard Tyasha Harris, Clark committed a transition take foul.

I feel like I'll definitely be ready to go and ready to play,\" Clark said. \"Luckily I've dealt with some ankle injuries before so it's nothing really out of the ordinary.\"\n\nClark missed the final 5\u00bd minutes of the first half against the Sun after injuring the ankle on a screen. She returned in the second half and finished with 17 points and five assists, but the Fever dropped to 0-4 with the 88-84 loss.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nClark said she plans to tape up the ankle and hope the adrenaline will help get rid of any lingering soreness.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nShe's also hoping a return to Seattle can spark the Fever. Wednesday's game against the Storm will be the third time Clark will play inside Climate Pledge Arena. She played two games here with Iowa during the 2023 NCAA Women's Tournament, including a 41-point, 10-rebound, 12-assist triple-double in the regional final against Louisville that sent the Hawkeyes to the Final Four.\n\nClark said that trip to Seattle seemed to be the start of the latest surge in notoriety and attention that has followed women's hoops.\n\n\"I think that's kind of when the fandom of Iowa women's basketball really started and you kind of started to see women's basketball really take off,\" Clark said. \"I'd never been to Seattle in my life and then coming here we didn't really know what to expect, we didn't know how our fans would travel, we didn't know really much. But just to see the support of women's basketball, whether it was us playing, whether it was other teams playing, I think that was the biggest thing when I came here and noticed that.\n\n\"This arena was packed. There wasn't a seat that was open coming here and I felt like that weekend was definitely a step forward for women's basketball.\"\n\nWNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This happens,\" Dennis said of Clark, whose Fever dropped their fourth straight game Monday with an 88-84 loss to the Connecticut Sun.\n\nHe then cited online vitriol aimed at Clark's Fever teammate, Aliyah Boston, as the losses pile up.\n\n\"It's four games, you don't become a No. 1 pick for a team that has two years straight of No. 1 picks without going to a bad team, who has played the [4-0] New York Liberty twice,\" Dennis said of Indiana, which drafted Boston No. 1 overall out of South Carolina last year.\n\n\"Of course 0-4 is expected, they've got the Seattle Storm (1-3) next. This team is not going to win a lot of games, that has never really been the metric for No. 1 draft picks. Most times they come to bad teams, they lose a lot of games.\"\n\nClark, 22, arrived at Indiana with much fanfare following a prolific career at Iowa, where she became the NCAA's all-time leading scorer and made two back-to-back national championship appearances.\n\nDuring Tuesday's discussion, Dennis also referenced another first-overall pick, NBA Rookie of the Year Victor Wembanyama, who experienced a 22-60 campaign with the Spurs in his first season in San Antonio.\n\n\"Victor Wembanyama in the NBA just lost 17 games in a row and nobody is talking about that being some sort of bad thing for him, that's part of the process,\" he said.\n\nThrough four games, Clark has averaged 17 points per contest, along with four rebounds and 5.5 assists.\n\nWith 36 games remaining on the

But the hype and pomp around her has also estranged the 22-year-old from many seasoned veterans of the game. LeBron James also suffered a similar treatment when he began his NBA journey as 'The Chosen One'. Therefore, he had some potent advice for Clark to get over the cold looks from the people around her.\n\nOn the recent episode of Mind the Game pod, JJ Redick brought up how Clark has been dealing with a lot of \"dislike\" and \"vitriol\" from the experienced WNBA players. LBJ could relate to Clark's predicament immediately and recalled how he faced \"animosity\" from his teammates when he began his NBA journey.\n\n\"My own teammates that I had to be like on the floor with, practicing with, on the planes with, in the locker room, in game situations, had this kinda, you don't wanna say hate but just like animosity towards me,\" James told Redick.\n\nLeBron found this attitude strange because he wanted to \"learn from the vets\" and didn't approach them with the arrogance of 'The Chosen One'. However, he still had to deal with it tactfully.\n\nTherefore, he rolled out a spot-on advice for the Indian Fever guard to mitigate her plight. The four-time NBA Champion advised her to remain focused and not waver from putting in the work.\n\n\"Be a horse man, the Kentucky derby, put your blinders on. Go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself. Work on your game, work on your craft, kinda keep your mouth shut and learn from the vets,\" James advised Clark.\n\nThe NBA's All-Time NBA Leading Scorer kept emphasizing about Clark's need to stay mum to avoid feeding narratives to her detractors, who can \"splice it up\" to suit their agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, he also hailed Clark for bringing so much more attention to the WNBA and highlighted how the league has now started arranging \"chartered flights\" for the first time in its history. While these words are bound to motivate the Iowa Hawkeyes legend, her work in the WNBA will not be easy.\n\nIn the first four games of her WNBA career, Caitlin Clark has averaged 17.1 points , 5.5 assists, and 4 rebounds per game.

While some are pressing the panic button, some others think that's the worst thing you could do right now.\n\nOn ESPN's Around the Horn, writer David Dennis Jr. explained why people are doing a disservice to Clark and the Fever by acting like this 0-4 start is a \"national nightmare.\"\n\n\"The thing here for Caitlin Clark is it's four games! You don't become a No. 1 pick for a team that has two years straight of No. 1 picks without going to a bad team that has played the New York Liberty twice. Of course 0-4 is expected,\" Dennis said. \"They've got the Seattle Storm next. This team is not going to win a lot of games. That has never really been the metric for No. 1 draft picks. Most of the time they come to bad teams. They lose a lot of games.\"\n\nDennis Jr. then compared Clark to San Antonio Spurs rookie star Victor Wembanyama, who lost 17 games in a row with the team in his first year. But there wasn't any national discussion on that.\n\n\"What is most harmful to Caitlin Clark is the way that so many people are babying her and acting like this is some national nightmare that she's losing games,\" Dennis said.

The deal between Clark and Wilson is a historic one, because the WNBA star joins Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan as the only other athlete to have a collaboration with the company.\n\nClark spoke with Boardroom about the collaboration and what it means to her.\n\n\"I loved that thing more than anything. My brothers and I would always fight over it,\" Clark told Boardroom of the Wilson ball she used growing up. \"That was the best basketball. But I'm just super excited to have a collaboration and create basketballs together that are really cool.

The game between Clark's Indiana Fever and the Connecticut Sun drew a staggering 1.56 million viewers, marking a 353-percent increase over last year's average. The game even peaked at 2.97 million viewers, making it the most-watched WNBA game in ESPN history.\n\nFlora Kelly, ESPN's VP of Research, expressed her excitement, stating, \"Last night's Sun/Fever hit 1.56M -+353% vs. last season's ESPN (E1) average. It peaked with 2.97M viewers from 9:00pm - 9:14pm. This is now the most-viewed WNBA game ever on ESPN.\" The numbers speak for themselves, highlighting the growing popularity of the league and the appeal of rising stars like Caitlin Clark.\n\nSome lighthearted speculation suggested that the peak viewership might have been influenced by hockey fans initially tuning in for the NHL playoff games on ESPN, only to switch channels upon realizing they weren't there. Regardless, it's clear that the WNBA is attracting attention and captivating audiences.\n\nThe surge in viewership aligns with the league's current status, boasting some of the most talented and respected players in recent memory. The WNBA has evolved to showcase exceptional skill and athleticism, drawing in fans from all over.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that sustained high ratings may depend on the performance of teams like the Indiana Fever. Despite Clark's impressive displays, the team has struggled, currently holding a 0-4 record with three losses by double digits. While Clark continues to dazzle on the court, it may take time for her individual brilliance to translate into team success, and this could potentially impact future ratings.\n\nCaitlin Clark's impact on the WNBA is undeniable, as evidenced by the remarkable surge in viewership. As the league continues to feature top-tier talent and competitive matchups, there's no doubt that fans will be eagerly tuning in to witness the excitement unfold. However, the Fever's performance will be a key factor in maintaining this momentum, and only time will tell how it will affect the league's viewership moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/95aaa161a2bfa5a689f36157b6ff58a8/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/22/17163412397787.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

She was called for a technical, too, when she shouted at the refs in frustration and the Sun took full advantage.\n\nConnecticut tied the score when DaWanna Bonner made one of two free throws, took the lead 46 seconds later on Harris' three-point play, made it 82-78 on Harris' 3 with 2:04 to go and broke an 84-84 tie with two more free throws from Harris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndiana had a chance to tie the score but, Aliyah Boston missed a layup in the waning seconds and Thomas closed it out with two free throws.\n\nBonner had 22 points and DiJonai Carrington scored 13 for the Sun.\n\nKelsey Mitchell matched Clark's numbers with 17 points and five assists, while Nalyssa Smith scored 13 and Temi Fagbenle added 11 points and 10 rebounds. Boston scored 10.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@manilatimes.net", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyasha_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyasha Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiJonai_Carrington", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DiJonai Carrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Boston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temi_Fagbenle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temi Fagbenle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWanna_Bonner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeWanna Bonner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/05/21/348496.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 485, "textEnd": 491}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

I've walked that road before.'", "body": "Caitlin Clark has learned that success in the WNBA won't come quickly after a decorated collegiate career at Iowa.\n\nThe Indiana Fever are tied for last in the league at 0-4 while Clark is leading her team in minutes (31 per game), points (17 pg) , assists (5.5 pg), as well as turnovers (6.5 pg).\n\nClark's celebrated entrance into the league was not embraced by some of the game's veteran players. Three-time WNBA champion and MVP Diana Taurasi said in April that \"reality\" is coming -- not just for Clark, but also incoming rookies.\n\nThat's life as a rookie in any sport. Most players Clark played against at Iowa won't go on to be professionals. There was always going to be an adjustment period going from a team that reached consecutive national title games to a one that had won only 30 out of its last 130 games entering the 2024 season.\n\nOne athlete who can relate to the pressures to succeed right away is LeBron James. The 2003 No. 1 overall NBA draft pick was pegged to change the game at age 18 while his high school games were still being broadcast on ESPN.\n\nOn the latest edition of the \"Mind the Game\" podcast featuring James and J.J. Redick, the Los Angeles Lakers star had some simple advice for Clark as she goes through this early period of her professional career.\n\nJames tied the criticism Clark is getting in some corners of the basketball world to that that has been directed at his son, Bronny, who is expected to selected in next month's NBA draft.\n\nBronny James played 23 games for USC during his freshman season and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. He's expected to be a second-round pick.\n\nLike Clark and the WNBA, Bronny James will enter the NBA with expectations. For Clark, it was that she would immediately dominate like she did in college. For Bronny James, he'll be unfairly compared with his father on a nightly basis.\n\nBut as LeBron sees in his son and what he sees from afar with Clark, both are handling this transitional period by ignoring the noise and just playing.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iDslujo7sV8LjDL3x72Cjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/06677f20-1849-11ef-bfdf-4b3b0d7a07d1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This remarkable milestone surpasses the previous record set by the Phoenix Mercury at the Connecticut Sun game on May 22, 2004.\n\nVisit streaming.thesource.com for more information\n\nViewership peaked at 2.3 million between 7:45 p.m. and 7:59 p.m., highlighting the widespread excitement surrounding Clark's entrance into the league.

Waiting for them on the West Coast is the Seattle Storm.\n\nSeattle has also come up short of lofty offseason expectations, starting 1-3 SU (2-2 ATS) as the Storm work big-name additions Skylar Diggins-Smith and Nneka Ogwumike in the lineup. Despite those woes (and Ogwumike listed as questionable), Seattle is laying six points inside Climate Pledge Arena tonight.\n\nI size up Aliyah Boston's impact for this non-conference clash and give my best WNBA picks and Fever at Storm predictions on May 22.\n\nLast year's Rookie of the Year is struggling to find her way in this new offensive setup and is coming off a 10-point effort against Connecticut in which she missed what would have been a game-tying layup in the final seconds.\n\nDespite her scoring struggles, Boston is still battling on the boards. She pulled down eight rebounds in the loss to the Sun -- a season-high through the first four games.\n\nShe'll have ample opportunities on the glass tonight, with the Storm playing a much quicker pace than those past opponents and attempting the fourth most field goals in the league. Seattle doesn't have the size and depth in the frontcourt like New York and Connecticut and has given up the fourth-most rebounds per game (36.5) to start the year.\n\nBoston's projections range from 9.4 to 10.3 rebounds, with my number coming in just shy of 9.5 rebounds from the All-Star forward. And due to her slow start to 2024, Boston's rebounding total sits at 8.5 Over/Under.\n\nGiven my forecast, the Over 8.5 boards for Boston should be priced around -135. But if you shop around on Wednesday morning, you can find that same proposition at +110.\n\nAfter taking on the veteran cores of New York and Connecticut, Caitlin Clark faces a familiar foe in Seattle tonight.\n\nStorm rookie Nika Muhl is expected to make her WNBA debut after visa issues sidelined the Croatian for the first four games of the season. Muhl made waves in the NCAA Tournament -- and upped her draft stock -- with her relentless defense on Clark in the women's Final Four. Clark shot just 7 for 18 in that game and scored 21 points in a two-point Iowa victory. Muhl did a great job forcing the ball out of Clark's hands, which resulted in seven assists for the Hawkeyes' star.\n\nClark has shown her passing flare in the past four games, averaging 5.5 assists and also watching numerous set-ups wasted due to poor shooting from her Fever teammates.\n\nMonday's loss to the Sun saw Clark miss minutes due to an ankle injury in the first half, getting only 27 minutes of floor time. She finished with five assists -- all coming in the fourth quarter.\n\nHer assist prop is at 6.5 Over/Under tonight, and given that this game will have a much quicker tempo than the past four games, there will be more shots and, therefore, more opportunities for assists. The Storm have allowed a league-high 22 assists against so far this spring.\n\nPlayer projections six right around six dimes from Clark but given the uptick in tempo and Indiana's others not letting Clark's assists die on the vine, I see a higher ceiling. Luckily, the Over 6.5 dimes is paying even money as of Wednesday morning.\n\nBoston is still battling on the boards, and tonight's game will have a quicker tempo and more shot attempts -- AKA rebounding chances -- than the past four games.\n\nClark's playmaking is picking up, and this should be an up-and-down game with plenty of buckets -- at least seven coming from Clark's passing.\n\nMy ratings listed Seattle as a 7-point favorite, and line movement suggests Nneka Ogwumike is back for the Storm. We'll take Seattle outright.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\n* Some sportsbooks opened Seattle as short as -4.5 but other shops hit the board as high as -6. The market consensus has ticked up, with shops dealing the Storm as high as -6.5 on Wednesday morning.\n\n* My WNBA power ratings produced an unadjusted spread of Seattle -7, but with Ogwumike listed as questionable after missing the last two games with an ankle injury, you can see why the spread opened lower.\n\n* The Over/Under for Wednesday's contest opened as high as 166.5 O/U at some books. That slimmed to 164 points before coming back up to 164.5 on Wednesday morning. Indiana is 2-2 O/U to start the season, while Seattle is 1-3 O/U.\n\n* According to Covers Consensus data, 54% of picks are taking the points with the Fever while 61% of total picks are siding with the Over.\n\nThe Over is 5-2 in the Indiana Fever's last seven games against Western Conference opponents.

Exploring The WNBA Superstar's Family Tree - The SportsRush", "body": "May 18, 2024; Brooklyn, New York, USA; Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) applauds while looking at the scoreboard in the third quarter against the New York Liberty at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCaitlin Clark has given rise to several fairytale stories on her way to reach the WNBA. However, all was not rosy in her personal life, with speculations surrounding her parents' potential divorce spreading like wildfire. This became a key area of interest amongst the youngster's followers, drawing unwanted attention to her astounding journey.\n\nContrary to the noise, her parents; Brent Clark, and Anne Nizzi-Clark; are still together. Not only is the couple moving strong, but they also remain the biggest supporters of their daughter. Consequently, they were spotted together in the stands during the Indiana Fever star's WNBA debut against Connecticut Sun [per ESPN].\n\nThe initial speculation had sparked from one of Clark's NCAA Tournament games against West Virginia Mountaineers on March 25. During that clash, her parents, who used to sit beside one another, sat apart in the arena. This caught the eyes of the basketball fans, prompting them to question the marital status of her guardians on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nDespite their unusual seating arrangement on this occasion, there seems to be no validity to the rumor. As a result, they continue to raise their three children together. Notably, each of their kids has excelled in sports, making a name for themselves as athletes.\n\nTheir oldest child, Blake, played football as a quarterback for Iowa State University from 2019 to 2022. Their second child, Caitlin, continues to set new benchmarks in the world of basketball. The youngest, Colin, followed in her sister's footsteps, playing basketball for Dowling Catholic High School until he graduated last spring.\n\nBrent played basketball and baseball as a college athlete while representing Simpson College in Iowa from 1985 to 1988. He even earned First Team and Second Team All-Conference honors in college basketball, hinting at his prowess as a former player. Thus, his active contributions were also likely crucial in his children's journey.\n\nFor the Fever guard, in particular, her father's input has been invaluable in her career. Brent coached her from a young age, preparing Clark for the adversities of senior-level basketball. Without a shadow of a doubt, his methods have paid immense dividends, with the 22-year-old spearheading a transformation in the women's circuit.\n\nSo, looking back on the journey, Brent became emotional during a 2023 interview with KCRG-TV9. \"I see a lot of myself at times in Caitlin in terms of her passion for the game. All in all, that's really what drives her and makes her the player that she is,\" he mentioned upon reflecting on her growth.\n\nAs a result, her parents continue to serve as the pillars of her success. Both on and off the court, they keep on guiding Clark through her hardships. So, with the basketball star taking baby steps into the unknown, she needs her guardians by her side more than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, the rumors about their divorce easing off in the last few weeks help Clark immensely in this regard. Now, she can focus her head on the game, as she continues to adjust to the demands of the WNBA.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sourav_bose@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Sourav Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Mountaineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia Mountaineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowling_Catholic_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dowling Catholic High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simpson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/f0d2fd31-untitled-design-2024-05-22t094039.978.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1028, "textEnd": 1036}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The Liberty became the first team in WNBA history to have more than $2 million in ticket revenue for a single game in it's opener.\n\nIn all, there were 10 sellouts during the league's opening week.\n\nRatings have been historic.

Figures for the network's opening games last season were not immediately available. NBA TV chipped in a 0.06 and 108,000 for Dream-Mercury and a 0.06 an 101,000 for Sky-Wings on Saturday night.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmediawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Media Watch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_lewis@sportsmediawatch.com", "name": "Jon Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Usatsi-23311262-scaled-e1716304313649.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

They've just taken the baton from '97 and just bringing us forward. Just very thankful for their skill, just how they're handling themselves and the media. It's just bringing us along.\"\n\nPlenty of WNBA players--such as Diana Taurasi--have gotten a fair share of backlash for seemingly being jealous of the new players rather than being appreciative of their contributions to further promote the league. With that being said, it's certainly nice to see a legend like Charles give the Indiana Fever rookie and the others the recognition they deserve.\n\nCharles' comments have merits as well. The WNBA has seen a massive increase in ticket sales and viewership because of the new players, and they are now riding the wave.\n\nNow, hopes are high that it can continue with Clark, Reese and the new generation leading the way.\n\nRelated: Dwyane Wade Issues Four-Word Take On Angel Reese's Caitlin Clark Trolling", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/89/089864bb-dbd5-5709-b6f7-c559ae1ede49/664bce4897e1c.image.jpg?crop=1044%2C548%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

LeBron James tells her how", "body": "WNBA. Caitlin Clark has more national TV games than Magic's Paolo Banchero, and he's OK with it\n\nLos Angeles Lakers icon and NBA legend LeBron James recently imparted some valuable wisdom to up-and-coming WNBA star Caitlin Clark. During an episode of the Mind the Game Pod with JJ Redick, James shared his insights on how to handle immense pressure and high expectations in the sports world.\n\nIn the podcast, James advised Clark and other athletes facing similar circumstances to adopt a focused and diligent approach, saying: \"My advice to Caitlin, and my advice to anyone that comes in with this level of notoriety, out-of-this-world expectation, whatever the case may be, be a horse, man. The Kentucky Derby. Put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft.\" This analogy emphasizes the importance of staying committed and dedicated to their craft despite external pressures.\n\nFurthermore, James emphasized the significance of learning from experienced players and being mindful of their public statements. He advised: \"Kind of keep your mouth shut and just learn from the vets. When they ask, voice your opinion if they want your opinion early because everybody is looking for you to say anything and they're gonna splice it and cut it and make it a negative thing.\"\n\nDrawing from his own experience as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, James understands the weight of enormous expectations. Despite being hailed as the next Michael Jordan straight out of high school, he managed to rise to the occasion and carve out a remarkable career.\n\nWith an impressive track record including 20 All-Star appearances, four NBA championships, and numerous MVP titles, James has proven his ability to thrive under intense scrutiny.\n\nComparably, Caitlin Clark has been thrust into the spotlight after a stellar college career and a standout performance in her early WNBA games. As the first overall pick for the Indiana Fever, she faces significant pressure to deliver results.

They're 0-4 with three of their losses coming by double digits.\n\nClark still continues to amaze, but it may take some time until that manifests into wins - and the ratings could suffer.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/41/841c95ec-ec4f-5312-b4e2-25623276b9a9/664d37fb97b6f.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Jersey sales are up, and TV viewership numbers have skyrocketed across women's basketball. April's draft averaged a record 2.47 million viewers (a 307% increase over last year), and it was the most-viewed WNBA telecast since 2000.\n\n\"People who are in the right position are just taking the baton and moving it forward,\" Charles said.\n\nThe 2012 WNBA MVP credited Clark specifically for helping make it all happen, but she made it clear that players like Cameron Brink and Angel Reese are doing their parts, too.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_harding@outkick.com", "name": "Amber Harding", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/Display-Media-40.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

However, the Fever's heartbreaking loss to the Connecticut Sun on Monday shows that while they've been struggling, they are inching closer to where they need to be.\n\nFormer NBA player Richard Jefferson even compared Indiana's situation to Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs, via ESPN's WNBA Today show.\n\n\"Victor Wembanyama we raved about...He went to the worst team,\" Jefferson said. \"They sucked. It's going to take some time!\"\n\nIs Jefferson making excuses for Clark and Indiana's rough start, or is the comparison warranted?\n\nThere are many parallels between the Fever and Spurs\n\nJefferson's comparison makes sense, as both organizations lucked into drafting generational prospects after being bottom-feeder squads. Wembanyama and Clark are both seen as players who could be on all-time great lists by the time they hang up the sneakers.\n\nThe Spurs still struggled after drafting \"Wemby,\" limping to a 22-60 finish this past year. However, the French international had a historic year, becoming the first rookie in NBA history to make All-Defensive first team. He also was the Rookie of the Year and could be the first rookie to make an All-NBA team since San Antonio legend Tim Duncan 26 years ago. The All-NBA squad will be announced Wednesday.\n\nIt's hard to tell if Clark will reach similar heights this season, in large part because of the ankle injury she suffered on Monday. While the Iowa alum returned after going down with the ailment, it could be a lingering issue as the year wears on.\n\nClark brushed it off postgame, via ESPN's Stephen Holder.\n\n\"Every basketball player's had an ankle injury,\" she said. \"If you [haven't], you're not a true baller, I guess. I don't know. It'll be a little stiff, but I'll be good.\"\n\nFever coach Christie Sides admitted that she was worried, but also admired Clark's resilience.\n\n\"She's tough,\" Sides said. \"She didn't want anybody to help her off the court. I love that about her. I love that's what she's about. She walked it off herself, did what she needed to do to come back in the game.\"\n\nIf this injury turns out to be anything more than a blip on the radar, it'll be hard for Clark to live up to Wembanyama's rookie year. The 20-year-old was lucky enough to not have any major issues, appearing in 71 out of 82 games.\n\nIt's rare for teams with the first overall pick to completely turn it around the following year. While drafting a potential Hall-of-Famer is exciting, it doesn't immediately undo the organizational issues that cause a team to draft that highly in the first place.\n\nThe Spurs, for example, may not be good next season, either. The team won't contend until it gets standout players to support Wembanyama.\n\nWith this in mind, it's important to keep expectations at bay for the Fever this year.

That's just life. We all went through it. You see it on the NBA side, and you're going to see it on this side. You look superhuman playing against some 18-year-olds, but you're going to come play with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.\n\n\"Not saying it's not going to translate, because when you're great at what you do you're just going to get better, but there is going to be a transition period when you have to give some grace as a rookie. It may take a little bit longer for some people.\"\n\nWho would know better what lies ahead for the NCAA Division I all-time scoring leader than the WNBA's all-time scoring leader?\n\n\"The new fans are really sensitive these days,\" Taurasi told The Arizona Republic during the Phoenix Mercury's training camp weeks ago. \"You can't say anything.\n\n\"It's kind of like when you go from kindergarten to first grade, there's a learning adjustment. When you go from high school to college, there's a learning adjustment. I don't think I said anything that wasn't factually correct. Like anything, greatness is going to translate and (Clark has) proven that at every level. I don't see it being any different in the WNBA.\"\n\nAfter a week and four games into Clark's rookie season, Taurasi's blunt warning is proving to be somewhat prophetic.\n\nWhile leading Iowa to a 34-5 record during her record-breaking 2023-24 senior season, the 6-foot scoring sensation averaged 31.6 points, 7.4 rebounds, 8.9 assists while shooting 45.5% from the field and 37.8% on 3-pointers.\n\nHeading into Wednesday's 7 p.m. matchup against the Storm -- her first WNBA game in Seattle -- the Indiana Fever's No. 1 overall draft pick is averaging 17 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists while shooting 41.2% from the floor and 34.3% on 3s.\n\nThose are better than respectable statistics for Clark, who is the favorite to win the WNBA Rookie of the Year award.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arizona_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Arizona Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/290/29031/2903129.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The fans don't want it and I know the coaches don't want to do it!\" one user posted.\n\nAnother griped, \"To me, regardless of sport, these in game interviews are worthless. No coach or player is saying anything earth shattering. It's intrusive and annoying. Brings nothing to the broadcast.\"\n\n\"I absolutely hate this. I hated it with the Aces the other day too,\" a separate user wrote. \"That coach wasn't feeling it.\"\n\nWhat the user was referring to transpired last week, when Aces head coach Becky Hammon's in-game exchange ended with an awkward pause following a question.\n\nHammon, coming off back-to-back WNBA championships with the Aces, later told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that she experienced difficulty hearing broadcasters Tiffany Greene and Debbie Antonelli.\n\n\"I didn't hear the question. I heard the first one and then there was just this man super loud in my ear,\" Hammon said. \"There was no guy on the call.

The Kentucky Derby. Put your blinders on, go to work, show up to work, punch your clock in, prepare yourself, work on your game, work on your craft.\n\n\"Kind of keep your mouth shut and just learn from the vets. When they ask, voice your opinion if they want your opinion early because everybody is looking for you to say anything and they're gonna splice it and cut it and make it a negative thing.\"\n\nWhen James entered the NBA as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, he was being heralded by many as the second coming of Michael Jordan despite the fact that he was coming straight out of high school.\n\nMost would have folded under that pressure, but LeBron was up for the task, and went on to establish himself as one of the all-time greats.\n\nJames is a 20-time All-Star, four-time NBA champion, four-time NBA Finals MVP, four-time NBA MVP and the NBA's all-time leading scorer, plus he continues to play at an elite level at 39 years of age.\n\nThe hype surrounding Clark is similar, although she is essentially being placed in a class of her own rather than being compared to past greats.\n\nClark was a two-time National Player of the Year in college and she led Iowa to the National Championship Game in back-to-back seasons, making her a no-brainer pick at No. 1 overall for the Fever.\n\nThrough her first four WNBA games, all eyes have been on Clark, and she has been solid, averaging 17.0 points, 5.5 assists and 4.0 rebounds per game, but Indiana is 0-4.\n\nThat has inevitably led some observers to question whether Clark is truly as good as advertised, but James pointed out that the Fever have had back-to-back No. 1 overall picks, meaning they have a long way to go as a team.\n\nIt is going to be a process even with an elite talent like Clark in the fold, and James is well aware of that, given that he didn't reach the playoffs until his third NBA season.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors":

After graduating in 2003, he entered the NBA draft and was selected No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThrough his first four professional games -- the same number Clark has played with the Indiana Fever at this point -- James averaged 15.2 points with 8.2 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 3.2 turnovers. Solid numbers for a rookie, but not as mind-blowing as some may have expected or hoped.

The Chicago Sky's Angel Reese and Los Angeles Sparks' Cameron Brink also became household names in a way that's benefiting the league.\n\nBy crediting Clark, Reese, Brink and their first-year peers, you risk overlooking the players who came before them.

The Fever come back at +205 road underdogs to pick up their first W of the season. The over/under is sitting at 164. .\n\nOdds as of May 20. See all of the betting deposit methods available to wager on sports.\n\nThe Fever got a big scare last time out against the Connecticut Sun: leading scorer and Rookie of the Year favorite Caitlin Clark (17.0 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG) rolled her ankle and exited the game in the first half. But the all-time leading NCAA scorer returned in the second half, finishing with a team-high 17 points, and she isn't even listed on the team's injury report ahead of their matchup with Seattle.\n\nSeattle star Nneka Ogwumike, however, is listed as a game-time decision with an ankle injury of her own. Averaging a team-high 22.0 PPG, the 33-year-old Ogwumike has missed the last two games, which included Seattle's first win of the season (84-75 at Washington) and an 11-point loss at New York (74-63) as 14.5-point road underdogs. This is Ogwumike's first season with the Storm after spending the first 12 seasons of her career with Los Angeles.\n\nSeattle's Jewell Loyd has the highest point total of the night at 22.5 O/U. Lody is only averaging 16.8 PPG this season but averaged a career-best 24.7 PPG last year and scored 24 in the win over Washington with Ogwumike out.\n\nClark's total is at just 19.5, the first time this season she's been listed under 20. Averaging 17 points per game so far in his young career, Clark as gone over 19.5 twice in her first four games and hit at least 17 three times.

While there's been a wave of investment across the W, the enormous pay gap remains despite more attention on the league than ever before.\n\nThe first step toward closing the gap will be possibly opting out of the current collective bargaining agreement, which runs through 2027, before the 2025 WNBA season. The Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) has the option to exercise the opt-out this November. This is a pivotal moment for the WNBPA to negotiate league minimum salaries, bonuses and better overall financial benefits for players.\n\nAs of now, WNBA players receive 50% of incremental revenue, a percentage of earnings that exceeds expected revenue targets. Meanwhile NBA players receive 50% of total revenue, which includes basketball-related income like broadcast rights, regular-season ticket sales and merchandise.\n\nThe NBA, which owns about 50% of the WNBA, justifies the disparity between the two leagues because of the audience size and massive revenues that the NBA reels in compared to the W. Just this season the NBA generated a record $1.5 billion in sponsorship revenue alone.\n\nBut this reality hasn't stopped the women's side from fighting for more. The increase in their salaries also hinges on the WNBA striking strong media rights agreements with its current deals with ESPN, CBS and Ion expiring in 2025. Those deals are expected to be more lucrative with the recent star-studded rookie class featuring players such as Clark, Sky's Angel Reese and Sparks' Cameron Brink.\n\nIn the meantime, fans continue to watch and support players like Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson, the New York Liberty's Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu, and Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner, all of whom are among the most popular stars in the WNBA. But they're not among the highest-paid this season.\n\nWilson's teammate, Jackie Young, has the title of the highest-paid player, earning $252,450, according to Spotrac, which tracks player salaries and contract value. Playing for the reigning back-to-back champion Aces, Young is one of the league's best players.\n\nThe two-time WNBA All Star is followed up on the list by Seattle's Jewell Loyd ($245,508), Phoenix's Kahleah Cooper ($245,059), Dallas' Arike Ogunbowale ($241,984) and Phoenix's Diana Taurasi ($234,936).\n\nWilson, Clark, Stewart and Ionescu represent the group of stars who may not have the most valuable contracts this season, but they make up the difference with endorsement deals and sponsorship gigs that other lesser-known players don't receive.\n\nThere are also other avenues for top players to receive additional money. Clark, for example, could earn $250,000 under the league's player marketing agreements (PMAs).\n\nThe PMA program, which was introduced as part of the current CBA inked back in 2020, calls for the W to contribute up to $1 million annually to the program. The premise of the initiative is to help players earn more income and build off-the-court brands while promoting the league itself.\n\nThere are also opportunities for players to cash in through the team marketing agreements (TMAs). They are another leaguewide initiative designed to support players elevating the WNBA's profile. This program features teams spending as much as $100,000 per year (but no less $50,000) on players who achieve various performance goals like winning awards or reaching the All-Star Game as a participant.\n\nThe 2020 CBA was touted as a groundbreaking agreement that provided more financial security for WNBA players. But more than four years later, it's expected that the players' union will push to upgrade compensation packages while leveraging the unprecedented growth across the league.", "source": {"uri": "sportico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportico.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_jackson@sportico.com", "name": "Eric Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Young_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackie Young (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Griner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2152474274-e1715797673530.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587163", "eventUri": "eng-9587163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

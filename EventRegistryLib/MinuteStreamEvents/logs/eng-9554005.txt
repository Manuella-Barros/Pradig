Youngster Dawson will be hoping to continue that trend after an impressive season for the B-team and the 20-year-old midfielder has signed a one-year extension to 2025.\n\nMontgomery is already well-known to fans but has had a difficult season with injury - which curtailed a January loan to Motherwell early. His existing deal was due to run to 2026 but he has signed an extension through to 2027, effectively covering a season that has been derailed by a hamstring problem.\n\nJoey Dawson - new deal to 2025 Adam Montgomery - new deal to 2027\n\nElsewhere, former Hibs keeper Adam Bogdan reckons Celtic are 'more like a Premier League team' than anything else in Scotland. The Hungarian keeper, who previously spent four years at Liverpool and played in the English top flight, had an impressive six months at Easter Road under Neil Lennon before problems with concussion cost him. By the time he'd recovered, Lennon had been sacked, and he had lost his spot.\n\nHe later featured against the Hoops for Ferencvaros in the Europa League and he reckons playing against Celtic is like coming up against a top flight team down south - unlike other clubs in Scotland he's faced. Bogdan told Ladbrokes' Fanzone: \"The Scottish league is funny because it's a little bit like a time-travel, sometimes. You know, some places you'd travel to and the games you'd be involved in... there was lots of playing long, and second balls. But then you play against Celtic, who are more like a Premier League team, and then Rangers, in front of 50,000 people.\n\n\"Then you go away to another game, where the standard feels more like League One, or League Two football. You get everything in Scotland, but I really enjoyed my time up there.\"\n\nIt's derby day this weekend and Celtic hero Paul Lambert doesn't believe Rangers stand a chance. He feels the pressure firmly on the Ibrox side could be the difference, and can't remember the last time he was impressed with them at a Parkhead derby.\n\nLambert told Betway: \"The pressure on Rangers in the Scottish Premiership title race is on Rangers, without a shadow of a doubt. Celtic were in charge, then Rangers and now Celtic again. I can't see Celtic relinquishing it now. Celtic will be in a stronger position and I think everything is going to hinge on the Old Firm game.\n\n\"Rangers have to go to Parkhead and when the Rangers don't get the win, it's over. They haven't got a great record there. There will be some pressure on Celtic because there will be 63,000 on their backs, so it can work for you or it can work against you. Rangers will play without the burden of having to face criticism from their own fans and I'm not sure if Rangers can handle that.\n\n\"I can't remember a game in which Rangers deserved to beat Celtic at Parkhead. I think Celtic at this moment in time are definitely in a stronger position.\"\n\nLambo also had a nibble at the idea of the Hoops, and Rangers, playing in the Premier League one day as he added: \"If you gave Celtic and Rangers a couple of years in the Premier League with those finances, they would be up there without a shadow of a doubt. But some players can't handle the pressure of it because it's a massive, massive, massive pressure at two great clubs.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robbie_copeland@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Robbie Copeland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joey Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Vata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Vata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Tierney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Tierney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ralston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Ralston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dawson_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dawson (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1d\u00e1m_Bogd\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1d\u00e1m Bogd\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherwell_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motherwell F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lambert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Lambert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferencv\u00e1rosi_TC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hibernian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_Two", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL League Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL League One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Premiership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Premiership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrox_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibrox Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Firm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32767476.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Celtic-FC-Media-Access.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554005", "eventUri": "eng-9554005", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Can they see it out?", "body": "No manager in Old Firm history has enjoyed the success-rate in these encounters that Brendan Rodgers has. And it's little wonder the Northern Irishman expects to relish the occasion tomorrow given his record of 12 wins, three draws and just a single defeat in the derbies across his two terms in charge of Celtic to date.\n\nThe Celtic players celebrate Adam Idah's late goal at Ibrox with manager Brendan Rodgers (Image: SNS)\n\nREAD MORE: Celtic captain McGregor throws down gauntlet to Rangers\n\nWith a full squad to pick from, on the back of a spirited and convincing 3-0 win over third force Hearts at Celtic Park last weekend, and having gone unbeaten in the three derbies to date during the current campaign despite two of those being contested at Ibrox, it is hard to envisage how Philippe Clement's side punctures that bubble, especially given Rangers' recent travails on the road which have allowed Celtic to pull three points clear at this critical stage of the campaign.\n\nTomorrow's encounter arrives with the kind of fanfare inspired by Robin Williams' Genie to signal the entrance of Prince Ali to Agrabah hoping to woo the Sultan's daughter, Jasmine. The prize on offer in this instance, meanwhile, is the glittering Premiership trophy currently residing in the Celtic Park trophy room, and for the rug to be pulled from under Rodgers' feet now it would have to be some kind of magic carpet.\n\nWhile all eyes will be on Celtic Park tomorrow afternoon, it was the first derby of the season at Ibrox back in September, when Michael Beale was still at the helm of the Ibrox club, that could prove to have the greatest sway on the destination of the silverware this month. In a match that almost flew in under the radar, Celtic prevailed that day thanks to a Kyogo Furuhashi strike on the stroke of half-time and by the time Beale had been relieved of his duties at the start of October and was replaced by Clement, many had already written the season off for the Ibrox club.\n\nCommendably, Clement clawed back that deficit as Celtic faltered, but it was again in the derby at the turn of the year that Rodgers' side showed there remains a gulf in quality between the two sides, even if Celtic are capable of a wobble every now and again.\n\nKyogo Furuhashi celebrates his goal against Rangers on December 30 (Image: SNS)\n\nREAD MORE: Scottish football set for another Helicopter Sunday according to Burke\n\nIn the return meeting at Parkhead, Celtic surged into a 2-0 lead just two minutes into the second half, their rivals appeared to capitulate by going down to 10 men when Leon Balogun was ordered off for a last-man wipeout of Daizen Maeda with just under 20 minutes to go, before James Tavernier salvaged some pride with a late, and wonderfully taken, free-kick strike to post a 2-1 scoreline. It ended up closer than it should have been for Rodgers and Celtic. One diamond in the rough for Rangers this season may be that if any phrase could sum up Rodgers' first season back in Glasgow, that is probably it.\n\nCeltic are currently sitting pretty on 84 points, three ahead of Rangers in second, and with a superior goal difference which provides a further buffer to their lead with just three games to play. Victory against their rivals tomorrow would give them a six-point and minimum six-goal advantage with just six points left to play for. But they should be further out in front at this stage. Perhaps that is cause for some embers of optimism to burn on among the Rangers support.\n\nDespite any peaks and troughs in form, changes of manager across the city or injury crises this season, however, Celtic have been on course for three in a row ever since they won that first Old Firm of the season at Ibrox back in September.\n\nTomorrow's encounter in Parkhead, mercifully the final edition of the away-fan shutout period, could allow the SPFL to take back the deposit on their helicopter hire for the final weekend should the Scottish champions prevail.\n\nRangers forward Rabbi Matondo celebrates his last-gasp equaliser against Celtic at Ibrox (Image: SNS)\n\nREAD MORE: Celtic winger set to have 'huge influence' in Scottish title race\n\nHome advantage aside, Celtic's dominance in the fixture this season is stark. In the most recent encounter at Ibrox, last season's treble-winners came flying out the blocks and soared into a 2-0 first-half lead, only for Tavernier again to give Rangers a route back, this time from the penalty spot. With the bulk of the second period to go on this occasion, Abdallah Sima was able to find an unlikely leveller with just four minutes remaining, before Celtic substitute Adam Idah appeared to have won it again for the visitors.\n\nBut, again, Rodgers' side let their rivals off the hook and Rabbi Matondo struck in injury time to prevent Rodgers making it a clean sweep in the derbies since his return to Parkhead last summer. But make no mistake, that derby was a must-win encounter for Rangers at home to their rivals and they were never really in a position to clinch all three points.\n\nSo, while Clement led his players on a victory lap of Ibrox at full-time, the result in reality bolstered Rodgers' already haughty record in the fixture with the 3-3 draw in Govan. This dominance will most likely ensure the Premiership trophy remains in Parkhead this summer.\n\nPhilippe Clement celebrates his side's 3-3 draw with Celtic at Ibrox last month (Image: SNS)\n\nREAD MORE: Rangers boss Clement makes four-man SFWA manager of the year shortlist\n\nWhichever team performs best in the derbies will almost always lift the silverware at the end of the season. It's hardly rocket science. Even if both sides win every match against all the other teams, there are 12 points to play for in the derbies and that offers a gaping chasm in terms of the final standings. Celtic's seven points collected out of a possible nine so far this season is the reason they currently occupy pole position, and that hot streak of form gives them the clear edge for this one.\n\nWith the Met Office signalling that it will be hotter in Glasgow tomorrow than it will be in Ibiza, Rodgers will be looking to have his fun in the sun as the supporters arrive expecting to get the three-in-a-row party started early at Celtic Park.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The aftermath of Celtic's win over Rangers in September was a case in point.\n\nThe return of Brendan Rodgers to Celtic wasn't met with universal acclaim. Memories of the Northern Irishman performing a midnight flit to join Leicester City in February 2019 raised issues of trust among supporters tired of being let down by managers who expressed their love for the club one week, then packed a suitcase the next.\n\nAfter all that syrup on the pitch about the late Tommy Burns, Ange Postecoglou fled for Spurs as fast as his legs could take him. If an English club came back in for Rodgers, there was an obvious suspicion. He'd be next.\n\nIn a bid to quell his doubters, the Parkhead boss stood with a scarf over his head on the day of his unveiling and uttered five words: 'I'll see you in May.'\n\nCeltic have never been wholly convincing this season. The travails of a hard campaign have raised significant moments of doubt over the team and the manager's decision to return to Glasgow. His body language has been studied more closely than his tactics.\n\nDespite the loss of Aaron Mooy, Jota, Carl Starfelt and Liel Abada, the poor summer recruitment, the squabbles between the board of directors and the Green Brigade and injuries to key players like Callum McGregor, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Daizen Maeda and Reo Hatate, however, one thing has always offered Rodgers a level of insurance a Celtic manager can't buy. His record against Rangers.\n\nRodgers has had the measure of Rangers throughout his two spells as manager of Celtic\n\nClement and Rodgers embrace at the end of the pulsating 3-3 draw the last time the sides met\n\nAfter the Ibrox win which sealed Michael Beale's fate in September, a picture appeared on social media of the Northern Irishman in his car, window down, shades protecting his eyes like a Top Gun extra, arm raised as he milked the acclaim of supporters on London Road. The boss was back.\n\nUndefeated in the two derbies since, December 2018 remains the only time Rodgers has lost a game to Celtic's bitter rivals.\n\nSteven Gerrard was still in the opposite technical area. Of the 22 players who started the game, only McGregor, James Forrest and James Tavernier are likely to feature at Parkhead tomorrow. McGregor was pushed in as a makeshift left-back and Rangers deserved to win by more than one goal.\n\nThe exception rather than the rule, Rodgers has now taken charge of Celtic in 16 Glasgow derbies and lost just one. During that run he has won games 4-0, 5-0 and 5-1 and, while Rangers are a good deal more competitive than they were in his first spell in charge, Celtic have still scored 37 goals and conceded 11.\n\nIn 1,440 minutes, they've been trailing for just 108, racking up eight clean sheets to Rangers' two. But for a goal of the season contender from Rabbi Matondo in a 3-3 draw last month, they'd have one hand on the league trophy already.\n\nRodgers was pictured enjoying the moment in the aftermath of the season's first derby\n\nClement knows his Rangers side realistically have to win at Celtic Park to stay in the title hunt\n\nThe cyclical nature of football flips these things around eventually. Martin O'Neill enjoyed seven straight wins over Rangers before Alex McLeish stopped the rot. Given the chance to bring in his own players and clear out the old guard from Rangers, Philippe Clement has done enough to suggest he'll be a formidable opponent.\n\nSpeaking after the win at Parkhead in December, however, Rodgers pointed to the five Rangers managers he'd seen off the premises already. Unless the Belgian finds a way to start winning against Celtic quickly, he runs the risk of becoming victim No 6.\n\nWhen Rodgers promised to 'have some fun' this weekend, Clement was touchy in his response. An old hand at the mind games, Celtic's manager relentlessly preaches the need for calm. Taking the bait isn't an option.\n\nWhile 60,000 home fans and no away supporters should be an advantage, it could easily prove a hindrance if Rangers score first and agitation creeps in to the stands.\n\nHearts started strongly at Parkhead last weekend but failed to take their chances, paying the price when Kyogo Furuhashi scored twice and Matt O'Riley added a late penalty.\n\nMark Warburton and Joey Barton suffer at the hands of Celtic and Rodgers in 2016\n\nGraeme Murty's derby day experiences up against Rodgers were excruciating to watch\n\nRodgers has already warned Rangers to expect the 'best version' of Celtic seen since his return last summer. When his side were dropping points to Motherwell, St Johnstone, Hearts (twice), Aberdeen and Hibs, the 'see you in May' statement ran the risk of coming back to bite him on the backside.\n\nAgainst Hearts last weekend, however, there were signs of the power and the control coming back at just the right time. Supporters revelled in the kind of high tempo, aggressive performance largely missing for much of the season.\n\nCeltic looked like a side timing their run. With Hatate, Carter-Vickers and Maeda back fit and firing, fans will turn up tomorrow lunchtime expecting blood in the water.\n\nWhile a point would be no disaster for either side, another Celtic victory would leave the home team with a six point advantage with two games to play. The Brendan Rodgers hex over Rangers would continue.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was his ability to dig out big results, often against the odds, that made them possible.\n\nTrips across town in the 1990s were often preceded by the Rangers manager giving an injury update that sounded more like a roll call after a military advance.\n\nWalter Smith celebrates title success in 2011, having once again had the measure of Celtic\n\nThe Rangers manager celebrates another victory over his great Glasgow rivals\n\nA strange paradox often played out. When Smith could call upon a full quota of players, visits to Celtic Park frequently ended in defeat. When his side was badly hampered by injuries and suspensions, an away win was invariably the outcome.\n\n'Put it on my tombstone -- Andy Goram broke my heart,' Tommy Burns famously said after an extraordinary rearguard action by the keeper helped Smith's side to a crucial 0-0 draw at Celtic Park en route to the title in 1996.\n\nThis ability to avoid defeat in the toughest game on the Scottish card was a cornerstone of the success Smith (right) and his players lapped up in those times.\n\nIn the storied nine-in-a-row era between 1988/89 and 1996/97, they registered at least one away league victory in Old Firm games per season (including the 1994-95 season when Celtic played at Hampden).\n\nWhile the points gained through those derbies were no more than those on offer against other top-flight rivals, Smith, who took charge towards the end of 1990-91, knew the psychological importance of winning at Parkhead -- both for his side and for Celtic.\n\nJust as Rangers' ability to regularly record triumphs in the east end of Glasgow was intrinsically linked to that long cycle of titles, a wretched run in recent years at Celtic Park has gone hand-in-hand with a barren era.\n\nPhilippe Clement is searching for an Old Firm victory that help pave the way to title success\n\nClement and Rodgers embrace after the last Old Firm derby, but who will be smiling this time?\n\nWhen Philippe Clement's side were defeated 2-1 on December 30, they chalked up their fourth straight loss on Kerrydale Street.\n\nTheir last victory there, a 2-0 win, came in the Covid season of 2020-21 when there were no fans present.\n\nThe previous year, as Steven Gerrard and his charges celebrated a 2-1 victory at Parkhead in front of a pocket of visiting fans, the expectation was that they would go on and win the title. This was not how it played out.\n\nSmith was actually the last Rangers manager to win at Celtic Park -- under normal circumstances -- and then close out a championship.\n\nThat was at the outset of 2010-11 when his team won 3-1 in the first derby of the season. In 17 subsequent games there, Rangers have won two, drawn four and lost 11.\n\nWhat was once a happy hunting ground has lately become a place of great pain. Mark Warburton lost 5-1 there. Graeme Murty was hammered 5-0. Neither man lived to tell the tale.\n\nCeltic's record in away games in the corresponding period is a different story altogether with eight wins and three draws. There has been no bigger factor in their own era of dominance than their ownership of this famous fixture -- wherever it's been staged.\n\nFor Clement to stand a chance of preventing Celtic from winning a 12th title in 13 years, a defeat tomorrow is simply unthinkable.\n\nSteven Gerrard is the last Rangers boss to win at Parkhead, a 2-1 success in December 2019\n\nMark Warburton and his Rangers side well ill-equipped to take on all-conquering Rodgers\n\nGraeme Murty's short reign as Rangers manager brought with it 4-0 and 5-0 defeats\n\nBrendan Rodgers and his players wouldn't yet be popping the champagne corks if they win. But a six-point gap and a superior goal difference with two games remaining would all but settle the issue.\n\nA share of the spoils would keep Rangers afloat. Stick a few goals past Dundee on Tuesday and Celtic would travel to Rugby Park the following night with little room for error.\n\nAt the very least, the trophy engraver would be kept waiting for a few days yet. The helicopter would be put on standby.\n\nThe consensus, though, is that no less than a win will do for Clement's side. While they'd still have to hold their nerve in the final two matches -- perhaps having to prevail on goal difference -- they would be imbued with a fresh sense of belief and purpose as they seek to get their noses over the line first.\n\nA tall order becomes that little bit tougher with the knowledge that there will be no visiting fans present.\n\nThis scenario clearly worked against Rangers at Ibrox in September, but a lack of faith in Michael Beale at that point contributed to a mutinous atmosphere after Celtic scored the only goal of the game.\n\nGiven what's on the line tomorrow, Clement's side will have to go some way to flip that situation in their favour. With a win all but wrapping up the title, the target of the hostility for the home fans is unlikely to change across 90 minutes, no matter how the game maps out.\n\nTensions were high the last time the two sides did battle, with the spoils shared in a 3-3 draw\n\nRodgers has an exemplary derby record, losing just one of his 16 Old Firm battles to date\n\nIf only the absence of Rangers supporters was Clement's sole concern. Connor Goldson is now out injured for the season -- with Oscar Cortes and Danilo in the same boat.\n\nWhile Clement is hopeful that Abdallah Sima and Rabbi Matondo can feature at some stage before the curtain comes down, Saturday may come too soon. There are also no assurances over Ryan Jack's comeback date.\n\nRodgers, meanwhile, is preparing to disappoint players. After an injury-interrupted season, the Celtic manager believes the watching world will see the 'best version' of his side come Saturday. If he's proven to be correct, a Rangers team with psychological scarring from recent visits to this venue could be in for a long afternoon.\n\nThis, though, is precisely what Clement signed up for in October. While he is due some credit for reducing the deficit to the league leaders from seven points to three under his watch, he wasn't employed to close gaps. He's there to overturn them.\n\nAnd given Beale was shown the door after just seven league games, the Belgian has certainly had sufficient time to do just that.\n\nWith key visiting players missing and a partisan home crowd hoping to see their team close out the title, the odds are certainly stacked against Rangers. Once upon a time, however, that's exactly how they liked it.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

vs. Rangers - prediction, team news, lineups", "body": "Sports Mole previews Saturday's Scottish Premiership clash between Celtic and Rangers, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nAiming to take a significant step towards a third straight Scottish Premiership crown, Celtic will welcome arch rivals Rangers to Celtic Park for an Old Firm derby clash on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Bhoys are in pole position to retain the Scottish crown for another season, whilst the Gers will feel this weekend is the final realistic opportunity to close the gap their Glasgow neighbours.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nSince the post-season split in the middle of April, title holders Celtic have recorded back-to-back wins in the Championship Group in order to boost their chances of recording a third successive Premiership crown and the first following the return of Brendan Rodgers as manager last summer.\n\nAlthough Hearts are set to be crowned as the best of the rest in Scotland's top flight, they were simply no match for the Bhoys last Saturday, when Kyogo Furuhashi brace and a second-half brace from goalscoring midfielder Matt O'Riley secured a 3-0 success for the hosts at Parkhead.\n\nHeading into the final three matches of the Premiership term, Celtic are currently sitting pretty in first place, three points ahead of second-placed Rangers, with matches against the Gers, Kilmarnock and St Mirren to come before an Old Firm Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park on May 25.\n\nSince the beginning of March, the Bhoys' record at Celtic Park has been worthy of the Premiership title, with Saturday's hosts winning all three league matches at their Glasgow base by an aggregate score of 9-1, leaving St Johnstone, St Mirren and Hearts all in their wake.\n\nWith Celtic aiming to secure the services of Norwich City loanee Adam Idah on a permanent deal in the summer, there is an emphasis on the Hoops improving their striking ranks following a 2023-24 term in which midfielder O'Riley currently leads the Golden Boot race with 14 Premiership goals.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nFollowing a damaging three-game winless run prior to the post-season split - collecting just two points during that period - Rangers have managed to get their title challenge back on track over the past fortnight, winning 2-1 at St Mirren before thrashing Kilmarnock 4-1 seven days later.\n\nThe Gers looked on course for a fatal defeat in terms of their Premiership dreams when Killie raced into the lead at Ibrox courtesy of a James Tavernier own goal, however strikes from Fabio Silva, Ben Davies, Tom Lawrence and John Souttar ensured a relatively comfortable afternoon in the end for the hosts.\n\nWith Celtic, surprise package Dundee and Hearts left to come in this top-flight campaign, Phillipe Clement's side know that defeat at Parkhead on Saturday would see them fall to six points behind the Bhoys with only two fixtures remaining, effectively ending Rangers' title ambitions.\n\nDespite Rodgers's side having major injury issues throughout the season, Rangers have been unbeaten to best Celtic on any of the three occasions the two sides have clashed so far this term, with Saturday's visitors failing to win at Celtic Park during their last four attempts.\n\nCeltic Scottish Premiership form: W W D W W W\n\nCeltic form (all competitions): W D W W W W\n\nRangers Scottish Premiership form: W D L D W W\n\nRangers form (all competitions): D L D W W W\n\nTeam News\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCeltic almost have a clean bill of health ahead of the penultimate Old Firm derby of the campaign, with only James McCarthy (hamstring) taking up a spot in the medical room.\n\nImpressing massively since returning from an Achilles injury, Callum McGregor will start alongside leading marksman O'Riley and Reo Hatate in the engine room.\n\nThere is a serious brewing based on who should play on the flanks for the Bhoys in this one, with Nicolas-Gerrit Kuhn fighting James Forrest for a spot alongside Daizen Maeda and Furuhashi in the hosts' forward line.\n\nAfter netting a dramatic 86th-minute equaliser off the bench versus Celtic in the reverse fixture last month, Abdallah Sima will be unable to repeat the trick on Saturday due to a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Gers are also light of options in their backline, with centre-back Connor Goldson sidelined for the remainder of the campaign due to a knee issue.\n\nFollowing his replacement at half time during the win over Kilmarnock, Leon Balogun could drop out of the XI to make room for former Sheffield United man Ben Davies.\n\nCeltic possible starting lineup:\n\nHart; Johnston, Carter-Vickers, Scales, Taylor; O'Riley, McGregor, Hatate; Maeda, Kuhn, Furuhashi\n\nRangers possible starting lineup:\n\nButland; Tavernier, Davies, Souttar, Barisic; Diomande, Lundstram, Sterling, Lawrence, Silva; Dessers\n\nWe say: Celtic 2-1 Rangers\n\nWith essentially a full first-team squad to select from for the first time in the Old Firm derby this season, Celtic should be confident of taking a massive leap towards retaining their Premiership crown.\n\nThe onus is on Rangers to beat their arch rivals at Parkhead to keep their title dreams alive, however we feel that the Gers will fall short this weekend.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match

Sutton is convinced being nerveless is priceless as Brendan Rodgers' team aim to deliver a fatal blow to the title hopes of their rivals. The Record Sport columnist says Philippe Clement's side simply have to win and explained: \"It's huge, it's immense and, as much as ability, it is going to come down to who can handle it. How you react and how you perform under such severe scrutiny is what separates in this match. I've seen players excel, I've seen others fold. It's not easy, it's not for everyone, but if you can't cope, you will go under.\"\n\nSutton feels Celtic's added experience will help in that regard, but could be offset by a nothing-to-lose outlook from Rangers. He said: \"Brendan Rodgers' team have had the best of it in the Old Firm games this season and, when it comes to winning titles and winning these games overall, they have far more in the ranks.\n\n\"In that respect, Celtic look strong. But the equation is simple for Rangers. They need to win. A draw is no good. With that in mind, it could work in their favour. Remove any shackles. We know how Rangers are going to play, they will be direct, they will try to get at Celtic and test them.\"\n\nClement responded strongly to a comment from Rodgers last weekend about having fun, but Sutton isn't reading into so-called mind games. He said: \"Brendan might have gotten under big Phil's skin a bit, but, really and truly, it's irrelevant. I've never seen a comment win a game.\"\n\nSutton takes a similar view when it comes to the attendance at Celtic Park, which will be made up exclusively of 60,000 home fans. He said: \"Listen, I know what it is like to have a huge crowd behind you in this game. It can be inspiring, it can take you to another level.\n\n\"But, at the same time, it can work both ways. If Rangers get their noses ahead, it can flip. The home fans could get anxious, nervous, agitated and make it harder for their own team.\n\n\"We saw that in the first meeting of the season at Ibrox when Celtic went 1-0 up.

The Daily Mail reported on Thursday that Cooper, currently based in South America where he is known for his ability to spot gems, is set to play a key part in that rebuild and has agreed to take on a senior scouting role.\n\nIt's yet to be announced formally but speaking on a Celtic fan podcast all the way back in 2019, he offered his thoughts on how to get the Hoops up to the same level as Benfica, who have sold the likes of Darwin Nunez and Joao Felix for eye-watering fees to Europe's best clubs. Celtic have pulled their weight on that front, with Kieran Tierney and Jota hitting the \u00a325m barrier, but Cooper had his thoughts on how to take them up a level.\n\nHe told the Celtic Underground podcast: \"Similar clubs around Europe, with a similar revenue - Celtic' revenue (in 2019) was \u00a3103 million, which is higher than Porto, Anderlecht, Ajax, and Sporting. Of all of these clubs, the ones that are successful are the ones that manage to have a transfer balance where they are making 100 per cent profit.\n\n\"The only way clubs like Ajax, Celtic, Anderlecht can do it, is by having about 100 per cent transfer profit and year on year, almost like compound interest, when you're reinvesting in ever-increasing circles and selling again at a higher level, reinvesting at a higher level, selling at a higher level.\n\n\"Benfica who have been doing this have got more than \u00a3350 million in the last ten years worth of profit. Porto are just under that with \u00a3340 million. Salzburg has only been doing this recently. The amounts that they're spending haven't got to that stage yet, but their transfer profit is 170 per cent. That's in a small league that no one wants to go to, not spending that much money. That's just using markets that will give them profits.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robbie_copeland@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Robbie Copeland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Tierney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Tierney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.S.C._Anderlecht", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "R.S.C.

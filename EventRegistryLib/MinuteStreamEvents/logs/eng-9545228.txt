After a campus occupation by students in Columbia University was foiled by the police with prior authorisation from the university president on April 18 -- just a day after it began -- the protests spread throughout the east coast and the rest of the United States.\n\nFor most people, these scenes are unprecedented, as campus unrest, police crackdowns, and the arrest of hundreds of students and faculty members are not usually associated with a developed nation like the US.\n\nAmerican campuses -- home to some of the best and most prestigious universities in the world where numerous world leaders in politics and academia have spent their early years -- have a potent history of student movements that lead to drastic change. From the civil rights movement to the Vietnam war protests or protests against apartheid in South Africa, American universities have risen up during key moments in history against their very own government and social establishments.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1960s in America, the civil rights movement was a series of key social movements that sought to end racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination. Some of the watershed moments within the movement involved black students, who challenged the legal frameworks of segregation that led to important conversations across the US, eventually culminating into lasting change.\n\nFor example, the Greensboro sit-ins were a series of protests held in 1960 in Greensboro, North Carolina, through which four students of the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University -- Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr, and David Richmond -- decided to stand against segregation.\n\nThey decided to go to a retail store called Woolworth, whose service was racially segregated, and attempt to buy lunch there. When they were denied service, the four students simply refused to leave their seats until the store closed. The next day, more students joined, and soon, the protest spread. While many students were arrested because of these peaceful protests, this led to the Woolsworth store and many other establishments repealing their segregationist policies.\n\nFrom this network of sit-in protests emerged the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who coordinated student protests against segregation across the USA. They organised the Freedom Rides, a form of nonviolent protest against the Southern states' practice of segregating interstate travel, and played a major role in organising the March on Washington, a protest action that became famous because of Martin Luther King Jr's \"I have a dream\" speech.\n\nThe SNCC was also instrumental in registering black voters in the deep south and enabling them to practise their democratic rights. However, the organisation later split over political disagreements and eventually dissolved.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement ended in 1968 with the passing of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe Vietnam war, as it dragged along in the late 1960s, had become highly unpopular in the US. Protests started popping up across the country, and university campuses became a hotbed as young, politically aware people who did not wish to be drafted or were pacifists became vocal against the war.\n\nEven then, Columbia University took up a central role in the movement. Unlike 2024, students occupied university buildings instead of establishing encampments. Yet, the response then was the same as now. Police forcibly removed protesters who wanted the US to pull out of a war that was taking place thousands of kilometres away from its shores, and killing thousands of American soldiers and Vietnamese civilians.\n\nThe student protests hit a crescendo in Kent State University in Ohio, in May, 1970. Students were protesting the war in Vietnam and the invasion of Cambodia, and two days after it started, the National Guard was called upon them. On May 4, the National Guard opened fire on protesters and killed four people -- Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer, and William Knox Schroeder.\n\nIn the aftermath, large-scale student strikes and protests took place, even in front of the White House, and the anti-war cause became a central issue in US politics at the time.\n\nThe war in Vietnam eventually ended in 1975.\n\nThe apartheid regime in South Africa -- a government with racist ideologies and segregation as its foundation -- had become something of an embarrassment for the rest of the Western world by the 1980s, but not a lot of pressure was being exerted globally in order to enact significant change.\n\nStudents across America took matters into their own hands, and once again, led by Columbia University, started to press for change.\n\nThe demand at that time was similar to what is being demanded by students now. Students wanted universities to divest from South Africa, cut direct business and economic ties and pull out of deals with companies that benefited from the apartheid regime in that country. Columbia was the first to listen to its students, and soon, 155 universities joined them in this action.\n\nIn 1986, even the US government felt it was time to take action, and passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, whose aim was to pursue no new cooperation with the South African government unless apartheid was repealed.\n\nApartheid eventually ended in South Africa in the early 1990s.\n\nWhile student protests in the US are not as common as they might be in a place like Bangladesh, they are not new. American students have stood up against some of the worst wrongdoings of their own government and its allies in the past, which is why the protests against Israel's war in Gaza is such an important moment in the history of this conflict. It remains to be seen if the government takes these protests seriously, but it is clear that even the citizens of the US, Israel's greatest ally, are starting to see the injustice and lack of humanity in what's going on in Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro sit-ins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disfranchisement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_A&T_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina A&T State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Richmond_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Richmond (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F.

Students wanted universities to divest from South Africa, cut direct business and economic ties and pull out of deals with companies that benefited from the apartheid regime in that country. Columbia was the first to listen to its students, and soon, 155 universities joined them in this action.\n\nIn 1986, even the US government felt it was time to take action, and passed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, whose aim was to pursue no new cooperation with the South African government unless apartheid was repealed.\n\nApartheid eventually ended in South Africa in the early 1990s.\n\nWhile student protests in the US are not as common as they might be in a place like Bangladesh, they are not new. American students have stood up against some of the worst wrongdoings of their own government and its allies in the past, which is why the protests against Israel's war in Gaza is such an important moment in the history of this conflict. It remains to be seen if the government takes these protests seriously, but it is clear that even the citizens of the US, Israel's greatest ally, are starting to see the injustice and lack of humanity in what's going on in Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disfranchisement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_A&T_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina A&T State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Richmond_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Richmond (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "F.

Whittington, a professor of politics at Princeton University, said that universities are meant to be places to explore controversial topics, acting as pillars of free speech.\n\n\"We've given a lot more protection to students to be able to engage in free speech than we might have found a hundred years ago,\" said Whittington. \"Not only doing the heavy lifting of scholarly research and teaching, but also being places where people can debate and engage about how they may personally feel about controversial political and social issues of the day.\"\n\nAs demonstrators protest Israel's war in Gaza and the death toll mounts in the region, protesters are calling for their universities to take action and divest from companies or groups that contribute to Israel's military operations.\n\nHere's a look at the past moments that are reflected in today's protests:\n\nIn the 1960s, college students led sit-ins guided by the pillars of civil disobedience and nonviolent direct action to protest segregation.\n\nIntegrated groups of Black and white student protesters would take over segregated lunch counters, prompting backlash from counterdemonstrators who would harass and assault protesters.\n\nThese protests spread to more than 50 cities nationwide, involving tens of thousands of students and leading to hundreds of arrests for their support of the Civil Rights Movement, according to the Civil Rights and Labor History Consortium at University of Washington.\n\nThis movement led to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a student-led civil rights movement with chapters in states across the South that participated in marches, Freedom Rides, and more acts of protest.\n\nSNCC was not dissimilar from the growing leaders of today's anti-war movements, including Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nIn April 1968, anti-racist protesters and anti-war protesters took over Columbia's Hamilton Hall, as well as several other buildings.\n\nThese protests were in part to protest the university's construction of an athletic complex that \"effectively stole the land from the predominantly Black community that had traditionally used Morningside Park,\" according to Columbia University Libraries.\n\nSome students were also protesting against military recruitment on campus.\n\nThe occupation of Hamilton Hall led to one of the largest mass arrests in New York City history. Police made more than 700 arrests, according to Columbia University.\n\nAccording to the Bill of Rights Institute, a civics nonprofit education center, colleges became the center of the anti-war effort in part because many colleges funded military-related research or allowed corporations with military contracts to recruit new employees on campus.\n\nEnding military recruitment and cutting ties with controversial companies -- including Dow Chemical, which manufactured napalm, an incendiary weapon used in Vietnam -- were key concerns for student protesters.\n\nStudents for a Democratic Society became a national organization with tens of thousands of college student members around the country leading demonstrations.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon promised to bring an end to the war in his campaign for the presidency. So when he announced that the war would be ongoing amid a 1970 U.S. invasion of Cambodia, protests erupted, according to Kent State University archives.\n\nThe Ohio National Guard was sent in to quell intensifying anti-war protests and anti-Nixon sentiment at the Kent State campus on May 1, 1970. The Ohio National Guard members fired into a crowd, killing four people and wounding nine students, according to Kent State.\n\nThe tragedy triggered a national student strike, forcing hundreds of colleges and universities to close.\n\nBorn out of the protest strategies from the anti-Vietnam War and Civil Rights Movements, campus demonstrations in the 1970s and 1980s were launched nationwide against university investments in corporations tied to apartheid, the official racial segregation system in South Africa.\n\nAcross the country, students built encampments on campus to call for their universities to rescind investments, programs and assets that contribute to or benefit from apartheid.\n\nSome built \"shantytowns,\" according to a Daily Tar Heel student report in the 1980s, to highlight the living conditions of Black South Africans under apartheid.\n\nDozens of universities answered the call, divesting in such corporations after years of demonstrations.\n\nMORE: Campus protesters are demanding universities divest from Israel. Here's what that means.\n\nThe movement was one of the most successful divestment campaigns, with renowned South African anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu saying in 2002 that \"there is no greater testament to the basic dignity of ordinary people everywhere than the divestment movement of the 1980s.\"\n\nThese moments in history are reflective in more modern advocacy work,

highlight the living conditions of Black South Africans under apartheid.\n\nDozens of universities answered the call, divesting in such corporations after years of demonstrations.\n\nThe movement was one of the most successful divestment campaigns, with renowned South African anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu saying in 2002 that \"there is no greater testament to the basic dignity of ordinary people everywhere than the divestment movement of the 1980s.\"\n\nThese moments in history are reflective in more modern advocacy work, including the Black Lives Matter movement, the Occupy Wall Street movement, and now the pro-Palestinian divestment movement.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The reaction of university administrations and security forces have also opened a Pandora's box of questions about US claims of democracy.\n\nA wave of pro-Palestinian US campus protests against the Israeli war on Gaza seems to have been contagious, engaging both students and faculty members in a stand-up against police in riot gear and conjuring up images of US student protests against the Vietnam War 56 years ago.\n\nLast week saw massive arrests of students, and some faculty members who joined forces with peaceful junior protesters in support of freedom of expression as the academic year draws to a close and as students are preparing to sit for final exams.\n\nUniversity students in the United States are demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as a university boycott of investments in companies that support arming Israel on the grounds that the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip has in seven months killed more than 35,000 Palestinians while injuring and displacing thousands more.\n\nThe protests have led to the arrest of more than 1,000 demonstrators over the past two weeks ago. The wave of anger reached a peak late on Tuesday 30 April when New York police in riot gear stormed the Columbia University campus to disperse pro-Palestinian demonstrators, dismantled encampments set up by the demonstrators and arrested protesting students. Police arrived in response to a call from Columbia University President Minouche Shafik but the call for help was soon a catalyst for even more protests nationwide.\n\nIn the middle of all the chaos, however, there was one single victory giving protesters a ray of hope. On 30 April Brown University announced that it had reached an agreement with a group of protesting students. The agreement was that the students would remove their tents and, in return, the university would stop investing in companies linked to Israel.\n\nThere has been almost a consensus among students and politicians who spoke to Al-Ahram Weekly that the pro-Palestinian protests may prove fruitful in the long term, increasing awareness of the Palestine issue and putting more pressure on the American government to change its policy towards Israel. That said, many were worried that recent escalations by the police and university administrations to suppress demonstrations and the right to free speech would grow even more violent, and which might even claim the lives of students as was the case in past incidents.\n\nTHE FIRST SPARK: US nationwide student protests against the Israeli genocide in Gaza began at Columbia University in New York on 17 April. Columbia University and its affiliated Barnard College suspended dozens of students participating in the protests. More than 100 demonstrators were arrested in Columbia on 18 April after university President Shafik had summoned New York police to clear an encampment set up by the protesting students on campus. Shafik had testified before a US House of Representatives committee that the encampment was put up in violation of campus regulations and that the protests were unauthorised.\n\nThe escalation on the part of Shafik soon backfired, resulting in yet another sit-in at Columbia University, and ironically, a spillover of protests across dozens of other universities including Yale and Harvard in New York and in Texas and California.\n\n\"Police arrested pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses across the country overnight, notably at the University of California, Los Angeles, where chaotic scenes played out early Thursday as officers in riot gear surged against a crowd of demonstrators,\" according to the AP.\n\nSocial media was soon inundated with footage of heavily armed anti-riot police removing barricades and dismantling the encampments of peaceful demonstrators who defied police orders to leave. Images of students and faculty members forming human shields and chains in defiance of police, which fired flash-bangs to disperse the crowds, went viral across the globe.\n\nColumbia University student Emmett, not his real name, told the Weekly that the escalation by the university's administration \"was totally unjustified\". After all, Emmet explained, the sit-in was a peaceful protest demanding a permanent ceasefire in Gaza as well as an end to US military aid to Israel.\n\nThe protesters also called upon universities to halt all direct and indirect investments with Israel, as well as arms suppliers and all war beneficiaries, and an amnesty for all the students and faculty members who were disciplined, arrested or expelled from university.\n\n\"Those legitimate demands, however, were met with violence by the police and most university administrations,\" New York University student Lucas told the Weekly. Lucas lamented that \"students have not seen this degree of repression since the 1960s when students came out to denounce the war in Vietnam.\"\n\n\"The New York University administration has dismissed dozens of students who participated in the protests, while riot police have beaten protesters, and arrested more than 130 of them while storming and removing the encampment,\" Lucas went on. \"We have never ever been faced with such violence. We participated in the Black Lives Matter protests a few years ago, but nothing like this ever happened.\"\n\nISRAEL THE KEYWORD: The brutal killing of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2020 sparked protests across the United States against what they saw as police hostility towards black people. Demonstrators then carried flags reading 'Black Lives Matter'. American universities were provided one main venue for such protests and protesters were never met with the brute police force encountered in the Gaza protests.\n\nNeither were protests denouncing the US war on Iraq on hundreds of US campuses met with any similar repression. The protests, dubbed \"Books Not Bombs\" by the National Alliance of Youth and Students for Peace, which was formed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the US, included a series of marches and protests that were relatively controlled by the police with no violence.\n\nProfessor of political science at the University of Central Oklahoma, Hossam Mohamed, said that this time is different because the protest supports Palestinians against Israel which remains the closest US ally.\n\n\"Israel is the key word,\" Mohamed told the Weekly. \"This explains all the violence seen this time in curbing protests. The fear of anti-Semitism is deeply rooted in this country, and university administrators fear that they would be targeted as anti-Semites in case they fail to support Israel and prevent anti-Israeli protests at all costs.\"\n\nMohamed recalled an important incident to corroborate his viewpoint. \"When the president of Columbia University was questioned, a member of Congress told her that those who curse Israel would be cursed by God,\" Mohamed elaborated. \"He then asked her if she wanted God to curse Columbia University. This shows how evangelical cultural and religious trends are not only deep-rooted in American society but are also inculcated in the US political institutions, namely Congress and the White House, as well as some American educational institutions (evangelical colleges). This makes it easy for Americans to support Israel at any cost.\"\n\nFROM HAMILTON TO HIND HALL: New York Police stormed Columbia University on the eve of 30 April in an attempt to disperse protestors in Hamilton Hall, an academic building on the New York campus. The protesters were blocking entrances and raising the Palestinian flag from the building's windows.\n\nHamilton Hall was one of many university buildings which students picketed during the 1968 demonstration protesting the Vietnam War before police forcibly dispersed them.\n\nToday, in 2024, history seems to be repeating itself as student demonstrators staged a sit-in on the same premises. The protesting students raised a large banner renaming Hamilton Hall \"Hind Hall\" in tribute to six-year-old Gazan girl Hind Rajab who was killed at the hands of Israeli forces in a car with her family members in a horrific incident earlier this year.\n\nBut what's the difference between the student movement back in the 60s and current protests?\n\nPeter Kuznick, a political expert and director of the Institute for Nuclear Studies at the American University in Washington, said that \"the United States witnessed the largest wave of protests in history in the 1960s, when student demonstrations swept university campuses in protest against the Vietnam War.\"\n\n\"Today's protests, albeit growing in size, remain smaller in scale when compared to the anti-Vietnam War protests,\" he told the Weekly.\n\nKuznick applauded the student protests as a \"long-awaited\" incident but he would rather view today's student movement as a mixture of the anti-Vietnam War protests in the 1960s and anti-apartheid activism in the 1980s.\n\n\"The 1980s witnessed a number of \"encampments\" or mock shanty towns built across American universities to protest apartheid in South Africa,\" Kuznick said. \"Today, tents at places like Columbia and the University of Michigan conjure up memories of the same old tactics of that era.\"\n\nKuznick, although happy with the student protests, expressed concerns about the violent police intervention.\n\n\"Universities have a long history of violent response to student protests, but this time, it is clear that violence was hastily used to disperse the demonstrations, all despite the fact that they are peaceful and smaller in scale than those of the 60s.\"\n\nKuznick said \"the brutal police crackdown on protesters\" at the University of Texas in Austin as a case in point. \"Unarmed and non-violent student demonstrators were confronted with heavily armed riot police using batons, sticks and stun devices to disperse the demonstrations,\" he said. \"This is the first time that police responded with such violence against student protests since the late 1960s when about 500 students were arrested in Columbia in 1968.\" Kuznick cited the National Guard which killed four students at Kent University in Ohio at the time, \"and two were killed at Jackson University in Mississippi in 1970.\"\n\n\"Calling the cops to curb peaceful student sit-ins is such a despicable act,\" Kuznick added.\n\nINSPIRING STUDENTS: Leila Hadroog, a student protester from Yale University, was arrested in Connecticut on 22 April. She was in one of the campus encampments when she woke up at 6:30am only to find herself in handcuffs. The police had stormed the camp, arresting a number of students and Hadroog was one of the unlucky ones. They were all released in a few hours and asked to remove the tents.\n\nHadroog, however, remained in shock. She had always considered the university her second home, but now she feels so disappointed by \"the cheap attitude of the university administration.\n\n\"Violence and racism were so clear in the way police double-dealed with protesters,\" she told the Weekly. \"Students from different ethnic backgrounds had participated in the protests but it was clear that Muslim students were the first to be arrested, followed by coloured students and, ultimately by white students.\"\n\nJust like many fellow protesters, Hadroog was critical of the fact that the US administration spends billions of dollars in military aid to Israel and in support of the genocide in Gaza at the same time Americans are suffering unemployment, inflation and rising prices. \"And, by the end of the day, we are accused of anti-Semitism which is far from the truth.\"\n\nAdam, a student at the University of Maryland, concurred.\n\nAdam told the Weekly that \"accusing students of anti-Semitism on the part of politicians and university administrations is no more than an attempt to silence voices condoning Palestinian human rights.\n\n\"These accusations are unfounded and have been repeatedly refuted by countless Jewish fellow students on our campus who do not accept the confusion between Zionism and Judaism,\" Adam said. \"The escalation by university administrations and the police only leads to more escalations on the part of protesting students who adhere to peaceful protests to defend Palestine and reject the genocide taking place there.\"\n\nFor Adam, \"security escalations at Columbia University would only mean that students have a strong power and influence on the political scene, a matter which seems terrifying to decision makers.\"\n\nJOINING FORCES: Wednesday 1 May marked a turning point in the turbulence surrounding campus protests. Violence had been particularly intense on the eve of 1 May when riot police rounded up a number of students after storming their tents. The cries of assaulted students soon echoed on social media, pleading for help. Student pleas soon reached faculty members via social media and email and many professors decided to join forces with their students against what they saw as a clampdown on freedom of expression. This joint movement created a state of community empowerment that had many faculty members applaud it as perhaps historic.\n\nSarah Philips, an anthropology professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, says that she was in a meeting when she saw students pleading on social media. She went to see the encampments herself and found the protests were totally peaceful.\n\n\"My instincts just kicked in,\" Philips told NPR, a US independent, non-profit media organisation. \"And a few moments later, I found myself on the ground, handcuffed and being marched with some students and other faculty to a bus that was ready to take us to the local jail.\"\n\nPhilips, who was released later, was not the only case. Dozens of other university professors joined student protests at various universities, and some of them were similarly arrested.\n\nNone of them, however, seemed to regret it despite the fact that they were banned from entering the campus for a year for trespassing. Faculty members are allowed to appeal the trespass ban but they insist they did the right thing by standing on the right side and against police infringement on peaceful rights of expression.\n\nStudents organising the protests at Columbia University had earlier issued a statement which they sent via email to many faculty members explaining the situation and condemning the use of excessive force against peaceful students. The students lamented what they said was \"Columbia University's violation of campus laws by inviting security cops and hundreds of armed riot police, including the sinister Strategic Response Group, to invade Columbia classrooms, barricading students and the press alike inside the dorms.\"\n\nThe students said that hundreds were brutally treated using tasers, grenades and batons while more than 100 students were arrested. At least one student was taken to hospital for injuries from the NYPD. Video footage corroborated students' testimony showing police shoving students to the ground, students screaming and a girl pushed over concrete stairs and rushed to hospital after losing consciousness.\n\nSteve Tamari, a history professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville who was among the faculty members arrested by the police, told NPR that one student statement showed how he was \"body slammed and crushed by the weight of several St. Louis County police officers and then dragged across campus by the police\". The student, according to Tamari, \"remains hospitalised with broken ribs and a broken hand\".\n\nColumbia students, for their part, have reiterated their resilience in the face of the suppression.\n\n\"Columbia's attempt to suppress the movement will only strengthen our resolve,\" a student statement said. \"We are not done yet. There is a reason why this student-led movement is gaining unstoppable momentum on campuses around the world: because we stand on the right side of history and humanity, and we will not rest until Palestine is liberated.\"\n\n\"I feel like faculty are in triage mode right now,\" Irene Mulvey, president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) told NPR. \"They're helping the students, putting their bodies on the hot line... they're dealing with the administration with no-confidence votes, but also trying to deal with the administration directly to get them to back off and do the right thing.\"\n\nEXPLORING PROSPECTS: But how will this momentum help the Palestinian cause remains an issue of debate.\n\nPolitical researcher Zach McCurry believes that the protests will not affect the policy making of the Biden administration and those who hold current leadership positions in the United States.\n\n\"The student protests will unlikely change American policy in the short term,\" McCurry told the Weekly. \"However, their impact will be more felt in perhaps reshaping public opinion, especially among the younger generation, who did not think favourably of the US policy towards Israel before the 7 October attack and onward.\"\n\nThis positive impact, McCurry suggested, would occur in the long term in the coming years or perhaps decades but not in the coming months.\n\nPolitical expert Kuznick does not agree. He believes that the student protests have already had \"a significant impact\" on the current US political discourse, making it difficult for Democrats to keep up with Biden's comprehensive support for Israel.\n\n\"Biden has already paid a price for providing military aid to Israel, since according to statistics, 70 per cent of Israeli weapons are provided by the US,\" Kuznick explained.\n\nAccording to Kuznick, Biden has reiterated his support of Israel as America's closest ally, all despite his \"miserable attempts to steer clear of Israel's most brutal behaviour\".\n\n\"This unfortunately means that there is no space between Netanyahu's rear and Biden's lips -- a truly nauseating thought,\" Kuznik lamented.\n\nProfessor Mohamed similarly believes that pro-Palestinian sentiment has perhaps reached a breaking point in US policies.\n\n\"Americans have grown increasingly receptive to hearing and understanding Palestinian narratives,\" Mohamed explained. \"If this naked sympathy could be employed in the polls -- for example, refusing to vote for Joe Biden or other strong Democratic candidates who shower Israel with American taxpayer money -- we might begin to see a shift in American politicians' attitudes towards Israel. Biden and his allies realise this fact.\"\n\nTo corroborate his viewpoint, Mohamed mentioned Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic US House of Representatives member, and former House speaker who recently called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, calling him an \"obstacle\" to the \"two-state solution\".\n\nAccording to analysts, Democrats increasingly view Netanyahu's war as an embarrassment to them at home and a potential threat to their electoral victory. However, said embarrassment has not yet translated into calls to end military aid to Israel.\n\nRecently, the US approved a military aid bill worth $95 billion, with more than $25 billion allocated to Israel.\n\nThat said, Mohamed insists that \"the impact of this movement is strong and will create increased awareness of the Palestinian issue and more influence on the political scene in the coming years.\n\n\"The desired effect will take some time, especially since the challenges faced by students are much higher than in the case of the student protests that occurred in the 1980s against apartheid,\" Mohamed went on. \"The South African regime was more clear to Americans as a brutal apartheid rule, but for many Americans the Israeli narrative remains incomplete and unclear, and what the student protests do today is that they uncover Israel, revealing its ugliness.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

Since long before this latest wave of protests against Israeli policies at different universities in the United States.\n\nSome student revolts have had causes as lofty as world peace and goals as mundane as a decent breakfast. The first major university protest in the US occurred before the country was even founded, in 1766. The Harvard \"Butter Rebellion\" ended with half of the student body sanctioned for rising up against rancid butter. However, until after the Second World War, the university was the luxury of a few and the influence of their revolts was very limited.\n\nEverything began to change in the mid-1940s, with the return of millions of soldiers for whom the government had promised to pay for their studies: their return doubled the number of university students to two million. But the great leap was made by the generation of his children. By the mid-1960s, there were already six million on campus, and by the early 1970s, at the height of protests against the Vietnam War, there were almost ten million. An explosion that put university students at the center of the most famous era of activism.\n\nThe generation that arrives on campus in the sixties is special. The baby boomers are children of World War II soldiers: they had grown up in a victorious, wealthy country, full of patriotic pride, but also somewhat paranoid about the Cold War and where activism was viewed with suspicion.\n\nThey were going to take the opposite path: if students at Dartmouth College had assaulted their chancellor's residence in 1952 because he had limited alcohol consumption on campus, just a few years later student concerns were much more momentous.\n\nSince the early 1960s, university students have been the protagonists of some of the most notorious protests against racial segregation, such as the \"freedom rides\" in which whites and blacks crossed the southern United States together by bus. Also the sit-ins in restaurants in the South that refused to serve them in the same space.\n\nFrom these actions emerged some of the organizations that would channel student discontent during the following years, such as the Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee (SNCC) and the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).\n\nThe manifesto of this last group in 1962, for example, already included demands against militarism when there were only a few thousand American soldiers in Vietnam, but it also mentioned racial inequality, the need for democratic representation or the failures of the economic model. Although there had been small university protests in the fifties, those of the sixties were to take on a completely new scale.\n\nMany of the universities that appear in the news today as hotbeds of protests against Israeli action in Gaza are the same ones from that time: exactly sixty years ago, in May 1964, some 400 students from Columbia and other New York universities demonstrated against the city center calling for withdrawal from Vietnam and the suspension of military aid to the South Vietnamese regime, although the American presence was then 20 times smaller than it would become.\n\nFor many college students in the mid-1960s, trying to stop the war in Vietnam was a personal matter of the utmost importance. At the beginning of the conflict, university students could often get an extension and avoid going to the front, at least while they completed their studies, but as the war progressed and more and more troops were needed, all young men were at risk. His number in the draft lottery could come up at any time.\n\nThese students and their classmates, with the support of many professors, did not limit themselves to protesting against the war in an abstract way: they boycotted the recruiting services installed on campuses, they pressured their universities not to collaborate with the armed forces or industry. of defense and at the same time maintained other mobilizations in favor of civil rights, feminism, freedom of expression or labor rights.\n\nThe most tragic phase of the protests came in 1970. The maximum number of American troops in Vietnam had been reached two years earlier, with more than half a million soldiers, and President Richard Nixon had won the elections that year with the promise of a withdrawal. honorable However, when in 1970 he announced that he had ordered American soldiers into Cambodia, millions of students felt that the conflict would never end and that their chances of ending up in Vietnam skyrocketed.\n\nIn this context, a large anti-war protest was called at Kent State University in Ohio in early May. After several confrontations between the police and students, the state governor ordered the National Guard to take over the campus, and he himself traveled to Kent to warn that he would use \"the full force of the law\" against the protesters. whom he described as \"the worst type of people America houses.\"\n\nOn May 4, 1970, at noon, the National Guard began firing tear gas at some 3,000 unarmed protesters. When the soldiers failed to disperse them in this way, they began shooting with live fire into the crowd, killing four students and wounding nine others in what has gone down in history as \"the Kent State massacre.\" In the following days, 1,300 universities showed solidarity with protests and strikes. After a few weeks, Nixon called off the invasion of Cambodia.\n\nIn addition to trying to change the world, the protests of the 1960s changed many things at the universities themselves. Students at Berkeley, California, managed to overturn the rules that prevented them from protesting on campus. At others, such as San Francisco State University, student strikes forced the suspension of classes for months until those in charge agreed to hire more black and Hispanic professors and admit more students who did not come from wealthy families.\n\nMany of those protests of the time were not entirely peaceful. The students burned the military offices of several universities and destroyed recruitment centers, even attacking the military who were trying to recruit volunteer soldiers among the students. When protesters occupied buildings on their campuses as a protest or as a means of pressure, they sometimes did so armed to ensure that they would not be easily evicted.\n\nThat legacy of student activism in the US, which relaxed after the exit from Vietnam, was reborn in the 1980s with anti-apartheid protests in South Africa to force universities to sever relations with any company that continued to do business with them. the regime. It is the path that some now want to explore against Israel, although this country's ties with the US are infinitely deeper.\n\nFrom then until today, campus protests have been at the center of anti-racist mobilizations such as Black Lives Matter or those calling for gun control, such as the March For Our Lives. lives\"). Almost three centuries after the Harvard \"butter rebellion,\" university students continue to demand improvements in their living conditions, but also in the lives of everyone else.", "source":

This series of student protests are part of a larger history of student-led activism dating back to the civil rights and anti-apartheid of the 1970s. Time and again student protests throughout history have led to crucial social changes.\n\n1. The Greensboro Four\n\nIn 1960, four black college students protested segregation by peacefully sitting at a \"whites-only\" lunch counter in North Carolina, US. The movement eventually led to a wider sit-in movement organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).\n\nOn February 1, 1960, the Greensboro Four - all students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University - entered Woolworth's general merchandise store and requested service at the dining area but were denied by the staff.\n\nThe group had already alerted local media, however. A photo of the Greensboro Four appeared in local newspapers, and the protest quickly spread. Within weeks, national media coverage of the protest led to sit-ins being staged in cities across America. By July 1960, the lunch counter at the Greensboro Woolworth's was serving the Black community, and dining facilities were soon integrated in the South. The Greensboro sit-in marked an early success for the civil rights movement.\n\n2. Tlatelolco Massacre\n\nIn October 1968, when Mexico was preparing to host the Olympics, students used the global media attention to stage protests against government repression. Around 10,000 students marched on a Tlatelolco neighborhood plaza in Mexico City.\n\nThe student-led manifesto encompassed basic demands such as civil liberties and human rights including free speech. However, tanks bulldozed through the plaza as soldiers shot into the crowd. The Mexican government initially claimed around 25 people had died during the crackdown, but some experts today say forces killed as many as 400.\n\nThe massacre led to major changes in civil liberties that would expand over the next decades.\n\n3. The Soweto Uprising\n\nDuring the 1970s, the all-white government in apartheid South Africa had enforced racial segregation. The apartheid government started to issue a mandate requiring teachers to start using Afrikaans, which Black South Africans and prominent rights activists like Desmond Tutu called the \"language of the oppressor\" in class.\n\nIn response, an estimated 20,000 students peacefully marched in the protests on June 16, 1976, but apartheid South African security forces fired tear gas and live bullets into the crowd. The incident sparked weeks of nationwide protests against apartheid.\n\nThe protest was followed by an exodus of young people from South Africa as many joined the African National Congress (ANC), the chief organization resisting the apartheid government, in exile. The movement amplified the anti-apartheid sentiment that eventually ended in 1994.\n\n4. Kent State shooting\n\nFollowing the Vietnam War, President Richard Nixon issued orders to expand the fighting into Cambodia. This ignited student protests across the US, including those at Kent State University in Ohio. The National Guard troops, called in to suppress demonstrators, fired on the crowd and killed four students.\n\nThe confrontation, sometimes referred to as the May 4 massacre, was a defining moment for a nation sharply divided over the war, in which more than 58,000 Americans died.\n\nIt sparked a strike of 4 million students across the US, temporarily closing some 900 colleges and universities. The protests laid the foundation for future campus activism.\n\n5. Free Speech movement at the University of California, Berkeley\n\nIn 1964, students at the University of California, Berkeley protest restrictions on free speech enacted in earlier years.\n\nThe student protestors, later known as the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, staged a sit-in protest inside the school's administration building. Soon, colleges across the US lifted the free speech restrictions.\n\nThe Free Speech Movement at Berkeley was a watershed moment in 1960s student organizing. The movement rejected the expansion of McCarthyist-inspired rules to silent political activities on campus.\n\nAL ARABIYA", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TEMPO.CO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laila_afifa@en.tempo.co", "name": "Laila Afifa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro sit-ins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "F.

Time and again student protests throughout history have led to crucial social changes.\n\nThe Greensboro Four\n\nIn 1960, four black college students protested segregation by peacefully sitting at a \"whites-only\" lunch counter in North Carolina, US. They faced harassment and intimidation from white employees and customers but remained non-violent.\n\nThe movement eventually led to a wider sit-in movement organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), that spread throughout the South.\n\nOn February 1, 1960, the Greensboro Four - all students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University - entered the Woolworth's general merchandise store that had a dining area. They bought small items and retained the receipt as proof of purchase, before sitting down at the store's lunch counter. While Black people were allowed to enter dining areas, they were mostly relegated to a standing snack bar, as the lunch counter was reserved for \"whites only.\"\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nThe four students requested service but were denied by the staff who quickly contacted the police, but the group had already alerted local media. A photo of the Greensboro Four appeared in local newspapers, and the protest quickly spread.\n\nThe following day the Greensboro Four returned to the Woolworth's lunch counter, accompanied by some 20 other Black university students. Similar scenes were replayed on February 3-4, with protestors filling virtually all the available seats and spilling out of the store and onto the sidewalk outside.\n\nWithin weeks, national media coverage of the protest led to sit-ins being staged in cities across America. Soon dining facilities in the South were being integrated, and by July 1960 the lunch counter at the Greensboro Woolworth's was serving the Black community.\n\nThe Greensboro sit-in provided a marked an early success for the civil rights movement.\n\nTlatelolco Massacre\n\nIn October 1968, when Mexico was preparing to host the Olympics, students used the global media attention to stage protests against government repression. Some 10,000 students marched on a Tlatelolco neighborhood plaza in Mexico City until armed forces attacked.\n\nThe student-led manifesto encompassed basic demands such as civil liberties and rights including free speech, ceasing state-sponsored violence, police and military accountability, release of political prisoners and a beginning of a dialogue with the government.\n\nHowever, tanks bulldozed through the plaza as soldiers shot into the crowd. The Mexican government initially claimed around 25 people had died during the crackdown, but some experts today say forces killed as many as 400.\n\nThe massacre led to major changes in civil liberties that would expand over the next decades.\n\nThe Soweto Uprising\n\nDuring the 1970s, the all-white government had enforced racial segregation in apartheid South Africa. Until that time, many of the country's schools used English or indigenous languages for instruction.\n\nHowever, when the government issued a mandate requiring teachers to start using Afrikaans in class, students protested. Black South Africans and prominent rights activist like Desmond Tutu called Afrikaans the \"language of the oppressor.\"\n\nAn estimated 20,000 students peacefully marched in the protests on June 16, 1976, but apartheid South African security forces fired tear gas and live bullets into the crowd. The incident sparked weeks of nationwide protests against apartheid.\n\nInitial government reports claimed only 23 people were killed, but independent estimates put the death toll at almost 700.\n\nThe Soweto Uprising did a lasting damage to the apartheid government on multiple levels. It was seen by the Black youth population as a direct attack on it.\n\nThe protest was followed by an exodus of young people from South Africa as many joined the African National Congress (ANC), the chief organization resisting the apartheid government, in exile. The movement amplified the anti-apartheid sentiment that eventually ended in 1994.\n\nKent State shooting\n\nThe Vietnam War had engulfed the United States in the 1970 and President Richard Nixon issued orders to expand the fighting into Cambodia. This ignited student protests across the US, including those at Kent State University in Ohio.\n\nWhen authorities called in National Guard troops to suppress demonstrators, they fired on the crowd.Four students were killed.\n\nThe confrontation, sometimes referred to as the May 4 massacre, was a defining moment for a nation sharply divided over the war, in which more than 58,000 Americans died.\n\nIt sparked a strike of 4 million students across the US, temporarily closing some 900 colleges and universities. The events also played a pivotal role, historians argue, in turning public opinion against the conflicts in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe protests laid the foundation for future campus activism.\n\nFree Speech movement at the University of California, Berkeley\n\nIn 1964, students at the University of California, Berkeley protested restrictions on free speech that had been enacted in earlier years.\n\nThe student protestors, who later came to be known as the Berkely Free Speech Movement, staged a sit-in protest inside the school's administration building. Soon colleges across the US lifted the restrictions, ushering a new era where a student speeches were no longer governed by the authorities.\n\nThe Free Speech Movement at Berkeley was a watershed moment in 1960s student organizing which rejected the expansion of McCarthyist-inspired rules to silent political activities on campus, and won their basic rights to free speech.\n\nwith Agencies\n\nRead more:\n\nNearly 2,200 people arrested in pro-Palestinian protests across US campuses", "source": {"uri": "english.alarabiya.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Arabiya English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_arabiya_english@english.alarabiya.net", "name": "Al Arabiya English", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_counter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lunch counter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F.

It's a tempting analogy: protests in an earlier era, often defined by violent clashes with police; and the same thing today. History is simply repeating itself.\n\nNo. The recent demonstrations are nothing compared to what happened in the 1960s, when sustained, mass protests -- powered by a formidable alliance of increasingly radical activist groups -- convulsed colleges and universities across the United States for nearly 10 years. Confusing a few weeks worth of protests with the events of an entire decade is not only bad history, but could well lead to needless tragedy.\n\nThe student protests of the 1960s arguably began off campus a decade earlier, when Martin Luther King Jr. and other Black leaders launched the Civil Rights Movement. Their efforts, which ranged from boycotts to marches to voter registration drives, attracted intense, violent resistance in the South.\n\nIn 1960, four Black students at the North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College sat down at a lunch counter in Greensboro. Their dignified, non-violent resistance to segregation spurred many more protests by both Black and White students throughout the South. That same year, leaders of these protests founded a new organization: the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC.\n\nSNCC played a signal role in battling segregation and racism in the early part of the decade, culminating in the famous Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964, when it recruited hundreds of White college students from elite northern schools to come south and participate in voter registration drives. These activists returned to campus radicalized by the experience.\n\nAt the time, colleges and universities embraced the doctrine of in loco parentis, which held that students were minors lacking the kind of constitutional rights that adults enjoyed. This logic informed everything from campus dress codes to curfews to restrictions on free speech.\n\nUC Berkeley was no different, banning students from political activity. When veterans of Mississippi Freedom Summer returned to campus in the fall of 1964 hoping to recruit more students to their cause, they immediately clashed with university administrators. A bungled attempt to arrest a student for handing out political pamphlets quickly metastasized into a campus-wide crusade against in loco parentis.\n\nWhat became known as the Free Speech Movement borrowed the tactics and rhetoric of the Civil Rights Movement, engaging in civil disobedience. In a typical speech, Mario Savio, one of its leaders, declared: \"Last summer I went to Mississippi to join the struggle there for civil rights. This fall I am engaged in another phase of the same struggle, this time in Berkeley.\"\n\nThe movement quickly spread beyond Berkeley to an estimated quarter of the nation's campuses. At all these schools, universities ultimately acceded to student demands, retreating from prohibitions on political activity, and abandoning attempts to regulate students' private lives. As restrictions eased, many students embraced sexual experimentation, drugs and other taboo-breaking behaviors that would come to define the so-called counterculture.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began bombing North Vietnam and eventually committed American troops. By this time, a small but increasingly important organization -- Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS -- began to take the lead in organizing antiwar protests. At the University of Michigan, Berkeley, and dozens of other universities, SDS chapters and sympathetic faculty began organizing \"teach-ins\" consisting of lectures and class discussions about the Vietnam War that drew tens of thousands of students.\n\nAs the historian Robert Cohen has argued, these dress rehearsals for the larger antiwar movement again borrowed many of the methods of the Civil Rights Movement. And as the government began drafting men to fight in Vietnam, students on campuses across the country became increasingly radicalized, viewing themselves as part of a much larger movement that transcended any single issue.\n\nThis was the New Left: a sprawling coalition of activists dedicated to transformative social change at home and abroad. The targets of their ire reflected their sweeping ambition: Dow Chemical, President Johnson, campus administrators, university labs funded by defense dollars, the CIA, the AFL-CIO, sexist hiring, and any other institution or practice deemed complicit in injustice -- whether in Vietnam, the American South or the corporate workplace.\n\nBy 1967, the clashes between students and law enforcement had become increasingly violent. In October of that year 10,000 students from Berkeley and other campuses battled 2,000 police officers in a melee that spanned over 20 city blocks. Afterward, one SDS member exulted: \"We finally had ourselves a White Riot ... We had the streets.\"\n\nBy 1968, the Tet Offensive, as well as the assassination of King and the ensuing riots, set the stage for some of the most dramatic campus clashes in the spring of that year. At Columbia University, SDS students occupied numerous buildings, battling the police. Hundreds of other universities followed suit. By year's end, the protests had become increasingly violent. At the University of Wisconsin, students firebombed a campus building as well as a Selective Service Office.\n\nThese protests continued unabated into the next year. In the first half of 1969, at least 9,000 protests erupted on over 230 campuses throughout the country, with a fifth of these culminating in arson, the destruction of property, and occasionally, bombings. By this point, too, SDS splinter group known as the Weathermen had dedicated themselves to armed struggle, as had leaders of the Black Power movement.\n\nUniversity administrators increasingly went overboard in their attempts to curb this militancy, allowing the police to indiscriminately beat up students and professors in almost-daily clashes. These came to a symbolic end in 1970, when protests against President Richard Nixon's Vietnam policy culminated in an infamous clash at Kent State University in Ohio. There, on May 3, members of the National Guard confronting an angry mob of students fired into the crowd, killing four. In response, students protested across the United States, forcing nearly 1,000 universities and colleges to shut down until the following fall.\n\nWhich brings us to today's protests. In our own time, protest movements have generally lacked the staying power of the broad-based, revolutionary struggle of the 1960s. Yet many universities are reacting to these protests -- barely a month old as of today -- as if it's 1970 all over again, with years of protests behind them and millions of students threatening to storm the nation's campuses.\n\nThis is an overreaction that will almost certainly lead to unintended consequences. Indeed, there are signs that it already has, as videos circulate of innocent bystanders manhandled by police and indications that Indiana University allowed police snipers to set up positions on the roofs of campus buildings. UCLA allowed members of the LAPD to use rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.\n\nThis kind of escalation will end very badly. Before university boards and administrators go much farther, they may want to consider that however annoying or disruptive today's protesters may seem, the challenge they pose pales in comparison to what colleges and universities have confronted in the past. It's a reality they might do well to contemplate this summer before students return in the fall -- and before their institutions end up, like Kent State, a byword for campus tragedy.\n\n____\n\nStephen Mihm, a professor of history at the University of Georgia, is coauthor of \"Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance.\"", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Students for a Democratic Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "In loco parentis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Summer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Summer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_protest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student protest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Reject violence and hate", "body": "Free speech and freedom of assembly are foundational rights in the United States. Our college campuses must be places where young people can express themselves and gain exposure to ideas and ideologies that might conflict with their worldviews. Yet they must also be a place where students can walk on campus without the threat of violence and hatred.\n\nIn the past three weeks, we have watched what began as peaceful demonstrations turn ugly, with Jewish students and faculty targeted with threatening language, blocked from campus and, worse, assaulted.\n\nIn recent days, protesters even barricaded themselves in university buildings, damaging property and sowing chaos. The University of Texas Austin said police confiscated guns and other weapons.\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday condemned the violent protests while reiterating the rights to speech and protest.\n\nProtesters, including here at Emory University and the University of Georgia, are demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza in which at least 34,000 people, many of them civilians, have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The war was Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack inside Israel in which more than 1,100 innocent people were killed and more than 250 kidnapped.\n\nProtesters originally called for universities to support a cease-fire and to divest from companies that the protesters believe are promoting or prolonging the war. University administration support of a cease-fire won't impress Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Hamas leaders. And divestment would be nearly impossible; today's global markets are much more complicated than even 40 years ago when anti-apartheid activists won divestments from South Africa. But protesters' demands don't have to be reasonable or actionable to be constitutionally protected.\n\nMany colleges failed in their responses to the initial protests. Protest itself is not a crime and should not be treated as one.\n\nStudents who are peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights should not be ordered to leave or threatened with arrest for failing to heed a dispersal order. Colleges should have clear plans for spontaneous protests, and many do. They must also have clear and articulated plans for protests that go sideways.\n\nLaw enforcement was brought in too early in some cases, including at Emory University on April 25. Heartfelt apologies after the fact, such as the one delivered by Emory President Gregory L. Fenves, don't mitigate the damage to students forcibly removed and arrested for failing to heed a dispersal order.\n\nWhere protests became violent or when property is destroyed, such as at Columbia Tuesday night and UCLA Wednesday, law enforcement response is proper. Those who break the law should be arrested.\n\nThough abhorrent, antisemitism by itself is not illegal. Antisemitic signs and chants alone are not enough to order protesters to leave. But Jewish students - all students - must feel safe on campus. The frightening situation for Jewish students and faculty at Columbia and UCLA, among other places, cannot be tolerated.\n\nThere is a tremendous irony to calling for peace while also calling for a global intifada and death to Jews.\n\nColleges should not use peaceful protests as excuses to cancel classes or commencement ceremonies. The vast majority of a school's students are not involved in the protests and should not have their learning compromised or their graduations ruined. Many in this class of graduating seniors had their high school graduation ceremonies canceled at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe protests and sit-ins in the 1960s and 1970s didn't lead to widespread class or graduation cancellations. About a month after National Guard troops killed four people at a protest at Ohio's Kent State University on May 4, 1970, students walked the stage. Even an armed 36-hour takeover of a campus building at Cornell University in 1969 didn't lead to mass class cancellations.\n\nBut the responsibility to do the right thing doesn't fall solely on the shoulders of university administrators. Protesters have responsibilities, too. They should ensure their protests remain safe and they should prevent the infiltration of outsiders with different agendas.\n\nThough it's still unclear how involved the activists opposing the public safety training center in southeast Atlanta were with the protest at Emory, more than a few people arrested in connection with these protests were people not affiliated with the schools. Just as the Students for a Democratic Society endeavored to protect its message in the 1960s and policed its own rallies, it is in the protesters' best interest to ensure that their cause is not appropriated by bad actors. Yet, some of those arrested on campuses across the country have been found to have no affiliation with the universities.\n\nEspecially in and around Atlanta, anti-war protests are susceptible to being co-opted by the activists seeking to prevent the construction of the public safety training facility. Regardless of their ideology, the violence and destruction unleashed by those protesting the training center is unacceptable.\n\nPeaceful protests on college campus have a long and treasured history in the United States and especially here in Atlanta, the \"cradle of the Civil Rights movement.\" The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was born here in 1957 to teach nonviolent civil disobedience. It was here in Atlanta that Morehouse students Julian Bond, Lonnie King and Joseph Pierce led lunch-counter sit-ins to protest segregation. The \"Atlanta Way\" became shorthand for people working together across race and class divides to advance the common interest.\n\nYoung minds searching for meaning and order in a volatile world yearn to mold the world into a better place. Some, perhaps many, have been successful, especially when the protests seek changes at the universities or shine a national spotlight on a human rights issue. The anti-Vietnam War protests in the late 1960s and early 1970s brought the war from polite conversations and into the streets.\n\nWe stand firmly behind the rights of speech and protest. And we encourage protesters to follow the Atlanta Way.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_L._Fenves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregory L.

Some 11 days later, city and state police fired on protesters at Jackson State College, Mississippi, killing two students.\n\nThe violence in the way those events were handled galvanised public support for students, and opposition to Richard Nixon's illegal bombing of Cambodia. While public support for the students remained quite low, a massive student strike followed.\n\nPhotographs of the aftermath of the Kent State shooting captured public attention, and were at least part of the reason why some members of Congress sought to rein in Nixon's powers, by passing a law limiting the scope of the president to declare war without congressional approval.\n\nBut what are the similarities between then and now? What lessons have been learned, and ignored, from past experiences?\n\nIn UCLA, Columbia and Kent State, campus administrators claimed that calling in the police was to keep students safe. Most American universities have their own campus police, so inviting external law enforcement onto campus is an extraordinary step.\n\nHowever, it is not clear that police actions are always proportionate or effective, if their purpose is to keep all students safe.\n\nFor example, there have been accusations that police on the UCLA campus used tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters and counter-protesters, including one man being shot in the chest at very close range, as they sought to clear the pro-Palestinian encampment on May 2.\n\nThe Los Angles Police Department (LAPD) said it did not fire rubber bullets or other less-lethal rounds during this incident. However, this is not the first time that the LAPD have been accused of misusing rubber bullets.\n\nIn 2023, a man was awarded $375,000 after an LAPD officer shot him with a rubber bullet during a protest over George Floyd's death. Despite the high-profile nature of the protests, the majority of today's students have been opposed to the disruptive encampments.\n\nAccording to the recent Harvard Institute of Politics Survey of Young Americans, only 2% of young Americans cite the Israel-Palestine conflict as the issue that concerns them the most. It is possible that images of injured students in zip-tie handcuffs may change that, but it is unlikely.\n\nIn the aftermath of Kent State and Jackson State in 1970, former Pennsylvania governor William Scranton chaired a President's Commission on campus unrest.\n\nMuch of the commission's report was underwhelming, and its central conclusion -- that there was a fundamental crisis of understanding between the older and younger generations -- is trite and quite pedestrian.\n\nSignificantly though, the report debunked the idea that \"outside agitators\" were to blame for escalated violence. This trope has been much repeated by critics of today's protests, including the New York mayor Eric Adams and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the 1970 commission claimed that the root of campus unrest lay with the university's faltering moral authority -- or what some protesting students at the University of Chicago today see as hypocrisy.\n\nThen, as now, university authorities have found it very difficult to balance competing interests: freedom of speech, different constituencies of students and student activists, donors, and politicisation of higher education, including congressional interference even in private university spaces.\n\nSome universities have handled protesters better than others. Brown University in Rhode Island -- like Columbia, an Ivy League institution -- negotiated an agreement that ended the unauthorised encampment there.\n\nSeveral other universities have taken a similar approach. Indeed, Columbia itself negotiated a settlement with the anti-apartheid students of 1985, so it is not unreasonable to expect an alternative path could have been followed to defuse the current situation.\n\nLooking back to the protests of the 1960s, it's clear the campus shootings at Kent State and Jackson State were avoidable, and police and state responses did not need to be so draconian. Something that law enforcement should be keeping in mind today.\n\nCan we look to the Scranton report for lessons to inform the present day? Perhaps.\n\nThe commission's final conclusions may be even more useful now than they were in 1970s: \"The university must pull itself together... Any academic institution worthy of the name must protect the right of its students and faculty to express themselves freely -- outrageously as well as responsibly.\"", "source": {"uri":

Just over 54 years ago, on May 4 1970, the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd of anti-war protesters on the campus of Kent State University, killing four students and injuring nine. Eleven days later, city and state police fired on protesters at Jackson State College, Mississippi, killing two students.\n\nThe violence in the way those events were handled galvanised public support for students, and opposition to Richard Nixon's illegal bombing of Cambodia. While public support for the students remained quite low, a massive student strike followed.\n\nPhotographs of the aftermath of the Kent State shooting captured public attention, and were at least part of the reason why some members of Congress sought to rein in Nixon's powers , by passing a law limiting the scope of the president to declare war without congressional approval.\n\nBut what are the similarities between then and now? What lessons have been learned, and ignored, from past experiences?\n\nIn UCLA, Columbia and Kent State, campus administrators claimed that calling in the police was to keep students safe. Most American universities have their own campus police, so inviting external law enforcement onto campus is an extraordinary step. However, it is not clear that police actions are always proportionate or effective, if their purpose is to keep all students safe.\n\nFor example, there have been accusations that police on the UCLA campus used tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters and counter-protesters, including one man being shot in the chest at very close range, as they sought to clear the pro-Palestinian encampment on May 2. The Los Angles Police Department (LAPD) said it did not fire rubber bullets or other less-lethal rounds during this incident.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that the LAPD have been accused of misusing rubber bullets. In 2023, a man was awarded US$375,000 (\u00a3298,000) after an LAPD officer shot him with a rubber bullet during a protest over George Floyd's death.\n\nDespite the high profile nature of the protests, the majority of today's students have been opposed to the disruptive encampments. According to the recent Harvard Institute of Politics Survey of Young Americans, only 2% of young Americans cite the Israel-Palestine conflict as the issue that concerns them the most. It is possible that images of injured students in zip-tie handcuffs may change that, but it is unlikely.\n\nLearning from the past\n\nIn the aftermath of Kent State and Jackson State in 1970, former Pennsylvania governor William Scranton chaired a President's Commission on campus unrest. Much of the commission's report was underwhelming, and its central conclusion - that there was a fundamental crisis of understanding between the older and younger generations - is trite and quite pedestrian. Significantly though, the report debunked the idea that \"outside agitators\" were to blame for escalated violence. This trope has been much repeated by critics of today's protests, including the New York mayor Eric Adams and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the 1970 commission claimed that the root of campus unrest lay with the university's faltering moral authority - or what protesting some students at the University of Chicago today see as hypocrisy. Then, as now, university authorities have found it very difficult to balance competing interests: freedom of speech, different constituencies of students and student activists, donors, and politicisation of higher education, including congressional interference even in private university spaces.\n\nSome universities have handled protesters better than others. Brown University in Rhode Island - like Columbia, an Ivy League institution - negotiated an agreement that ended the unauthorised encampment there. Several other universities have taken a similar approach. Indeed, Columbia itself negotiated a settlement with the anti-apartheid students of 1985, so it is not unreasonable to expect an alternative path could have been followed to defuse the current situation.\n\nLooking back to the protests of the 1960s, it's clear the campus shootings at Kent State and Jackson State were avoidable, and police and state responses did not need to be so draconian. Something that law enforcement should be keeping in mind today.\n\nCan we look to the Scranton report for lessons to inform the present day? Perhaps. The commission's final conclusions may be even more useful now than they were in 1970: \"The university must pull itself together... Any academic institution worthy of the name must protect the right of its students and faculty to express themselves freely - outrageously as well as responsibly.\"\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The majority of demonstrations have called for the divestment from companies that support Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nOne day after the protests began, the university authorized the New York Police Department (NYPD) and more than 100 of the protesters were arrested right away. Said nabbing triggered a movement on college campuses across the country, including at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and the University of California, Los Angeles. On April 30, about 300 student protesters were arrested in a raid in Columbia and the City College of New York. The next day, law enforcement apprehended at least a dozen people at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nAs final exams and graduation approaches, school administrators are pressured to return order in schools. Police are all out in the arrests. According to the Washington Post, police have dispersed campus rallies with tear gas in Florida. In Wisconsin, photos showed officers detaining a Madison professor with blood smeared on his forehead. In California, masked men attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment on a Los Angeles campus and students criticized police for not intervening sooner.

And we also have to condemn hate. ... That is something that this president believes.\"\n\nLast week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned pro-Palestinian protests at American universities and called them \"horrific.\" He calls for them to \"stop\" the protests and he called the students involved as antisemitic.\n\n\"What's happening in America's college campuses is horrific,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"Antisemitic mobs have taken over leading universities. They call for the annihilation of Israel. They attack Jewish students. They attack Jewish faculty. It's unconscionable. It has to be stopped.\" (Related: Israel wants U.S. National Guard deployed against anti-Israel protesters at American universities.)\n\nIn a video released online, Columbia President Minouche Shafik expressed how the last two weeks were \"among the most difficult in Columbia's history,\" in connection to the Gaza solidarity protests happening in the university that has led to arrests and some, violent interactions between the demonstrators and law enforcement.\n\nShafik added that the turmoil, tension, division and disruption have impacted the entire community. She put it out there that the students have \"paid an especially high price\" by losing out on the final days of the year in classrooms and residence halls.\n\n\"For those of you who are seniors, you're finishing college the same way you started: online,\" she stated. \"We tried very hard to resolve the issue of the encampment through dialogue. Many of the people who gathered there were largely peaceful and cared deeply about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\"\n\nAccording to Shafik, the issues that are currently challenging the public, such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, antisemitism, anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias, have existed for a long time.

Demonstrations led the university to end classified war research and stop military recruitment, among other changes, wrote Rosalind Rosenberg, a professor of history at Barnard College, for Barnard Magazine.\n\nAnd as a growing list of recent protests involve arrests of students, USA TODAY Network revisited four milestone protests on campuses in New York during the Vietnam era to explore how universities repeatedly emerged as epicenters for American activism.\n\nUniversity at Buffalo: Vietnam draft protests in 1968, the 'Buffalo nine'\n\nAs opposition to the Vietnam War mounted, groups of University at Buffalo students came to the support of activist Bruce Beyer, whose draft opposition attracted national attention in 1968.\n\nAfter publicly burning their draft cards, Beyer and a second man entered the Unitarian Universalist church on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo to claim symbolic sanctuary against arrest for draft evasion, according to the university's archives.\n\nFBI, U.S. marshals and Buffalo police entered the church and arrest Beyer, as well as eight of his supporters after a brief fistfight with the police and federal agents. This group, later known as the Buffalo Nine, would be charged with assault, and Breyer's trial, which ended with his conviction and three-year prison sentence, sparked months of chaotic and, at times, violent protests at the public university in Buffalo.\n\nThe handling of protests on the campus in Buffalo marked a milestone moment in New York and the nation's debate about academic free speech protections at public universities, which continue today.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War protests: Did SUNY Purchase, New Paltz protest arrests violate free speech protections?\n\nUniversity of Rochester: Vietnam protests against napalm maker, Kent State shootings in 1960s, 1970\n\nStudents at the University of Rochester became one of the early college groups to stage protests of Dow Chemical Corporation -- the makers of napalm for the Vietnam War -- in the late 1960s, according to the university's archives.\n\nThat movement followed prior anti-napalm research and demonstrations that began in 1966 at Midwest colleges, including the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, the then-home state for Dow Chemical, according to those colleges' archives.\n\nThen, in 1970, the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester played host to a pair of concerts mounted in the Eastman Theatre with a special purpose: to raise funds for the national circulation of an antiwar petition written by two faculty members, according to the school's archives.\n\nThe two concerts represented the climax of anti-war activity at the college -- that is, in protest of American involvement in Vietnam -- mounted by Eastman School students in the weeks following the tragedy that would become known simply as Kent State, in which authorities open fired into protesting students, killing four young people.\n\nProtest laws: SUNY Purchase, New Paltz college protests: What's legal and what's not? What experts say\n\nCornell University: A 1968 campus building takeover by armed students\n\nAt 3 a.m. on a spring night in 1968, a burning cross was discovered outside Wari House, a cooperative for black women students at Cornell University.\n\nThe following morning, members of the Afro-American Society occupied Willard Straight Hall to protest Cornell's perceived racism, its judicial system and its slow progress in establishing a black studies program, George Lowery wrote in the Cornell Chronicle.\n\nLaw enforcement from Rochester, Syracuse and other upstate locales promptly responded to the Ivy-league campus in Ithaca.\n\nFollowing negotiations with Cornell officials over the next 36 hours, the students emerged from the building carrying rifles and wearing bandoleers. Their image, captured by Associated Press photographer Steve Starr, in a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, appeared in newspapers across the country and on the cover of Newsweek magazine under the headline, \"Universities Under the Gun,\" Lowery added, noting the episode came to symbolize an era of social change.\n\nCollege protests: Why are students protesting in NY and around the nation? Here's what shaped today's movements\n\nSyracuse University: Student strikes in 1970\n\nBeginning on May 4, 1970, Syracuse University students participating in the National Student Strike held teach-ins and sit-ins, according to the university's library website.\n\nThe SU students marched, erected barricades and caused damage to campus, negotiated with the university administration, and made their voices heard. Although the strike ended at the close of the 1970 spring semester, the impact of this student-led protest was felt for years to come.\n\nSome of those ripples of change affected the way decisions are made on the campus today, the library exhibit noted, and the educational opportunities available, in many ways, have been fundamentally informed by the activism and engagement of the student strike and other student movements of that period.", "source": {"uri": "democratandchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democrat and Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In what has turned out to be a spontaneous mass upsurge, hundreds of students have been protesting on university campuses across the country against the ongoing Israel's war in Gaza. The scale and intensity of the demonstrations are reminiscent of the campus unrest of the Vietnam War era and more recently the 'Never Again' campaign in 2018 spearheaded by students seeking gun control laws. The ongoing pro-Palestine demonstrations in over 120 universities and colleges across the US represent collective social outrage over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following relentless military strikes by Israel. The demonstrators have been demanding that the US should halt all forms of support to Tel Aviv, including an end to US military assistance to Israel, university divestment from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and amnesty for students and faculty members who have been disciplined or fired for protesting. The protests reflect that young Americans are more likely to oppose Israel's actions than the older ones. A survey in March found that 55% of Americans disapproved of the Israeli military action in Gaza, with 63% of them in the age group of 18-34. While the protestors are well within their right to freedom of expression, the campaign appears to be crossing the limits at some places with incendiary slogans being raised targeting Jews. Some irate anti-Israeli demonstrators vandalised a World War I memorial and torched an American flag at Central Park in New York.\n\nThe mass protests driven by a just cause should not be reduced to a hate campaign. Already, some Jewish students have called the protesters anti-Semitic and expressed concern about their safety. An aggressive crackdown by administrators and the police in the form of arrests, suspensions and class cancellations has only complicated the situation. Even prestigious universities like Harvard, Columbia and Indiana have floundered in dealing with the protests and have hastily called in the police to handle the situation. Though the US boasts its rich traditions of free speech and expression, its track record in handling mass protests has not been very encouraging. The administration and the police have a tendency to overreact. American students have a long history of rallying behind social and political causes. They were at the forefront of the anti-segregation movement in the 1950s and 1960s; they protested Free Speech limitations in Berkeley in 1964, thereafter the Vietnam War, apartheid in South Africa and gun violence in their own country. The Biden Administration, which is largely seen as a firm supporter of Israel, has failed to handle the situation with sensitivity and maturity. Under pressure from the left wing of the Democrats, Biden has backed students' right to protest, \"but not the right to cause chaos and violence\".", "source": {"uri": "telanganatoday.com",

The protests against Israel's war on Gaza on campus have grown since last October, each version met with increasing escalation from the university administration. Organised by Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a student umbrella group, their goal is to put pressure on the university to divest from organisations which benefit financially from the occupation of Palestine.\n\nThe students built an encampment in the middle of April, declaring it a \"Liberated Zone\", disrupting the normal affairs of the college through avowedly non-violent resistance. Camps have sprung up at universities all over the country and abroad. Evicted once from the lawn, students then occupied a university building, renaming it \"Hind's Hall\" in honour of Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed by the Israel Defense Forces. On April 30th, hundreds of heavily armed and armoured riot police from the NYPD, accompanied by tank-like military vehicles, stormed the campus at the invitation of the university president. They arrested more than 100 people, including students and staff, some violently.\n\nColumbia is not alone. Student protests have taken place in hundreds of US universities, leading to the arrests of more than 2,300 people on campuses, according to a tally by the Washington Post. Violence against pro-Palestinian protesters was even worse at UCLA, where counter-protesters were allowed to attack peaceful encampments with bear spray, fireworks and wooden planks while police stood by, arresting only those protesting for a ceasefire in Gaza. The following day, California police returned in force, shooting protesters with rubber bullets and arresting many.\n\nThese occupations call to mind the tactics of the decade of protests in the 2010s\n\nStudent occupations are nothing new, but this level of police repression, in collusion with administrators, is. In the 1980s, students at Columbia protested for the university to divest from Apartheid South Africa. They occupied the very same Hamilton Hall and were ultimately successful.\n\nThese occupations call to mind the tactics of the decade of protests in the 2010s. It's hard to look at rows of tents and human chains and not be reminded of Tahrir Square in 2011 or Zuccotti Park during the Occupy NYC movement later that year. They have learned from their predecessors, as have the authorities. The strategy from universities, the police and politicians appears to be to meet mild provocation with maximum force, in an attempt to strangle the movement before it can grow. The university is deploying not only riot police but also tactics of suspension, expulsion, eviction and lawfare, trying to not only break the protesters' wills but ruin their lives too.\n\nFar from being naive idealists, the students are clear-eyed about the state of affairs on campus. What they have understood that has yet to sink in for the world at large is how elite universities themselves have been transformed. They have moved from being primarily educational institutions to something like diversified corporations, enormous bureaucracies with vast endowments, staggering property interests and deep connections to industry and military interests. Picture a lab that receives millions from international defence contractors, not a tweed-jacketed professor teaching Chaucer. They operate as managed democracies, where real decisions are beyond the power of staff or students.\n\nThe protests have spread to universities in Australia, the UK, France, Canada, Mexico, and Ireland\n\nEmblematic of this is Columbia's embattled president, Minouche Shafik, an administrator who made her career not as an educator but at large global institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, before taking the top job at the London School of Economics. Her choice to crack down hard and invite police on to campus seems driven by a fear of large donors deserting the institution, and a personal desire to avoid being drummed out by right-wing politicians in Congress, like her peers at Harvard and Penn.\n\nThe protests have spread to universities in Australia, the UK, France, Canada, Mexico, and Ireland. The newly radical Trinity College Dublin Students' Union set up an encampment last Friday, after it was revealed that the college was attempting to levy a \u20ac214,000 fine on the union for revenue \"losses\" incurred during previous protest actions, and even to hold individual students financially responsible.\n\nThese tactics appear to have backfired, and a war of words has ensued in student inboxes between the union, led by its president L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1rfi and Trinity provost Linda Doyle. On Monday, following a fourth day of protest, the university said it would pull its investments in Israeli companies that feature on a United Nations \"blacklist\", a process it said would be completed by June, while a taskforce to explore engagement with Israeli institutions is to be set up.\n\nHaving initially appeared to portray the encampments as a threat to public safety, or worse yet, the God-given right of an American tourist to pay \u20ac25 to gawk at the Book of Kells, the university said that \"in view of the disproportionate response\" seen at some institutions overseas, it was committed to addressing the \"encampment as an internal process.\" \"We fully understand the driving force ... and we are in solidarity with the students in our horror at what is happening in Gaza.\"\n\nContrary to the condescending coverage of the students as reactionary and simple-minded, their demands are reasonable and deeply researched\n\nThe union characterised the communication as a \"partial victory\", but added that it was committed to continuing until all its demands were met in full, including an amnesty for protesters and the rescinding of the \u20ac214,000 bill. Another meeting between management and students was due to have taken place on Tuesday.\n\nStill, there remained a sense that the reasons why the students, from New York to Dublin, were doing this were lost in all the back and forth. Despite the late, reluctant opposition of most of the world's leaders, Israel continues its brutal war in Gaza, this week apparently in the early stages of a truly catastrophic invasion of Rafah that would almost certainly kill tens of thousands. And we, through our taxes, the usage of our airports, the compliance of our politicians, our silence, let it happen.\n\nContrary to the condescending coverage of the students as reactionary and simple-minded, their demands are reasonable and deeply researched.\n\nThey have made it clear that their voices will not be shamed, badgered, bribed or even -- in the case of students at some US universities -- beaten into silence.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, May 8th, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations that began at Columbia University have ignited a wave of similar protests at colleges and universities across the country. Weeks into it, those protests only seem to be intensifying. Thousands have now been arrested. The students demands vary by campus, but the majority are asking for an end to the Israel-Hamas war and divestment from companies that are financially benefiting from the conflict. In decades past student activism regarding the Vietnam War, Civil Rights, and South Africa's Apartheid successfully sparked broad social and political change as the student-led movement breached the tipping point. To put the current protests in context, I'm now joined by Robert Cohen, Professor of Social Studies Education at New York University, and a scholar in student activism. Thanks for joining me, Robert.\n\nSo let's dig right in. This is both a volatile and a rapidly evolving situation, but let's take a step back for a minute and put these demonstrations into context. Are you seeing and hearing the kinds of things that might lead to lasting change? Have we reached the tipping point yet?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, I think it has raised more awareness about the war than the US support for the Israeli military in the war. So I think that's probably significant. I think it's more likely to have that kind of impact than the demands that they have for university divestment. Mostly because unlike say, the divestment demands in the eighties over US investments in connection to the apartheid regime in South Africa, there was nobody in the eighties in the United States, practically no one who supported apartheid is racist. Whereas in the United States, there's considerable support for Israel.\n\nAnd so in fact, there are 30 plus states that have laws against state agencies doing business with companies that have been part of the BDS divestment movement. So I'm only a handful of universities across the country, even maybe even less than a handful have actually divested. So I think that's going to be a much tougher... there's a tougher demand that was made back in the eighties on apartheid, but still, I would say it's a little bit like the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, which weren't a student movement so much. They had a student wing, but they were so anarchistic, they didn't have a demand. So you can say, well, that they were a failure, but really they helped to change the conversation about economic inequality.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhat kinds of science do you look for in a student led movement that signal the onset of real change?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, I think it's a question of is the issue that they're promoting, is it getting more discussion? I mean, the more concrete way, sort of a more effective movement, the terms of its more local demands, are they winning? Are they changing the universities? Like the Free Speech Movement of 1964 asked that the restrictions on student free speech rights be eliminated. And that took a semester of some of the largest protest and the largest mass arrest in American history in UC Berkeley to win that demand. But that's kind of unusual.\n\nStudent movements usually don't win their... it's very rare that they win their demands. And so I think the question is what's the broader impact and a certain sense, like say during the Vietnam era, the student anti-war movement raised awareness of the problems with the war. And so you could say that it helped to turn the country against the war, but even more unpopular than what the war became after the Tet Offensive in 1968 was that student movement was always more unpopular than the war that it was opposing because American society is basically conservative culturally and doesn't think that students should be engaged in protest activity for reasons I can discuss with you. But so I would say they're always a mixed bag in terms of their impact, their success in a way they kind of boost the left, but in a way, the resentment against them boosts the right.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWell, as you know, several universities have successfully negotiated deals with protest leaders, Brown and Northwestern among them. Is there something about the culture on these campuses that encouraged successful dialogues?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, I would just say that's very unusual. In fact, why is it that students are often out in the streets or in the campuses either doing encampments or just mass demonstrations? Because basically on most college campuses, students are pretty much disenfranchised. If you don't like President of the United States or your senator or congressperson, you can vote them out of office. But if you don't like the investment policies of the university, you don't have any... you're a student, you have no role. You're not consulted.\n\nAnd in fact, a lot of the universities have said like mine at NYU and Columbia said, \"No, we won't do this,\" right? Where more inclusive, if the governance of the university was more open to students and more well had some democratic element in it, they would say, \"Okay, present your evidence to the board of trustees,\" and there might even be a student on the board of trustees, which there are not on private universities, but at least we'll listen to you. And most universities aren't willing to do that. So Brown and Northwestern, they're the exceptions, and I think they show that if you have a process like that, you don't need to have demonstrations. So they help to end the demonstrations by actually involving students in decision making, even though they didn't promise they're the best.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nOne of the most heated debates of these protests is free speech versus hate speech. I know you've written extensively on the free speech movement in the sixties at Columbia. USA Today has interviewed quite a few Jewish students who are taking part in the pro-Palestinian protest, whereas on some campuses such as UCLA, there have been protests of students who are pro-Israel and some were quite violent. Why is free speech so fiercely defended on college campuses? Can you please put that into context for us?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, a university is really about the free exchange of ideas. And in terms of the politics and society, it's supposed to raise uncomfortable questions. And so if we're going to go on the basis of what's popular and only allow popular speech, university's not going to be able to fulfill its social function. And that's the key reason why you want free speech on campus is so you can pursue truth. That means two opposite views of the war. If you only have one side, you may not be able to arrive at that right? It's just what everybody assumes is right like the Vietnam War, the dominant view was this was a just crusade against communism, but the anti-war movement on campus said no. It raised questions. And I think 20 years later, a lot of people are willing to say, \"Hey, the movement was right about that.\" They wouldn't have been able to have aired that view if free speech had been denied.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nUniversities' tactics in dealing with the encampments and the protesting students vary fairly widely from campus to campus. Some campuses have seen arrests, some suspensions, some police forces have deployed riot control agents like tear gas. Many of these approaches seem to only escalate tensions. Where's the line historically been that separates peaceful protest from ones that are endangering the safety of other students and the community?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, mostly the line is called time, place, and manner that as you have the right to free speech, but you can't disrupt the basic educational function of the university. So once you've done that, taking over a building or blockading a classroom, that's really problematic like what happened at Columbia when they took over Hamilton Hall. That's a violation of time, place, and manner. But the earlier protests on the lawn where just people sitting on the lawn is not disruptive, and the fact that those were suppressed is kind of, I think an overreaction and is very uncommon. That was not done in the sixties. In fact, in 1970 or late sixties, if you had done something like that, that would be seen as being very moderate and the college president would be relieved that you're not trying to take over the administration building or firebomb the RTC building or something like that. So what I'm saying is that the university has become, I think, less tolerant of dissent and is kind of pushing that line about what constitutes disruption. They're pushing that to the right.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nProfessors and school administrators at Columbia and several other campuses have come out in support of the protesters in some cases physically creating a barrier between police and the encampment. This isn't the first time that's happened though. Historically, how has this played out?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, like Columbia in 68 when they were protesting against the war and against the poor relations between Columbia and the local black community, when the police were coming, faculty did put themselves out in front like line up to try to prevent the police from suppressing the protest. But it doesn't work. I mean, because the police are going to come and arrest whoever's in their way. In fact, there's a famous case, University of Wisconsin, when they were protesting against Dow Chemical, which was recruiting on campus, and they manufactured napalm, which was a chemical weapon used in Vietnam, which killed a lot of civilians and there was basically a police riot. The police were beating up the protesters, and one of the students came in, some of the students came in to the professor's office, a sociologist, and they asked him to come out and he came in and thought, well, he was so naive at that point, because this is really early in anti-war movement, he thought that he could tell the police to stop beating up the students and the students to go home.\n\nAnd there's a famous photo when he did that. He's talking to one police officer telling them to stop it and telling the students go home. Another police officer didn't hear it and tries to hit him on the head and the students kind of jump over him. And it's a famous photo of showing in a sense how naive it was, but how ineffective the faculty are when they try to protect the students. It's notable that they try to, but they don't have any more power actually than the students do really, unless they change university policy in the vote of the Academic Senate.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe question of who's funding these protests has been a contentious one. What do you know here and what's been the history of protest funding in the past?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nTo me, that's like a red herring. Students are out there because they're upset about the war, all the civilian casualties that come to them instantly on social media. They're not coming because someone's funding it. I mean, people can contribute whatever, but you don't need much money to go out and sit out on the lawn or sit in. All during the sixties, those kind of charges were made like Moscow Gold, the students are getting aid from communists. But the CIA investigated that under President Johnson and they said, \"No, they're not like communist directed. The students are not dupes of the Communist Party.\" And Johnson was unhappy with that result. So he never publicized the study that came up much later, but I think that's an outside agitator argument. It's not nonsense because there can be some people outside who join in demonstrations or people who contribute money, but it's not being funded. And the idea, I've read things about people on the right saying that Soros is funding this, that's just like anti-Semitic nonsense. I mean, there's not any example of mass protest in the country that's being created by outside funds.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSome college administrators are saying that non-student agitators are adding fuel to the fire, co-opting the movement for their own goals. Is this a valid concern or do outsiders, have they historically played a minor role?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, I think again, it's like trying to blame people who are not on campus for what's something you don't like on campus. If you have a demonstration that's organized from the campus and it marches like here to Washington Square Park that's off campus, people off campus have a First Amendment right to join a demonstration. And unless you're saying I have to check IDs, which is, that was done at the encampment here, but not during mass demonstrations. So there will be people because the public concern about the war in Gaza is not restricted to the campuses.\n\nSo I think we shouldn't get hyper or paranoid about outsiders coming in. Although it is true. I saw in Columbia that there was one long-time outside radical who was involved, but again, that's not the students do what they want to do. In fact, actually in the sixties, there's a good expression, Jack Weinberg and the Free Speech Movement had when they were trying to blame the student protest movement on elder communists. He said, \"We have a saying in the movement, don't trust anyone over 30.\" And really that wasn't even a saying, and it was then you used to talk about the generation gap in America more broadly, but he was just trying to say, \"We run our own movement.\" And that's generally true of student movements in the United States. There's not really any student movement I can think of, and I've been studying it for decades, you could say, was produced by some outside agitators.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nIs there anything else that we didn't touch on that you'd like to add before we go?\n\nRobert Cohen:\n\nWell, I think the unpopularity of the student movements, not just this one, but all of them. That is, if you think about it, the sit-in movement in 1960, the Freedom Riders in 61, the Free Speech Movement in 64, the anti-war movement against the Vietnam War all were unpopular, underwater in terms of their polling. And why was that? I think because the basic cultural conservatism of our society thinking that students really should obey their elders, study, and be seen and not heard. It's like it doesn't matter what the students are asking for, it's always going to be unpopular, and they're all often going to be caricatured in the press. Like today, people saying like you were implying, \"Oh, this is something funded by Hamas or something, or some outside agitators are making it happen.\" That's a way of acting as if the students can't think for themselves.\n\nOr the idea that there was a cartoon in The Washington Post the other day that made it before any violence happened on campus, how do we suppress these violent movements when they're not violent. And they're basically, most of them have been nonviolent. There've been a few exceptions. So I'm just saying that there is a tendency to really be dismissive of student protests because students are kind of getting out of their lane. And I just want to say that it would be nice, I think if people were try to resist that kind of strong social pull to do that and try to just look at the students objectively. This movement for all its flaws and it has them, is really about stopping killing, stopping war, and what would we rather have? The piece of the graveyard where nobody dissents? I think that's really problematic. I think I'd rather have a college generation, even when it makes mistakes be trying to mobilize against war and killing.\n\nThanks to our senior producers, Shannon Rae Green and Bradley Glanzrock for their production assistance.

Image courtesy: George Mason University\n\nEncampments, chanting, protests, a cancelled graduation ceremony, police force clearing out demonstrations: All these words describe the past few weeks of Columbia University and other Ivy League schools.\n\nTop US universities witnessed massive pro-Palestinian demonstrations that amassed thousands of students demanding their educational institutions to financially divest from Israel.\n\nThe protests came at a time when most colleges were in the middle of conducting final exams. The chaos was so profound that authorities had to take the extreme step of calling the police to quell the protests. This eventually led to the arrests of hundreds of students.\n\nAmid all this, David Bernstein, Professor of Law at George Mason University, told Firstpost that students who are participating in these protests should instead take full advantage of their educational course, get a degree, start a company and be successful enough to have real influence over the world.\n\n\"Frankly, the amount of influence you're going to have as a student protester relative to the potential cost to yourself in not taking full advantage of your educational opportunity is just I just don't see how the calculus would be. Yes, I'm a physics graduate student, and I want to start my own tech company. But instead, I'm going to be living in an encampment on campus. I just don't see the payoff there. If you feel very strongly about it, get your degree. Start your company. When you're a billionaire, you can have a lot more influence on the world,\" he said.\n\nWhile Professor Bernstein firmly believes that students have the right to protest on campus, there should be a certain level of limitation that must be practiced in such cases.\n\n\"There's a right to protest on campus, either from the US Constitution at public universities or through the student handbook rules of private universities. However, the recent protests have often violated school rules in a variety of ways,\" the professor said.\n\nDescribing the on-ground situation, Professor Bernstein said that many student protestors were found blocking the paths of others or harassing or threatening students who did not wish to partake in protests.\n\n\"And more recently, we've had these encampments where students have basically taken over, usually a prominent part of campus, and often refuse to allow other students to enter without their permission. My position as a professor is you have every right to protest on whatever issue in whatever way you want, but you don't have the right to break the rules or infringe on the rights of others,\" he said.\n\n'Different elements of student bodies joining protests'\n\nWhen it comes to understanding the purpose behind the protests, Professor Bernstein thinks there is more than just one student body at play.\n\n\"I think there are different elements within the student body. The protests are typically organised by a group called Students for Justice in Palestine. And these are the hard-core anti-Israeli. They support Hamas and while they don't take direct instruction, Hamas would often reach out to these groups to organise demonstrations,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Bernstein added that there's another group of \"political activist\" students who join the protests without realising what the cause is.\n\n\"There are some students who are just, 'This is what's happening.' They want to be part of it. A lot of people, they're just there. 'This is a fun, interesting thing happening.'\"\n\nHow do professors navigate during protests?\n\nWhile questions have been raised on students' right to protest and how a university should respond in such cases, professors are faced with a much bigger problem, evaluation and grading.\n\nA lot of students have demanded the cancellation of exams and asked their professors to grade them A.\n\n\"It's difficult for professors to evaluate students with so much ruckus on campus. I think I would distinguish between two groups of professors. One group of professors is overtly aligned with the protests. The ones who say, 'I want to cancel classes or not have exams in solidarity.' I think that's wildly inappropriate,\" Bernstein said.\n\nThe other group of professors, according to Bernstein, are the ones who are genuinely concerned about their students and cannot expect them to perform at their best especially when their campus is not accessible.\n\nAt the same time, it is virtually impossible for universities to alter their academic calendars in response to protests. Several reports suggest that the demonstrations were funded by pro-Palestinian groups, indicating that they were planned way ahead. However, Berstein says that educational institutions like Columbia cannot simply change their routines in the face of widespread protests.\n\n\"It's been very difficult because you have to deal with dorm space and professors' schedules. I do think that in Columbia's case and other cases too, the universities were too tolerant of rule-breaking back starting in the fall,\" he said.\n\nThe professor added, \"I think what should have happened very early on is for all universities to make very clear statements. 'You're allowed to protest. You're allowed to have even noisy protests but you have to do it within the reasonable time, place, and manner of rules that we already have.\"\n\nDoes a professor's bias affect teaching?\n\nIn times like these, when the entire campus unites on one side of the issue, it becomes particularly challenging for professors not to advocate their biases in their teachings.\n\nTalking about this, Bernstein said, \"I'm outspoken on one side. I'm on the pro-Israel side. I take it as some students feel like, 'Oh, you're somehow being anti-Muslim or anti-Palestine or anti-Arab.' But I think that one should avoid trying to paint other groups with big brushes.\"\n\n\"I saw someone I know who was a law professor, retweeted something, referring to students on their campus as \"Zionist thugs.\" And all the students were doing was a peaceful counter-protest. I'm not saying that professors should necessarily be punished, but I would think that one should not engage in rhetoric like that, especially about students who may want to stop by your classes because it's very hard to imagine how you'd be a neutral professor, especially if you teach classes in that area,\" he added.\n\nWhat about foreign students?\n\nAt times like these, foreign students, including Indians, are the ones who become the most apprehensive about their participation. International students studying at leading US universities have a lot at stake, be it their visa status or finances.\n\n\"When you're living with a student visa in the US, you have conditions on that visa. And the conditions in the US are very hard. You actually have to go to school, you have to not break the law and not support terrorism. And you have to agree to all those things,\" Professor Bernstein said.\n\nHe said that more foreign students are found to be protesting and flouting rules might lead to a reduction in the issuing of student visas in the future.\n\n\"It's often hard to avoid peer pressure one way or the other. But when you lose your visa or when you never get your PhD, they're not going to be there to help you. So you have to take yourself outside the moment and think, well, what is best for my future or not? What are my friends pressuring me to do right now?\" the professor said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bernstein_(law_professor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Bernstein (law professor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Mason University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Students for Justice in Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Arabism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Arabism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_student", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International student"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-09T201345.620-2024-05-ea8cd03598a44e0bad9140f175f64185.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545228", "eventUri": "eng-9545228", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

They Want to Be Heard", "body": "In the final weeks of this tumultuous academic year, colleges and universities across the country have erupted in renewed protest against Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip. At Columbia University, on April 18th, school officials tried to shut down a student tent encampment by enlisting the New York Police Department, which then arrested more than a hundred protesters. The administration's move not only further emboldened activists at Columbia but also sparked a national uprising of students to end the war in Gaza and, for some, to end their institution's financial ties to Israel. Since then, more than two thousand people have been arrested on at least forty-six campuses in the U.S. (At Princeton University, where I am a professor, I have participated in antiwar activities in recent weeks.) Student protests continue at schools that are still in session. This youth revolt will linger as a backdrop to the Presidential election, threatening Joe Biden's bid for a second term.\n\nFor months, pundits have identified Biden's underwhelming polling among young voters as a problem as he continues to lag behind Trump. In 2020, Biden rode a wave of anger expressed by younger constituents, who had been filling the streets in some of the largest protests in U.S. history. He won the election, in part, with nearly sixty per cent of the youth vote. But today's youth have Biden, not Trump, as the focus of their demonstrations. As the U.S. persists in its provision of weapons to the Israeli military, Biden has been described as \"Genocide Joe\" and hounded during public appearances. Only eighteen per cent of young voters approve of the way he is handling the war in Gaza. Though some Democrats may believe that, if Israel ends the war by the fall, students will move on and recognize Trump as the larger threat, the ways in which their demonstrations have been denigrated, disbanded, and denounced as antisemitic will not easily be forgotten.\n\nFor months, university presidents have been under the glare of Republican-led congressional hearings for what conservatives broadly deride as pandering to a contingent of students radicalized by \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" and \"grievance\"-studies programs that view the world through the lens of \"oppressed\" and \"oppressor\" frameworks. This, the G.O.P. complains, has created a hostile environment for conservative students and is now posing unique threats to Jewish students. The danger to university administrators is real, as evidenced by the resignations of the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, soon after their appearance before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and by legislation in Texas, Florida, and Utah forbidding public colleges and universities from providing any services related to D.E.I. As if to dispel any assumption that they are woke-coddling, permissive administrators of campuses run amok, college presidents have responded to the recent protests with disproportionate force: students have faced cops in riot gear wielding tear gas, pepper spray, tasers, and batons. When administrators at Columbia University called the N.Y.P.D. onto the campus to end the student occupation of Hamilton Hall and tear down the encampment, a SWAT team was part of the action.\n\nStudents who engage in civil disobedience do so with the expectation of some reprisal. That is, after all, the moral imperative at the heart of this particular form of activism: self-sacrifice in the name of a higher political goal. But many of the student activists had not anticipated being arrested; they were shocked when set upon by police aggressively seeking to clear an area or simply to forbid public demonstration. In some instances, schools enacted last-minute changes to their policies in response to student protests, making the encampments or other practices against the rules. The University of Indiana, where law enforcement dispatched what appeared to be snipers to the roofs of campus buildings, changed its rules regarding tents on campus one day before students created encampments on school grounds. (The State Police superintendent later said that the rooftop officers \"weren't intended to be sniper positions. They were over-watch positions.\") Whatever the cause of arrests, the punishments pursued by school administrations have been excessive and cruel. Students and faculty members who have participated in the protests have been suspended and banned from campuses, and evicted from university housing, before disciplinary proceedings have begun. Some have been expelled; others have been banned from graduation ceremonies, have faced uncertainty about their legal records, and have generally been treated as pariahs. The level of repression has been shocking.\n\nThe crackdown on Palestinian-solidarity activists has exposed the limits of the right's hypocritical crusade for the expansion of speech rights on campus. In the past several years, Republicans in Texas have described a war against free speech on college campuses and declared themselves the catalyst for changing it. The University of Texas at Austin went so far as to even protect the rights of students to engage in \"hate speech.\" As one official said, \"Imagine if the government at the whim of a political party could just decide at any time what constitutes hate speech, and then just start arresting people for engaging in it.\" Although hate speech may be allowed, Palestinian solidarity is apparently viewed as a threat. This past March, the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, signed an executive order that directed colleges to update their free-speech policies to \"address the sharp rise in antisemitic speech.\" It also pledged to \"stand with Israel\" and to insure that \"groups such as the Palestine Solidarity Committee and Students for Justice in Palestine are disciplined for violating\" those policies. When, in April, antiwar students gathered to march on campus, they were met by state troopers in riot gear and police officers who deployed pepper spray and flash-bang explosives. Dozens were arrested. U.T. Austin's president, Jay Hartzell, claimed that the police action was pre\u00ebmptive, intended to stop students from \"using the apparatus of free speech and expression to severely disrupt a campus for a long period.\"\n\nIn mid-March, House Republicans began advancing the Respecting the First Amendment on Campus Act to staunch what they saw as \"the longstanding and pervasive degradation of First Amendment rights.\" The bill encourages colleges and universities to enshrine the so-called Chicago Principles for free speech, which say, in part, that universities should not \"attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.\" Then, reacting to the encampment at Columbia University, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican senators Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Josh Hawley, of Missouri, called for Biden to send in the National Guard. The double standard can hardly be lost on students. Liberals and conservatives appear to converge on believing that the strongest protections for speech are afforded only to those causes with which they agree. Those who oppose the efforts of the students dismiss complaints about the suppression of speech by simply declaring the students to be antisemites.\n\nIt is not only the G.O.P. peddling these misrepresentations. In his first statement about the resurgent protests, Biden said, \"I condemn the antisemitic protests,\" as if there were no need to differentiate between antisemitism and criticism of the state of Israel. And in response to the building occupation at Columbia, a White House deputy press secretary, Andrew Bates, released a statement that said, \"Forcibly taking over buildings is not peaceful -- it is wrong. And hate speech and hate symbols have no place in America.\" Bates added, \"President Biden has stood against repugnant, antisemitic smears and violent rhetoric his entire life.\"\n\nAs has become all too typical, there is no effort to acknowledge the leading role in the movement played by Jewish students. Five days after the first crackdown at Columbia, hundreds were arrested at a Passover celebration organized by antiwar Jewish groups near the Brooklyn home of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. This, of course, does not mean that there have not been incidents of antisemitism in any of the protests, which cumulatively include thousands of students across the country. But characterizing the protests as prima facie antisemitic has been a way to discredit the movement. And, for all the public concern expressed about the well-being of Jewish students, there has been a near-absence of concern or media coverage about the health and safety of Arab or Muslim students. (The Council on American-Islamic Relations says that it received more than eight thousand complaints of anti-Muslim bias last year, almost half of which came in the last three months of the year. This is a fifty-six-fold increase from 2022 and the highest number of complaints lodged in twenty-eight years -- even more than following 9/11.)", "source": {"uri": "newyorker.com", "dataType":

Austin.\n\nOn Wednesday, the New York Times reported that 2,700 people had been arrested or detained on campuses across the country.\n\nSimilar scenes have played on in Europe, where students have set up encampments and are also calling for universities to cut ties or divest from Israel.\n\nIn Amsterdam, police clashed with protesters, arresting around 125 students, as they tried to clear out student barricades. German police also cleared an encampment where hundreds of students were protesting.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Complutense University in Madrid, where students remained camped out, a group of musicians and

According to the Bangladesh-based New Age, other demonstrations were held at universities in Jahangirnagar, Chittagong, Comilla, Rajshahi and the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.\n\nSignificant numbers of students also protested at Shah Azizul Haque College in Bogura and Mymensingh's Agricultural University. Palestinian students enrolled at these universities and university lecturers also participated.\n\nThe students at the rallies and marches carried banners with slogans such as \"Free Palestine, Stop Genocide! Down with Zionism! Ceasefire in Gaza now!\" The rally at Dhaka University, which was joined by several university lecturers, was under the banner \"Solidarity with Free Palestine Movement in American Universities!\"\n\nSolaiman Khan, a 23-year-old Dhaka University student, told Arab News: \"The US and some other big players always speak in favor of freedom of speech. But what we have seen at university campuses in the US is a shame for all world leaders.\" He added: \"The youth [of Bangladesh] have come onto the streets against this sort of hypocrisy from the superpowers of the world.\"\n\nAnother student said: \"We are here for the basic human rights of Palestinian people, for liberty, peace, harmony and justice. We Bangladeshis know about war, we know about peace, we know conflicts and sufferings, we know the tragedy of colonisation, occupation, suppression and repression and we [know] the sufferings of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIssaq Nomura, a Palestinian studying in Bangladesh, told the Dhaka Tribune, \"The first protest started at Columbia University, spread to universities across the USA and is now at universities all around the world. We stand today in solidarity with these people [students]. I want to shout my heart out to students back in my home Palestine. There are 300,000 Palestinian students in Gaza who cannot go to their schools or their colleges or universities.\"\n\nMonday's nationwide demonstrations were preceded by an anti-genocide protest by Dhaka University students on Sunday.\n\nMosaddek Ibne Mohammad Ali, who attended that event, told the media: \"What Israel has been doing to the people of Gaza is clearly a war crime and genocide. The Netanyahu administration has violated all the humanitarian laws. This illegal war must be stopped for the sake of humanity.\"\n\nHe condemned the Biden administration's unwavering support for Israel and recalled previous US imperialist wars: \"They violated the laws of democracy in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and now they are violating democracy in their own country [by] attacking and imprisoning the students.\"\n\nDhaka University law professor Nakib Mahmud Nasrullah supported the demonstration declaring that Israel's genocidal attacks on Gaza were a global question. \"It is not just an important issue for Muslims to stand with the people of Palestine... Netanyahu and Biden are the direct supporters of this war and they are war criminals.\"\n\nThis week's protests were mainly organised by the Bangladesh Students' League, the student wing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling Awami League. Its president, Saddam Hussain, read out a \"Memorandum of Peace\" at the end of Monday's protest at Dhaka University.\n\nThe memorandum condemned the witch-hunting of students at US universities, noting the students were defying \"intimidation and repression, demanding divestment from the arms that fill the machinery of oppression and genocide...\"\n\nIn line with the Awami League's pro-capitalist policies, Hussain made a futile appeal to the \"world leaders,\" including the US and other major powers, for peace. But these are the very same forces who fully support and provide billions of dollars in weaponry for the Netanyahu regime's criminal war. Hussain called for these imperialist powers \"to stand in solidarity with the oppressed, to fight for justice, peace and equality... now.\"\n\nAddressing a press conference on May 2, Prime Minister Hasina also criticised the arrest of the US students as a \"breach of human rights\" and questioned whether it was \"part of the US democracy.\" Hasina's comments about \"human rights\" and \"democracy\" are completely hypocritical and exposed by her government's repression of opposition parties and its violent assaults on the basic rights and jobs, wages and living standards of Bangladeshi workers and the poor.\n\nBangladeshi student protests are an expression of the growing global opposition of young people and workers against the bloody war being carried out by the fascistic Netanyahu regime, backed to the hilt by the imperialist powers. Campus university encampments and other protests have spread across the US and to Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Spain, Rome, Japan and Lebanon and continue despite police crackdowns.\n\nSo far, about 2,500 US student protesters have been arrested on false allegations of violence in the US, but all the violence is being perpetrated by the National Guard and militarised police in riot gear, to break up the university encampments. Similar police attacks have been reported in France, Germany and the UK.\n\nHowever, to end the genocide in Gaza, requires a revolutionary perspective and program.\n\nThe International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) and the World Socialist Web Site have called on students to turn to the international working class, the only social force that can halt the Netanyahu regime's criminal attacks, the NATO-led war against in Russia in Ukraine and rapidly escalating preparation for a US-led military conflict with China.\n\nThe WSWS is providing extensive coverage of the student protests globally, including live updates, and outlining a revolutionary socialist and internationalist perspective to prevent a catastrophic war between nuclear-armed powers. We urge Bangladeshi students and workers to regularly read and circulate the WSWS.\n\nRead morePolice raids, mass arrests of anti-genocide protesters continue at campuses in NYC and beyond following

While some of the most egregious behavior has come from local and state police -- such as placing snipers on the roof of a building overlooking protests at Ohio State and Indiana University and the violent mass arrests of peaceful student protestors at Columbia, City College, and University of South Florida -- university-based police departments have played their part too. And they have shown themselves to be just as capable of brutalizing students and faculty as state and local police.\n\nAmong the more egregious incidents, we have seen campus police join with official law enforcement to violently arrest students and faculty at Emory, the University of Illinois, and the University of Texas. At UCLA, university police stood by as an encampment was overrun by violent counter-protestors.\n\nThe history of campus police goes back to 1894 and the emergence of a watchman-like system at Yale. These watchmen were granted the legal powers of municipal police and were able to execute arrests and use force as necessary, differentiating them from security guards who generally are unarmed and must rely on local police to make arrests. Modern campus policing as we know it, however, emerged for the most part much later in the 1960's and '70s, in the wake of the violent police repression of student protests in those decades. During that era, universities invited law enforcement onto campuses, where they famously brought the heavy weight of their force down onto students -- from the arrests of Free Speech Movement protesters in Berkeley to the NYPD's violent attack on students at Columbia to the killing of four Kent State students by Ohio National Guard troops\n\nIn response, beginning in the 1970s, universities decided to follow a different approach to campus unrest: Rather than deploy local police who worked at the behest of city officials often wanting to \"send a message\" to protestors, universities developed campus police forces that, at least in theory, would be under the direct control of administrators and thus able to provide a more nuanced, preventative, and less violent approach to campus protests. The hope was that this would minimize disruption to campus life, restore legitimacy to university administrations in the eyes of students, parents, and the general public, and give schools more resources to protect campus infrastructure.\n\nTo justify these new and expanded campus police forces, university officials invoked the rhetoric of local control and community service. They argued that that having a police force under the direct authority of college administrators would reduce the level of violence around policing protests because these forces could be more proactive and preventative rather than reactive and retributive. By being a full-time presence on campus, they could channel protest activity into approved methods that didn't disrupt college operations and didn't require the involvement of outside police forces.\n\nIn practice these new forces tended to be a lot like their municipal peers. Headed up and staffed with officers from surrounding departments, they shared the same training and worldview as police generally. As recent research by Samantha Simon in Before the Badge and Michael Sierra-Arevalo in The Danger Imperative shows, this training and worldview instilled in them a deep culture of fear that bred a high level of defensiveness, suspicion, and unwarranted use of force. They viewed disruption as inherently threatening to the social order and thus worthy of criminalization. As with other police forces racism and sexism also became rampant.\n\nDuring the last two decades, these campus police have become even more like local police. As a new volume Cops on Campus, edited by Yalile Suriel, Grace Watkins, Jude Paul Matias Dizon, and John J. Sloan, details: campus police have largely followed the rest of policing in becoming more warrior-like since 9/11. Many university police departments have formed tactical squads and received military surplus equipment from the Department of Defense's 1099 weapons transfer program. A 2016 Associated Press report found that campus police departments across the country have obtained assault rifles either through the 1099 program or through direct purchases. It also disclosed a DOD report that 91 campus police departments had obtained over 800 rifles in the prior decade. While most departments refused to disclose direct purchases, the University of Wisconsin-Madison reported spending $11,000 on AR-15s in 2010 with plans to purchase more in the following years.\n\nUnder normal circumstances campus police play two primary roles, one is the protection of university resources and property and the other is the protection of members of the campus community -- that is, students, staff, faculty, and administrators. Most of this work involves the surveillance and harassment of those deemed outside the campus community. In 2018, for example, Portland State University police operating off campus shot and killed Jason Washington, an unarmed young African American man involved in breaking up a fight. Police fired 17 rounds, striking him 9 times. Students had opposed giving PSU police firearms in 2014 raising concerns about exactly such a scenario.\n\nCampus police have not reserved their force only for those deemed outside the community, however. During the Occupy protests, University of California Police subjected UC Davis students to direct application of pepper spray in a video that became a viral meme at the time. There have also been cases where police have racially profiled non-white students and even arrested, brutalized, and shot them -- including during mental health crises. In 2010 University of Florida police shot a graduate student in the face and hand causing permanent injuries. This March, a Washington State University officer shot at a student having a mental health crisis. As is too often the case, the student called for help and was greeted with armed police instead of a mental health response.\n\nUniversity police forces have also been expanding in recent years as their campuses expand into surrounding communities. Both the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University Police Departments were given permission to expand policing into surrounding communities where the universities have extensive real estate interests and in the process subject local residents, many of whom are poor and non-white, to an additional layer of intensive policing. In an essay for the Cops on Campus volume, the scholar Davarian Baldwin argues that this is in keeping with the larger vision of the neoliberal university and its efforts to expand research, medical services, and urban redevelopment without regard to their impact on displaced communities.\n\nBy unleashing both campus and other police forces on student protestors, administrators are making the same mistakes they made in the past. They are brutalizing their students and faculty -- the very communities that define their institutions as \"universities\" and as a result, are contributing to a legitimacy crisis that runs the risk of escalating into a profound crisis of confidence in universities. Already, we have seen commencement ceremonies canceled at USC and Columbia as well as the cancelation of in-person classes and campus services at Columbia, UCLA, and City College of New York.\n\nOver the last several years student movements across the country have called for an end to campus-based police forces. They want all cops off campus -- university affiliated and municipal. Students at Portland State successfully de-armed their campus police and students at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins partnered with community-based organizations to oppose police expansions.\n\nIn 2022, a \"Cops off Campus\" coalition was formed that links these efforts together across the United States and Canada. The presence of armed police on college campuses, they insist, has done little to enhance a university's public safety and instead serves as a private army to be used by administrators to advance institutional interests that often clash with the well-being of students and surrounding communities. When push comes to shove, campus police are no better than their off-campus counterparts and should be disbanded. The existence of campus police forces are a profound threat to our social movements and exist primarily to enable the ongoing work of the neoliberal university that places a significant burden on surrounding communities.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type":

In Oxford, tents have been pitched on grass that, in ordinary times, no student is allowed to walk on. The ground outside King's College in Cambridge looks like Glastonbury, complete with an 'emergency toilet' tent. Similar camps can be found at UCL, Manchester University and more. There have been no clashes with police, but that may yet come. In Leeds, for example, pro-Palestinian students tried to storm a university building, leading to bloody clashes with security guards.\n\nFrom the Sorbonne to Sydney University, the movement has gone global. Its ostensible cause is hardly ignoble. It's possible to be appalled both by the 7 October attacks and the tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths. It would be inhumane not to share the widespread horror at what is happening in Gaza. And anti-war rallies have, of course, long been part of the student experience, a hallmark of a free society. (I should know: as an undergraduate, I travelled to London to march against the Iraq war.) But the sight of some of the most privileged young people in the West calling for 'global intifada' and, in some cases, explicitly expressing their solidarity with Hamas indicates how easily these protests have been instrumentalised for more extreme causes.\n\nThe recent escalation started when Minouche Shafik, the politically savvy president of Columbia University in New York, sought to make clear that anti-Semitism has no place on campus. She's an economics professor whose CV includes important stints in government, running the UK's Department for International Development as a permanent secretary and serving as a crossbencher in the House of Lords.\n\nWhen called to give evidence to Congress at the end of April, she didn't want to repeat the mistake of her colleagues at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, who had so egregiously failed to take a firm line on anti-Semitism a few months earlier that they found themselves out of a job. She vowed to enforce her university's rules with a firm hand. But students determined to challenge her authority responded by erecting tents on Columbia's campus. When Baroness Shafik delivered on the vow she had made to Congress by calling in the NYPD to clear the encampment, she set off an even bigger protest movement. Copycat encampments quickly spread to around 50 American universities and beyond.\n\nFor the most part, protestors pitch tents in common spaces on campus, limiting themselves to chanting slogans meant to shock and provoke. At many universities they've also occupied administrative buildings or prevented classmates from moving around campus or going to the library. In response, a growing number of American university presidents have called in the police: more than 2,000 protestors - many of whom turned out to be outside agitators with no university connection - have been arrested.\n\nWhen students rebelled in the 1960s they embraced plenty of dumb and dangerous causes, from Fidel Castro to the Cultural Revolution. But their anger proved long-lasting in part because so many had skin in the game. They chafed at open censorship on college campuses and the strict restrictions on their sex lives. Most importantly, many had good reason to fear being conscripted into fighting America's disastrous war in Vietnam.\n\nToday, students are once again horrified by a bloody conflict in a faraway land. This hurt goes especially deep for students who have links to the region, though most protestors lack such a personal connection. Unlike in 1968, none of them have to fear being conscripted into taking part in the conflict. And it is the scions of the white middle-class who seem especially prone to the most radical and nihilistic forms of oppositional politics. Key organisations supporting the protests, such as Students for Justice in Palestine, explicitly celebrated Hamas's terror attack in the days following 7 October.\n\nThere's another contrast between 1968 and today. Back then, the establishment the students were targeting felt a res-ponsibility to uphold order and defend tradition. Nowadays, many professors and administrators see themselves as the natural inheritors of the student movement. Many leading universities describe the events of 1968 with a mix of pride and nostalgia, and actively market themselves as great places for political activism. A New York University website targeting prospective students, for example, features a three-part series about how they can learn 'what progressive change is like in action'. Many universities offer scholarships explicitly targeted at activists and admit students in recognition of their high-school activism. Once students arrive on campus, they find that a majority of staff locate themselves far to the left of the average citizen.\n\nThis helps explain some absurdist moments we're seeing. Protestors who had occupied a key administrative building at Columbia held a press conference demanding that administrators deliver food and drink to them. When a surprised journalist asked why the university should have such an obligation towards people engaged in blatantly illegal activity, she insisted they had a moral right to 'basic humanitarian aid'. We saw similar developments at British universities, with student unions giving out free drink vouchers, and protestors demanding the institutions against whom they are ostensibly rebelling keep them warm and comfortable.\n\nProtestors who have occupied university buildings and yet expected administrators to deliver dinner to them may have fallen prey to delusion; but if so, it's one that their universities have proactively nurtured. At Oxford, for example, nearly 200 dons expressed their solidarity with the encampment, describing it as 'a public-facing global education project'. When powerful constituencies within the university celebrate students for breaking its rules, it's hardly surprising that students might feel betrayed when they suffer punishment or face arrest.\n\nEvery parent knows that the best way to enforce rules on their children is to be clear and consistent: children need to know exactly what they are and aren't allowed to do. And when they break the rules, consequences should follow.\n\nUniversities have in recent years increasingly acted in loco parentis, treating students as children who need to be cajoled, indulged and most often of all mollified. (That mollification explains how the student editors of the Columbia Law Review can earnestly urge the school to cancel exams because the police's 'violence' in clearing their encampment left them 'irrevocably shaken'.) But especially when it comes to free speech, the rules universities have set are deeply inconsistent and the consequences for breaking them erratic.\n\nUniversities claim to follow two sets of rules concerning free speech. To ensure academic freedom, students and faculty members are supposedly entitled to engage in controversial speech, even if many consider it offensive. Especially in the US, which has a more absolutist culture of free speech, this has traditionally extended to positions, such as a denial of the Holocaust, that would in some European countries be illegal.\n\nThe second set of rules is meant to uphold public order on campus, making it possible for students with widely divergent views to get along. No student has a right to stop their classmates from attending the lecture of a controversial visiting speaker, to occupy the president's office or to destroy the university's property as part of a protest. The tradition of free speech has never included a right to exercise the heckler's veto.\n\nThe problem is that universities on both sides of the pond have failed to honour or enforce these rules. In particular, they've become far too restrictive when it comes to controversial speech - and far too lax when it comes to punishing blatant rule-breaking.\n\nMIT disinvited a speaker who was going to give a talk about climate change because he opposed affirmative action. Harvard allowed one of its departments to hound out a lecturer because she publicly professed her belief in the existence of biological sex. NYU now prints a phone number on its student IDs that encourages community members to call a bias response team in case they overhear a 'microaggression'.\n\nThe double standards which have resulted from this are evident. For example, a Columbia student went on a daft rant a few years ago, talking drunkenly about why 'white people are the best thing that ever happened to the world'. He was immediately condemned by the university and even banned from parts of the campus. And yet, five years later, the university tolerates hundreds of students chanting slogans that glorify and even call for violence, such as 'globalise the intifada'.\n\nAt the same time, many universities have signalled to their students that they will never seriously discipline them for shouting down classes, occupying campus buildings or tearing down statues of controversial historical figures. Calling the police on protestors has, at many universities, become altogether taboo even when they clearly violate the law. And so the past decades have seen a steady rise in disruptive forms of protest on campus.\n\nEvents by visiting speakers couldn't go ahead due to the threat - or the reality - of violence. Some university presidents accepted that students would lay siege to their offices for weeks or months on end. During the Occupy Wall Street movement, tent encampments popped up, and stayed put for weeks, on multiple campuses. In Britain, students have similarly felt emboldened to break the most basic rules set by universities. At the beginning of March, for example, a group calling itself Palestine Action proudly shared a video of one of its members spraying red paint and slashing a painting of Lord Balfour at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nAs the situation grew ever more volatile - and, in some places, violent - university presidents attempted to restore order through negotiation, the threat of expulsion and finally the police. For the most part, long-standing university rules, and even the principles of free speech, entitled them to take these actions; but since they had for so long established the norm that students can break rules and occupy university buildings at will, many pro-Palestinian protestors understandably perceived this as heavy-handed and hypocritical.\n\nOne of the many problems with straying from principle when times are calm is that you have nothing to fall back on in times of crisis. Since 7 October, universities have achieved the seemingly impossible: giving both Jewish and pro-Palestinian students reason to feel that they have been treated unfairly. Over the past months, Jewish students understandably felt abandoned because they alone had to endure hate speech targeted at their group without administrative intervention. Now, pro-Palestinian protestors feel unfairly targeted because, in a breach of recent precedent, their encampments have, in some instances, been broken up by the police.\n\nTo avoid similar omnishambles in the future, universities should publicly commit themselves to upholding both free speech and public order. But it's probably too late for principle to save them from their current troubles. For now, they're condemned to look like hypocrites whatever they do - because, due to the failures of the past few years, they are.\n\nWith the Israeli military advancing in Rafah, the protests may grow in size and become more unruly in the coming days and weeks. And yet, it seems unlikely they will last forever. That's partially because university leaders have grown surprisingly willing to call upon the police to end illegal encampments. But it's mostly because, in a few weeks, the academic year will end at many universities - and most student activists don't want to cancel the exciting trips they have planned or to forgo prestigious summer internships.\n\nThis year will most likely not turn into a rerun of 1968. But, at least in the US, there may turn out to be one important parallel. At the end of that tumultuous year, Richard Nixon, promising to put an end to the disorder in the country, beat Hubert Humphrey in the presidential elections. At the end of this year, Donald Trump, taking a page out of Nixon's playbook, may just succeed in repeating the same feat.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator

They are protesting against the support being given by their government to Israel, which has been emboldened to wage a genocide of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe US students are demanding that their universities break ties with institutions in Israel and divest from the country. They are aiming to create pressure that they believe will end the violence against Palestine.\n\nThe administrations of their institutions and their government have responded with ferocity. Rubber bullets, tear gas and batons have been used on students protesting peacefully. Many have been arrested. Many have also been given expulsion notices by their universities. Teachers supporting them have also been beaten, arrested and punished in other ways.\n\nWatching all this on her phone, my daughter said that it reminded of what happened in her own country, India. The response of the police in the US is similar to how our own police acted against students in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University protesting against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act in 2020.\n\nIt is not just the police in India who have attacked students. Students opposed to government policies have also faced assaults from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which is the parent of the BJP. The Parishad has also committed violence against teachers.\n\nSimilarly, in America, supporters of Israel have attacked students. Just as the police in India were silent, the police in the US also watched the protesting students being beaten up. In addition, a section of the US media is not only unsympathetic to the protests, it is actively criticising them.\n\nThe pretext for suppressing students in America is that the demonstrations are anti-Semitic. This ignores the fact that the protesters include a significant number of Jews.\n\nIsraeli author and columnist Gideon Levi has noted that the lie is being propagated that the protests are spreading hatred against Jews. He noted that Columbia University student Nova Obrock, who is Jewish herself, had written in Haaretz that she felt no fear at the demonstrations.\n\nThis reminded me of the 2020 protests at Jamia and Aligarh Muslim University and later at Shaheen Bagh, which were similarly accused of inciting violence against Hindus.\n\nAs I was writing this piece, I read something that made me think about the similarities between US President Joe Biden and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath. Biden said that protests were fine but destruction of property could not be allowed. He is for protest but against disorder. He knows well that protests are meant to disturb the order of injustice.\n\nDespite the crackdown, America's students and teachers have continued their protest against the genocide. In the face of threats of losing their jobs and being expelled from the university, they are standing firm. Some who were students in the 1960s are reminded of the way they had raised their voices against the US government demanding an end to the Vietnam War. Some of them are taking part in these protests today, offering their support by attending the demonstrations.\n\nWhile the students have been standing firm, the university authorities have shown how petty and cruel they are. The idea of American universities being an abode of free expression has been shown up for what it is: an illusion. The claim that freedom of expression is America's most sacred principle has been exposed as a big lie.\n\nAmidst the gloom, it is uplifting to learn that the Evergreen State College of Olympia in Washington has ended all relations with Israel. Twenty-one years ago, a student of this college named Rachel Corrie left home to support the Palestinians in their struggle for their rights. Corrie stood in front of a Palestinian home to save it from an Israeli bulldozer. An Israeli bulldozer crushed her to death. Having decided to stand with the Palestinians today as Israel massacres them, the Evergreen State College can now proudly say that it is Rachel Corrie's college.\n\nThe universities of America are doing their duty. What is a university but its students and teachers? Universities are the heart of society and its moral compass. When power or authority are in conflict with justice and society loses its way, universities show them the path ahead.\n\nAmerica's educational institutions can say with some satisfaction that during the Vietnam War and the genocide of Palestinians by Israel, they rang the bell for justice. That their administrators compromised with injustice is another matter.\n\nAlong with campuses in America, students in Europe and other countries are also protesting against Israel and their governments. This is a politics of sympathy, a politics of unconditional solidarity with those who are different from us, with whom we do not share anything but our humanity.\n\nMany friends are asking why Indian campuses of India have been silent. They have missed some campus responses. At the end of April, the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University protested against a planned visit of the US Ambassador to their campus. They hoped to convey their disapproval of his country's involvement in the genocide of Palestinians. As a result, the ambassador had to cancel his plans.\n\nSimilarly, at Jindal University, students and teachers organised discussions against the genocide of the Palestinian people. They faced punitive action from the authorities. We heard about similar attempts at the IIT, Bombay, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Hyderabad Central University.\n\nBut these have been exceptions. It is true that Indian campuses are mostly indifferent to the question of Palestine.\n\nFor now, most Indians are focussed on the general elections in our country. Despite this, there should be no conflict between our concern for ourselves and our solidarity with others. We do not need to solve all our problems before we worry about others. India's freedom movement is a living proof of this.\n\nThere is still time for India's students and teachers to prove that their commitment to the values of justice and equality is not a mere formality.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Lorde noted that this filled her with both a sense of dread and a sense of urgency. Dread and urgency, once again, have driven students across campuses in the United States to protest against the catastrophe in Gaza. During the anti-apartheid protests calling for divestment at campuses in the late-1980s -- when we ourselves were students -- university administrators were embarrassed about aligning with the White apartheid state of South Africa. Today, with Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism so normalised in the U.S., university administrators are proudly aligning with this genocidal war. Armed police guard our libraries, check-points have been placed across our campus and we are learning that a police siege of our campuses is the new normal in the modern U.S. university.\n\nStudents are educating each other\n\nAcross the country, student protesters have a unified set of demands: Disclosure and divestment in corporations complicit in weapons manufacturing and the Israeli occupation of Palestine; \"Cops off Campus\"; and protecting pro-Palestinian speech and activism across the university. The call for divestment can be traced to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement beginning in 2008 that was inspired by the anti-racist, anti-apartheid student movement that Audre Lorde was addressing. The call for \"cops off campus\" can be explained by the abolitionist critiques of the police as a racist institution amplified in the wake of the George Floyd protests of 2020, along with the fact that this generation in universities today were mobilised into activism against the gun violence that has plagued them in schools since childhood. Finally, the call for the protection of pro-Palestine speech and activism is a reflection of the history of university administrators' complicity in the \"Palestine exception\" to academic freedom made especially evident since October 2023.\n\nIn New York University (NYU), our students, whose leadership includes African-American, Arab-American, South Asian and anti-Zionist Jewish students among a multi-racial coalition, are educating each other on the history of the Levant and its diverse peoples and traditions in the region and the diaspora. They are convening teach-ins on the legacies of colonialism and racial violence and the fraught complexities of historic Palestine, post-Balfour, post-holocaust, post-Nakba, post-Oslo. They are studying apartheid as a technology of governance from native reservations, to apartheid South Africa to Jim Crow America, to settler colonial rule from Palestine to Kashmir. They are analysing the necessary distinctions between Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism, between criticism of racism against Jewish people and criticism of the ethno-state of Israel. They are also learning about the history of Palestinian resistance -- of political campaigns such as BDS and the Great March of Return, of the poetry of dissent by Mahmoud Darwish and Mosab Abu Toha, from the theatre of the oppressed to the Freedom Theatre from the Jenin Refugee Camp, of the meaning of terms that have been demonised by the U.S. and western media, such as intifada and 'from the river to the sea'. They are studying the political economy of occupation and the money trail from Washington to Tel Aviv to Riyadh, from corporations' profits from Israeli settlements to our university donors and trustees, from the university investments to the war that is being waged on the other side of the globe. The teach-ins and 'people's universities' are about students taking back their right to education, speech and dissent from a history of repression of Palestine solidarity in the U.S., including, and perhaps especially, in our classrooms and campuses.\n\nUniversity clampdowns\n\nFrom the beginning of the war, many university administrators began instituting disciplinary procedures against expressions of pro-Palestine solidarity and activism directed against the state of Israel, while banning local chapters of national organisations such as the anti-Zionist Jewish group, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). As the war escalated, student protests proliferated, and university surveillance and crackdown of protests became ever more punitive. Meanwhile the Joe Biden administration doubled down on support for Israel's war effort and right-wing politicians convened congressional hearings with university presidents to interrogate them on campus political culture. It is in this context, six months after the war began and even as the number of dead in that period had climbed to over 33,000, that students, feeling unheard and muzzled, channelled their protest into peaceful encampments in their universities. Even as the repression intensified, these de-occupation encampments spread to campuses across the country.\n\nThese protests can be situated in the specifics of the current historical conjuncture, but the use of the term \"de-occupy\" also speaks to a larger analysis of the university's role in colonial, imperial and corporate extractivism. Thus, it invokes the histories and geographies of American military occupation from the American Indian Wars, to the occupation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, to U.S. meddling in Haiti and across the Americas to the wars of Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. In New York, this movement echoes the Occupy Wall Street Movement of 2011 against the grotesque inequality of U.S. society. These students know there is a bloody connective tissue between the economic and the military, between the war and the siege, between the bombs and the famine. But this is not just a New York moment. From the University of Florida, to the University of Texas, from Emory University in Atlanta to Cal State Sacramento, the students chanting for divestment and against Israel Defense Forces abuses come to those demonstrations with deep knowledge about the history of racialised police brutality. Across the country, it is a movement that has been shaped fundamentally by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movements that seek to dismantle the U.S. policing apparatus that disproportionately surveils, arrests and jails Black and Brown communities. Similarly, the Standing Rock movement against the Dakota Access oil pipeline that travelled through first nations territory, was crucial in raising generational awareness about settler colonialism and the links between the U.S. and Israel as settler colonial states, and the links between occupation and dispossession. Social media savvy and alert to the narrative wars, these students are raising the alarm, refusing big media spin and forging solidarities from Georgia to Gaza, Harlem to Hebron.\n\nRadical futures\n\nWe write this in the wake of the NYU administration calling on the New York Police Department to arrest NYU students in a violent invocation of the strong arm of the law as the partner to the McCarthyite surveillance and stifling of campus speech. Rather than shedding light on this repression, the conservative and liberal media have together platformed university administrators overseeing the corporatisation and militarisation of higher education. From coast to coast, our students have risked and endured suspensions and arrests in resolute solidarity with the people of Gaza. They have used their privilege as students in the heart of empire to expose and disrupt the ideological and economic ties that bind the American university to the forces of genocide. In turn they have been inspired by struggles in historic Palestine and the Palestinian diaspora, those who studied and taught in all the bombed out schools and universities of Gaza that exist today only in peoples' memories and their visions for a future in a free Palestine. In this they have joined Audre Lorde's radically hopeful vision in that same piece that we cited at the beginning: \"We can join together to effect a future the world has not yet conceived, let alone seen.\"\n\nPaula Chakravartty is James Weldon Johnson Associate Professor of Media Studies at New York University (NYU).

Some people find these deaths to be abhorrent and are speaking out in an effort to stop the killing and destruction. Johns Hopkins University has not escaped the pro-Palestine demonstrations that have occupied colleges and universities.\n\nAt campuses across the nation protesters have gathered and encamped, demanding, among other things, that universities divest their investment of substantial endowment funds from Israeli companies and those doing business with them.\n\nThe Hopkins' demonstrators are demanding that the school cut all ties with Tel-Aviv University.\n\nIn some cases there has been hate speech aimed at Jews, or Israel as a nation, and calling for violence, sometimes invoking Germany's mass murder of Europe's Jewish population. Make no mistake; the threats or invocations of violence are intolerable to this board. They are hate speech, unprotected under the First Amendment on college campuses and elsewhere because their words are likely to incite violent acts, not because they express a particular view.\n\nSome of the protests, however, do not call for violence although they demand that universities meet their demands. Some demonstrations are orderly, some less so when they break into campus buildings or otherwise serve to prevent non-protesting students, being the vast majority of the school population, from attending their expensive classes or participating in graduation ceremonies.\n\nWe need to question whether the acts of merely assembling where universities say students should not assemble, without more egregious conduct, are sufficient to cause some universities to invoke police intervention resulting in the removal of protesters by violent means.\n\nRegrettably, acts of violence resulted when some universities called in the police. At UCLA, rubber bullets were fired by police from their shotguns at the protesters; at Columbia, a person was pushed down the stairs and police discharged a firearm when it was inexplicably used as a flashlight. Over 2,000 people have been arrested, some pushed face down to the ground.\n\nAlthough some schools resorted to police intervention, other schools did not call the police. Instead, they sat down with the protesters and negotiated demands, evidencing that the protests over this serious matter were heard and important. Hopkins appears to be a school on the verge of working out these questions without police intervention.\n\nIn some cases school administrators agreed to the demands of protesters and others they did not. Some punted the ball to their trustees for a future discussion and vote. At least there was an exchange of ideas.\n\nThis editorial is controversial among our own board members and, to be clear, it does not condone unlawful behavior, although it does view the peaceful occupation of a plaza to strengthen expression and as a focal point to bring people together as something that is not so terrible, even if the university could consider it trespass in its discretion.\n\nBut it does not condemn protesting Israeli actions in Gaza even though many call those protests antisemitic. And to be quite clear, this board condemns the threat of violence, violence and hate speech regardless of its target. We do recognize the right to express a legitimate point of view and to express it in a way that will be heard. This is particularly true in the case of students and colleges where exchange of ideas is the backbone of the education process.\n\nThe protesters have a legitimate position to present to the universities. Adding to the complexity of whether the protesters' conduct is appropriate is that some schools appear to be changing the rules in midstream, based on the protesters' anti-Israel message. Indiana University changed its longstanding rule to disallow tents, an apparent symbol or expression of this protest. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has decreed that public Texas universities must change free speech policies if the speech is antisemitic. He calls for the expulsion of students who break his rules and criticize Israel.\n\nSome on this board participated in the anti-war protests of the 1970s that occupied buildings and shut down college campuses. These demonstrations were effective and may have led to the beginning of the end of the Vietnam War although those protests, too, were controversial. We recall anti-demonstration slogans like \"America, love it or leave it.\"\n\nBack then there were many peaceful demonstrations and there were deadly ones such as at Kent State University, where the National Guard fired on, and killed, peaceful protesters. Buildings were occupied and classes were disrupted. Regardless of perspective, peaceful demonstrations and the exchange of ideas between protesters and universities are a critical part of our democracy and higher education. We support the right to engage and to criticize Israel and its leaders.\n\nEditorial Advisory Board members Arthur F. Fergenson, Julie C. Janofsky, Debra G. Schubert and H.

To outside onlookers, however, protests can seem disorganized and disruptive, and it can be difficult to see the depth of the effort or their aims.\n\nTake the pro-Palestinian protests that have sprung up at campuses across the United States in recent weeks. To the students taking part they are, in the words of one protester, \"uplifting the voices of Gazans, of Palestinians facing genocide.\" But to many people outside the universities, the focus has been on confrontations and arrests.\n\nWhere does this disconnect come from? Most people don't participate in on-the-streets protests or experience any of the disruption that they cause. Rather they rely on the media to give a full picture of the protests.\n\nFor over a decade, my research has extensively explored trends in how the media shapes narratives around different kinds of demonstrations. Reporting on the campus encampments by large parts of the media fits a general pattern of protest coverage that focuses more on the drama of the disruption rather than the underlying reasons behind it - and that can leave audiences uninformed about the nuances of the protests and the movements behind them.\n\nCovering drama over demands\n\nProtests - from small silent sit-ins and mass marches to the current student-led encampments - share similar components.\n\nThey require a degree of planning, focus on a perceived injustice and seek reforms or solutions. Protests also, by their very nature, engage in varying degrees of disruptive actions that exist in confrontation with something or someone, and utilize strategies that attract the attention of news media and others.\n\nThese core elements - grievances, demands, disruption, confrontation and spectacle - are present in nearly all protests.\n\nBut to the media, some elements are more newsworthy than others, with confrontation and spectacle often topping the list. As a result, these elements tend to be covered more often than others.\n\nIn research focusing on social movements like Black Lives Matter, the 2017 Women's March and others, I have found that time\n\nand again, coverage tends to headline the parts of the protest that are sensational and disruptive.\n\nAnd this neglects the political substance of the protests. The grievances, demands and agendas are often left in the shadows. For example, analysis of the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd conducted by myself and colleague Rachel Mour\u00e3o found the Associated Press and cable news headlines were more likely to focus on disruption and chaos than police violence or protester demands.\n\nThis pattern is referred to as the protest paradigm. While there are many factors that can make this paradigm fluctuate, like the timing of stories and the location of a news organization, movements that seek to disrupt the status quo are the most likely to receive initial coverage that frames protesters as criminal, irrelevant, trivial or illegitimate components of the political system.\n\nWhen the media takes notice\n\nThis pattern can be seen in the initial coverage of protests against the war in Gaza at U.S.-based universities. These protests began in 2023 and only escalated into the campus encampments seen today after months of campaigning.\n\nIn the months leading up to the encampments, many students who were engaged in advocacy efforts over the Israeli campaign in Gaza demanded, among other things, that their universities divest from businesses connected to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nStudents at Brown University participated in a hunger strike in February. Also in February, a coalition of students across several historically Black colleges crafted a joint call to action across university systems. Students at my university - Michigan State - rallied support through an online petition and then lobbied at board of trustee meetings. When the board of trustees issued a statement refusing divestment of any kind, students continued to march to the steps of the main administration building where they continued to protest, all before planning the encampment protests.\n\nLittle of this made it into mainstream news reports compared to late April, when an uptick in coverage corresponded with students organizing encampments at universities and university official began to respond. Those universities that asked police to enforce the dispersion of protesters amplified the intensity of confrontation, and, in turn, amplified the news coverage.\n\nAnd rather than focusing on the grievance of protesters -- that is, concerns about the deaths, injuries and looming famine affecting Palestinians -- in reports of the campus encampments it has been the confrontations between protesters and police that have become central to the news media coverage.\n\nAs with all trends, there are always deviations and outliers. Not all reported pieces align with the protest paradigm. In the research examining news coverage after the murder of George Floyd, we found that when reports in major news outlets deviate from the protest paradigm, it was often in work produced by journalists who have engaged deeply and frequently with a community.\n\nIn the current campus protests, it is student journalism that has emerged as an outlier in this respect. Take, for example, an article from the Indiana Daily Student published during the peak of the unrest, which explains the lesser-known last-minute administrative policy changes that ultimately disrupted protest planning logic and contributed to the arrests and temporary bans of faculty and student protesters.\n\nWho gets quoted, who doesn't\n\nThere are commercial reasons why some newsrooms focus on the spectacle and confrontation - the old journalism adage of \"if it bleeds, it leads\" still prevails in many newsroom decisions. For the initial weeks of the campus protests, this penchant for sensationalism has shown up in the focus on chaos, clashes and arrests.\n\nBut it is a decision that delegitimizes protest aims.\n\nThis delegitimization is aided by the sourcing routines journalists often fall back on to tell stories quickly and without legal consequence. In breaking news situations, journalists tend to gravitate toward - and directly quote - sources that hold status, like government and university officials. This is because reporters may already have an established relationship with such officials, who often have dedicated media relations teams. And in the case of campus protests, in particular, reporters have faced difficulty connecting with protest participants directly.\n\nAs a result, official narratives may dominate news coverage. So when officials like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott equate protesters to criminals with antisemitic intentions, that typically gets covered - certainly more than any rebuttal from protest participants.\n\nAnd because readers and viewers are unlikely to be on the ground to gauge Abbott's characterizations of protesters for themselves, the coverage can shape how a protest movement and the politics around it are understood.\n\nThe media shapes the way most people understand them. But as coverage of the protests across universities has shown, often the focus is on the spectacle rather than the substance.\n\nDanielle K.

The following day, Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, Columbia's president, called in the New York Police Department to sweep the \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" leading to more than a hundred student arrests and helping to propel a proliferation of the protest's tactics and demands to campuses nationwide. At Columbia, the protests expanded in the face of the police response; even so, many colleges turned to similar approaches in cracking down on their own encampments.\n\nAcross the country, some 2,800 protesters have been arrested, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. Last week I watched as officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and the California Highway Patrol overwhelmed the encampment at my own campus, the University of California at Los Angeles, with a barrage of flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets into the wee hours of night. A day earlier, the police had stood by as counterprotesters attacked the demonstrators.\n\nThe American Association of University Professors has denounced the militarized response to student dissent: \"At this critical moment,\" the organization writes, \"too many cowardly university leaders are responding to largely peaceful, outdoor protests by inviting law enforcement in riot gear to campus and condoning violent arrests. These administrators are failing in their duty to their institutions, their faculty, their students, and their central obligation to our democratic society.\" In an interview for The Review, I spoke with Irene Mulvey, president of the AAUP. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou've named a \"crisis of repression\" plaguing U.S. higher education. What is that crisis, and where did it come from?\n\nWe've seen heavily militarized police called in almost immediately to break up what began as largely peaceful protests in outdoor areas. These are on college campuses where our goal is debate, free and open inquiry. What we've seen is immediate silencing of speech, without any genuine attempt to talk to the students and understand the concerns that led to the protests, to think about and hear their demands. I've spent my entire career on college campuses, and this silencing of speech feels like a crisis of repression.\n\nWhy now? Is there something particular about the content of the protests? Or do you think that it's more about changing university conditions generally, or about changing politics off campus?\n\nThese protests, like most protest movements before them, criticize policies of the U.S. government. In a democracy, criticizing government policies is a constitutionally protected right. It follows from principles of academic freedom that that right extends to campuses, whether public or private. As with protests in the past, there are people with power and influence who would silence this criticism if they could. It's that pressure that university presidents are responding to when they're inviting what is, in my view, a disproportionate police response. They are responding to external pressure from people who would shut down this speech if they could. We're not talking about free speech in the abstract -- we're talking about free speech on college campuses, where our goal should be education.\n\nHow do you draw the line between protecting the right to free speech and protest while maintaining student safety? That's really important. There has been genuine antisemitism at some protests, and it's horrific and completely unacceptable. Colleges and universities have policies in place to deal with that, and they should deal with that. But the way to balance safety and protest, on a college campus, is through education. We need to model, teach, and promote civil discourse, respectful dialogue. To be training students in civic engagement and respectful discourse even when we disagree, to understand other people's points of view, to understand why your words might hurt someone else. The goal on a college campus should be education and understanding each other even when we disagree. If you're suppressing speech in the name of safety, you're doing the wrong thing.\n\nYou've said that repressive policing of speech and of academic freedom poses an \"existential threat to democracy.\" What relationship do you see between academic freedom on campus and democracy more generally?\n\nHigher education in a democracy serves the public good, in the sense that we produce knowledge through free and open inquiry. Nobody gets to tell us what we're allowed to study and what we're not allowed to study. We produce knowledge, we teach, we train the next generation. Higher ed is also there to call out government corruption, to call out corporate corruption, to be there to assist people drafting public policy with all our expertise. So when outsiders -- like politicians, trustees, donors, alumni -- try to shape higher education to their own agenda instead of simply serving the public good, that's a danger, because they undermine the independence and institutional autonomy that colleges and universities need to play their essential role as pillars of democracy. The militarized law-enforcement response is of a piece with that threat. It silences speech because someone powerful doesn't like it.\n\nHow closely related is this erosion of the ability of universities to govern themselves to a more general erosion of faculty power on campus?\n\nWhat keeps higher education strong as a pillar of democracy is the shared governance that we at the AAUP are promoting since we were founded in 1915. That means that the faculty, because of their expertise, make the decisions on curriculum, research, hiring, tenure, promotion, and anything involving the educational mission. The administrators have their roles over which they have primary responsibility. The trustees have their roles. But the faculty have a primary responsibility for educational matters. That's an essential role for the faculty to play, and that's what keeps the university strong and independent. And that role has been undermined because faculty have lost academic freedom. Anti-tenure laws, the explosion of contingent faculty who have no protection for academic freedom -- it's already been undermined to a large extent. But it's the faculty's role that enables the university to play its role in our democracy. So if the faculty lose their power, then the whole thing is going to fall down like a house of cards.\n\nAnother three university leaders are being called by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to testify to Congress later this month about campus antisemitism. You've written that administrators should \"not tolerate\" these hearings: What does that mean to you?\n\nThat's a tough one. It would be nice to see somebody call out these hearings for the performative political theater that they are. It's ridiculous to call them hearings because nobody's listening. None of the Republicans are listening. They're just using this as an opportunity to get sound bites and viral clips. It would be nice to see someone call that out for what it is.\n\nThe three presidents that have testified thus far have been presidents of private universities. This is unprecedented, for the federal government to feel that they have a right to dictate what's happening on private university campuses. The job of any college president testifying before Congress in this moment, in my view, is to give a full-throated and robust defense of academic freedom and free-speech rights for students, and freedom-of-assembly rights for students, and free press for student journalists. That's what they should be doing in front of this committee. If it costs them their job, so be it. If the cost of keeping your job is doing what the president of Columbia did, then it's not worth it.\n\nDo you feel like you've seen administrators or faculty on any particular campus navigating this moment especially well?\n\nWhat they did at Wesleyan, where President Michael Roth sent out an email explaining that the encampment did technically violate rules but he was going to let it stay as long as they were peaceful and didn't disturb -- that was remarkable. Some other schools have reached agreements with the student protesters: Northwestern, Evergreen State College, Brown, and Rutgers. That's the way to move forward. These kids pay tuition to attend these schools. They live on campus. So in a sense it's like they're on their own front lawn, with their tents and their signs.\n\nI think the way to move forward on a college campus, where the goal is education, is to take the student protesters seriously, listen to their concerns, understand their demands, and sit down and talk with them. Which, by the way, is a remarkable educational opportunity for the students to learn how to negotiate, to learn how to listen to what the other side has to say, to learn how to compromise, to learn how to reach an agreement, to learn that not all your demands are going to be met.\n\nWhat is this moment like for AAUP? What have you been doing in support of your chapters on campuses across the nation?\n\nWe have an email account where any faculty members who've been sanctioned or disciplined for their speech can email us with details, and we help. The silver lining here is we're organizing faculty like never before. In the past, faculty haven't been too keen on organizing. That's changing. We're seeing organizing around faculty who see how serious the threats to academic freedom are and realize that the only way to fight back is collectively, in solidarity.", "source": {"uri":

These students, faculty and other supporters oppose the bombings in Gaza by the Israeli military and want their institutions to divest from businesses supporting the war.\n\nWe have experienced these kinds of widespread protests before, most notably during the fight for civil rights, during the protracted struggle to end the Vietnam War and, more recently, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd. We should have learned something from those protests. Now, the very fabric of our colleges and universities -- one of our strongest bulwarks of democracy -- is being threatened. Rather than mass-arresting protesters and militarizing our campuses, we need to take a different approach. In particular, college presidents need to step up.\n\nMore than 2,000 protesters on dozens of campuses have been arrested since mid-April. These numbers grow daily and include public flagship institutions such as Arizona State University, the University of Georgia, the University of Texas and the University of Wisconsin. They also encompass elite private institutions including Columbia University, Dartmouth College and Emory University, my alma mater, where a video of a female economics professor being body-slammed to the ground by police went viral.\n\nMy perspective on what is happening today is informed by having been a student protester, a college faculty member who lost a summer teaching contract because of my support for student protests, and a college president who had the responsibility to run a campus in an orderly manner and keep students and everyone else safe. I can't image a scenario that would have caused me to view my students, who were mission-driven to question institutions and their activities, as trespassers or hoodlums.\n\nCollege presidents aren't the only ones who form skewed viewpoints of students who exercise their right to dissent, a principle they are taught to cherish in the academy. Public officials and other community leaders often look unfavorably on them as well. In 1978 at the college where I taught, I witnessed state troopers aggressively arresting and removing student protesters at a graduation ceremony being held at the church of an esteemed pastor and close confidante of Martin Luther King Jr. Although the pastor later criticized the use of force, at the time he refused to intercede to stop the beatings and arrests of protesters who were peacefully assembled and demanding, as required by a federal court ruling, an end to segregation of the state's colleges and universities.\n\nAfter living through this history, I am saddened because today I observe too many college presidents lacking the skill sets essential to leading their institutions through a crisis like the current one. That shouldn't be surprising: In recruiting campus presidents, the boards of trustees and top administrators of systems of higher education have placed too much emphasis on candidates with backgrounds in fundraising and marketing and those who hold degrees from Ivy League schools. Those hiring bodies often overlook two important leadership qualities: problem solving and political acumen.\n\nIn times like these, colleges need presidents who will run into fires and not away from them. And while it is true that education leaders can't stop the war in Gaza, they can stop the wars on their campuses if they communicate and engage effectively with students and uphold the sacred principle of academic freedom. This includes the right of students to question and criticize their institutions' values as reflected in how they invest their endowment and pension funds.\n\nHiding behind heavily armed police officers in riot gear is the antithesis of effective communication and leadership. A department chair at Emory, where the economics professor was body-slammed, lamented to me about the way her president and vice president watched from a window in the college's administration building while students and faculty members were being roughed up by police. \"Just the mere presence of the president on the scene would have had a calming effect,\" she observed.\n\nOne of my daughters, who teaches public school in Manhattan, witnessed fights breaking out on college campuses near her school between Jewish and Palestinian students calling each other terrorists and Zionists. She believes that the presence of senior administrators, led by campuses' presidents, might have helped defuse some of the anger.\n\nFor college presidents, protecting academic freedom entails speaking in a manner that says to society that the academy is and always will be a marketplace of ideas and an unapologetic refuge for speech no matter how unpopular some of it may be. Martin Luther King Jr. once called riots \"the language of the unheard.\" While college presidents cannot condone riots, it is equally true that unless there exists an environment of openness, where students can be heard, they will find ways to express their ideas, and some of those ways may not be constructive.\n\nI asked my daughter why she visited so many campuses where protests were occurring. She said her students were demanding to know what was really going on. \"I want to be able to tell them from firsthand knowledge what I am seeing, feeling and what might be their destinies once they graduate from high school and step onto the hallowed grounds of their chosen universities,\" she replied. To heal the divisions at our colleges today, their presidents must lead the way by leaving the comfort and protection of their offices and walking on those hallowed grounds among those brokenhearted, frightened, grieving -- and yes, angry -- students and other college family members.\n\nGoverning's opinion columns reflect the views of their authors and not necessarily those of Governing's editors

The rationales have varied from breaking the rules on \"time, place and manner\" to charges of violence and harassment to invocations of chaos and lawlessness. Columbia President Minouche Shafik even called her own students a clear and present danger to the university. President Biden decided to get in the mix last week paying a pro forma tribute to free speech and protest before -- in what can only be a strategic decision -- choosing to blame students entirely for violence and campus closures.\n\nIn many cases, it is police not students, who have been responsible for the escalation of tensions. Officers have roughed up students and faculty on multiple campuses across the country, including throwing faculty members to the ground, most notably in Atlanta, where they assaulted Emory economics professor Caroline Fohlin, and in New York, where they deployed flash-bang grenades at Columbia. And the cancellation of graduation ceremonies isn't something students can be blamed for: It is university administrators who have made these decisions.\n\nIt didn't have to be this way. Several universities are finding a path through the current moment without bringing in what Columbia historian Adam Tooze has called \" the state as blunt force.\" At Brown, Wesleyan, and elsewhere, university officials have exercised restraint and have been able to avoid the escalation we have seen on other campuses around the nation.\n\nAt Yale, where I teach, President Peter Salovey has called in the cops twice already to clear encampments, with police picking off small groups of protesters since then and sending them to the local jail. Over 300 faculty have sent a letter of protest to him and other university leadership but to no avail. President Salovey says he had no choice but to call in the police, but Yale's own history shows presidents before him allowing protests far larger and longer lasting to remain on campus without calling in the cops.\n\nIf all of this weren't distressing enough, it is becoming clear now that all that has happened over the past few weeks is a dress rehearsal. Should Donald Trump regain the White House, we now have a template for how to shut down protests without bringing in the National Guard as Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson have called for. Just get university presidents to do your dirty work. As my Yale colleague Jason Stanley, the philosopher and scholar of 20th-century fascism, has noted, the first thing authoritarians do is bring the universities to heel, either by force or by acquiescence, as these institutions are hotbeds of dissent, as we have seen over the past few weeks. When conservatives say \"roll over,\" it seems like college presidents are ready to do it again and again, lest they go the way of Harvard President Claudine Gay and Penn's Liz Magill.\n\nLet me be clear: I don't think these protests on college campuses now are perfect. But as New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen has noted, they may not be perfect, but just because they're not perfect doesn't mean they're not right. The image of the protests as sites of violence, lawlessness, and chaos is not something I or my colleagues at Yale have experienced. We've heard the same from colleagues elsewhere too. Critiques of this kind of characterization of the protests are now starting to mount from religious and secular writers. Democrats should be wary. Joe Biden probably just wants to get rid of these student protesters as a matter of political expediency -- he likely thinks he can't afford to be outflanked on law and order by the GOP on this and doesn't want these protesters to distract from his campaign this summer, but this is shortsighted and dangerous.\n\nIf Biden loses in November, it is the students and the young whom we will have to rely on to help confront what happens next. It is exactly this kind of energy, creativeness, and persistence that we will need to fight back against rising authoritarianism. But the response to these protests now from their elders is disgraceful.

Campus protests in solidarity with Gaza have erupted across North America, spanning at least 45 U.S. states, Canada and Mexico. Similar demonstrations have surged across Europe, including in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Additionally, expressions of moral outrage and solidarity have erupted in Central and South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica and Cuba, as well as in Asia (including India, Indonesia and Japan), the Middle East (including Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon and Yemen), Africa (including South Africa and Tunisia), Australia, New Zealand, and beyond. Many faculty have protested alongside their students, and on May 8 a group of professors at The New School in New York City erected the U.S.'s first faculty encampment in solidarity with Gaza, signaling the growing momentum of the movement.\n\nMeanwhile \"Hands Off Rafah\" rallies have drawn thousands into the streets, while a global day of mass protest is being planned for May 11.\n\nNo longer ripped from history, decontextualized, banished from public discourse and relegated to the sphere of silent questions and neglected connections, the horrors Palestinians have faced and are facing are writ large in all their brutality.\n\nMeanwhile, politics, collective agency and mass student resistance are being reimagined as supposedly democratic societies across the globe have embraced fascist responses to mass resistance. In the midst of the current protest movement, the historical, political, economic and cultural framing mechanisms that connect the current repression on campuses and the struggle for Palestinian rights have become more visible. What has also become more visible is the long history of the politics of disposability, a rising culture of violence against those considered other, and the transformation of higher education into an adjunct of corporate power.\n\nWhat must be extremely threatening to the far right and corporate media alike is that student protesters and their allies are clear about the connections between the issues of academic freedom, police violence, colonialism and human rights that they are raising -- they are refusing to let these issues be separated in a fragmented, isolated, ahistorical and induvial fashion. In the manner of German Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin, the student protests are blasting \"open the continuum of history,\" rethinking it with fire.\n\nWhile the issues of academic freedom, Palestinian rights, and the scourge of militarism and war are crucial issues for the students, they are not disconnected from the blight of neoliberalism and racialized state violence as fundamental elements of oppression. Hence, what the protests signify in the broader sense are new insights, new framing mechanisms, and a critical interrogation of history in order to avoid the protests and their call for a radical democracy from being spectacularized, depoliticized and torn from the history.\n\nWith the outbreak of Israel's war on Gaza, students are courageously protesting the indiscriminate and massive killing of women, children and civilians by the Israeli government -- with more than 35,000 killed thus far. The student protests have called for a permanent ceasefire, recognition of a secure state for the Palestinian people and for universities to disinvest from industries that produce weapons of war, particularly for Israel. The protests have struck a nerve and awakened the need for rethinking the role of higher education in a time of tyranny and war.\n\nUniversity administrators, liberal and far fight politicians, the corporate media and right-wing billionaires have responded by disingenuously condemning the protests as \"antisemitic,\" claiming that the protests are the work of \"outside agitators,\" and those in charge have supressed student resistance with militarized force.\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be part of the usual self-righteous, smug and repressive strategy of diversion and blame. But there are deeper forces at work in the ideological and militarized responses by most of the universities where the campus protests are taking place. University presidents under pressure from powerful far right politicians and billionaires are increasingly relying upon the police to deal with acts of civil disobedience by student protesters who have set up campus tents in opposition to \"the U.S.-backed Israeli military offensive in Gaza.\" As of May 5, 2024, over 2,400 people have been arrested by police. Students as well as faculty have been assaulted by the police, zip-tied, hauled into buses and criminally charged for standing up for their beliefs.\n\nAs Tim Dickinson points out in Rolling Stone, it is alarming to see \"rooftop snipers and militarized police subduing protesters.\" He further notes:\n\nThe behavior of law enforcement has -- once again -- shined a stark spotlight on police brutality and disregard for First Amendment rights protecting freedom of assembly, speech, and the press. As cops have gone ham on protesters, and engaged in dubious mass-arrests, they've also roughed up journalists and even smashed college professors to the ground.\n\nThis type of indiscriminate violence against peacefully protesting students and faculty echoes what one would expect in outright fascist regimes. Historian Rick Perlstein astutely observes that military-like responses to campus protests today would have been unimaginable in the 1960s. He highlights some of the most egregious abuses against faculty members, underscoring their significance. In a piece for The American Prospect he writes:\n\nAt the University of Wisconsin, a balding, bespectacled professor face down, two cops pinning his left arm sharply behind his back, and a disabled professor getting her dress torn and suffering internal damage from police strangulation. The 65-year-old former head of Dartmouth's Jewish studies program who dared scream \"What are you doing?\" at cops being taken down with a wrestling move that also left her with an arm wrenched behind her back. Then a second cop arriving to keep her pinned as a third looks on blithely, rifle at the ready. (She was suspended by her university for her trouble.) At Washington University in St. Louis, a 65-year-old professor, a Quaker, was told by his doctor he was \"lucky to be alive\" after absorbing a flying tackle from a very large officer for the sin of filming cops with his cellphone, then being dragged to a nearby patch of grass, writhing, then to a police van, where he fell limp.\n\nMuch of the response is an attempt to punish students for addressing what one might call one of the crucial moral and political issues of our time: freedom for Palestinians to determine their own political fate. At the same time, the repression signals to students that when free speech begins to hold power accountable, there are severe consequences, extending from suspensions, expulsions, loss of future job opportunities and even to potential arrest.\n\nIn this case, it becomes clear that the basic values often attributed to higher education as a social good -- extending from teaching students how to be critical, informed, socially responsible, compassionate and engaged citizens -- are viewed with disdain and subordinated to the repressive values and notions of learning aligned with the corporate university. These include viewing the world through normalized template of market values, embracing a cutthroat notion of competitiveness, defining the worth of a degree through commercial interests, disdaining any mode of learning not tied to future financial gain and disregarding connections between knowledge from larger social issues. This is a pedagogy of capitalist cloning buttressed by the threat of state terrorism.\n\nIn light of the student protests and the repressive response, the university's reactionary neoliberal values and the pedagogical practices that enforce them have revealed the hollowness of the university's claim to free speech and academic freedom, on the one hand. The protests also underscore the extent to which higher education has been corporatized and militarized. It is important not to forget, as the South African Nobel Prize winner in literature, JM Coetzee points out, that powerful corporate elites have little regard for higher education as a critical institution and public good, and \"reconceive of themselves as managers of national economies who want to turn universities into training schools equipping young people with the skills required by a modern economy.\"\n\nMoreover, this attack on higher education is not only ideological but also, as we see with the campus protests, relies on the repressive militaristic institutions of the punishing state. What is often missed in progressive analyses of the protest movements is the interconnection between the corporatization of higher education and the current efforts to militarize it through outright suppression by the police and other forces of state repression.\n\nThere is a long history of increasing neoliberal influence on higher education, its alliance with the military-industrial complex, and its willingness to accept huge amounts of financial support from corporations serving defense industries. In fact, as I noted in 2007 when I published The University in Chains-Confronting the Military-Industrial-Academic Complex, former President Dwight Eisenhower's famous critique of the military-industrial complex originally included the term \"military-industrial-academic complex\" -- the latter term he was persuaded to drop before his Farewell Address to the Nation on January 17, 1961.\n\nSince Eisenhower's speech, especially in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, the U.S. has become increasingly militarized and policed. On the domestic front, police violence has escalated dramatically, especially with the relentless killing of Black and Brown people, the most notorious and public examples including the murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. At the same time, higher education has increasingly aligned itself with the national security state, becoming a site of commerce, research for the Pentagon and a training ground for staffing innumerable intelligence agencies.\n\nSince the 1970s, a form of predatory neoliberal capitalism has waged war on the welfare state, public sphere and the common good. The new mode of governance argues that the market should govern the economy and all aspects of society. It concentrates wealth in the hands of a financial elite and elevates untrammeled self-interest, unchecked individualism, deregulation and privatization as the governing principles of society. Under neoliberalism, everything is for sale, and the only obligation of citizenship is consumerism. We live in an age when economic activity is divorced from social costs, while policies that produce racial cleansing, militarism and staggering levels of inequality have become the organizing features of everyday life.\n\nLargely defined as a workstation for training global workers and increasingly in need of funding, higher education -- as John Armitage writes in Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies -- easily assumed the role of a \"hypermodern militarized knowledge factory.\" As public schools increasingly model themselves after prisons, becoming shooting galleries due to the prevalence of guns and military weapons in the U.S., higher education has further boosted its unholy alliance with the defense and intelligence industries, which largely served dominant state, military and corporate interests.\n\nUnder an austerity-driven neoliberal project, education has defaulted on its willingness to cultivate critical citizens essential for a democratic public sphere. In a broader perspective, education is increasingly seen as a target for suppression, not only by the far right but also by both political parties. Their aim is to reduce it to a mere appendage of the corporate and defense industries while imposing pedagogies of repression and conformity.\n\nThe current assault on higher education exemplifies how market values erode the public good and destroy any viable sense of higher education as a democratic public sphere. Operated as a business, higher education prioritizes profits over fostering an education that nurtures an informed and creative citizenry, forsakes democracy as a guiding principle, and reshapes higher education through what Wendy Brown in Public Servants: Art and the Crisis of the Common Good, describes as \"vulgar forms of marketization.\"\n\nDefunded and corporatized, many institutions of higher education have been all too willing to make the culture of business the business of education. This transformation has corrupted their mission, making them all the more susceptible to aligning themselves with anti-democratic forces of militarization. Actions by universities to stifle student protests and employ oppressive elements of the national security state must be understood against this backdrop. Viewed as guardians of the market, as vehicles to produce compliant workers for the neoliberal order, higher education institutions transform into right-wing indoctrination centers, they establish such educational institutions that play a formidable role in the ongoing militarization of U.S. society. Hence, it should come as no surprise that, in the face of campus protests, school administrators were all too willing to stifle dissent and employ the police to shut down peaceful protests.\n\nThe merging of neoliberalism, militarism and a politics of indoctrination pose a dire threat to higher education, academic freedom and democracy itself. What must not be forgotten is that the campus protests signify more than a struggle for Palestinian rights and freedom; they also represent a fight to reclaim higher education as site of democratization, a public good and a crucial civic institution where student voices can be heard, and where the dynamics of critical thinking, dialogue, informed judgment and dissent can take place without fear of repression.\n\nIt is worth remembering Martin Luther King,Jr.'s words composed in 1963 in which he stated: \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.... We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\" In the spirit of King's impassioned words, higher education offers a crucial civic space for dialogue, critique, historical memory, the affirmation of mutuality and social responsibility. It is a space where the death of those considered disposable can be made visible and challenged, where the stories of the ungrievable can be told, and politics and pedagogy become a form of moral witnessing and empowerment.\n\nThe fight for Palestinian freedom cannot be separated from the challenge of building a multiracial working-class movement struggle against neoliberal capitalism, confronting the militarization of higher education and beating back an emerging fascist politics both at home and abroad.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_a_giroux@truthout.org", "name": "Henry A.

The agreement includes a board vote this fall on students' divestment proposal and a guarantee that campus affiliates who participated in the encampment protest will not face expulsion or suspension.\n\nIn a statement, Brown President Christina Paxson said students had agreed to end their protests and clear their camp and \"refrain from further actions that would violate Brown's conduct code through the end of the academic year.\"\n\nIn turn, \"five students will be invited to meet five members of the Corporation of Brown University in May to present their arguments to divest Brown's endowment from 'companies enabling and profiting from the genocide in Gaza'.\"\n\nStudent protestors jumped for joy upon hearing the news of the deal and chanted \"With love not fear, divestment is getting near\" before beginning to remove their tents, an AFP report said.\n\n\"We are ending (the encampment), knowing that we made a huge victory for divestment at Brown, for this international movement and a victory for the people of Palestine,\" the news agency cited Brown student Leo Corzo-Clark as saying.\n\nEvergreen State College\n\nStudents and administrators at Evergreen State College, a public college in Washington, agreed to create a task force for \"socially responsible investing\" and provide transparency around investments.\n\nEvergreen is the alma mater of American peace activist Rachel Corrie, who was killed by Israeli troops in 2003 as she protested the demolition of Palestinian homes in Gaza.\n\nLast week, the school issued a memorandum of understanding, furnishing a list of committees including students, faculty, and university staff, focused on defining socially responsible investment and addressing divestment from companies that profit from human rights violations and occupation of Palestinian Territories.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nEvergreen has also issued a statement, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The school has pledged not to approve study abroad programs to Israel, Gaza, or the West Bank and to regions where students are denied entry based on their religious identity.\n\nTrinity College, Dublin\n\nThe school has pledged to divest from Israeli companies listed on a United Nations \"blacklist\" after only four days of student protests. The college plans to establish a task force to review connections with Israeli Institutions.\n\n\"Trinity will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist,\" the school said in a statement. \"Trinity will endeavor to divest from investments in other Israeli companies.\"\n\nTrinity's supplier list contains just one Israeli company, which will remain until March 2025 for contractual reasons, said the statement.\n\nUniversity of Barcelona\n\nThe university's council voted to break ties with Israeli institutions and research centers following pressure from student protests.\n\nThe vote called for the university to break all institutional and academic ties with Israel, including centers, research institutes, companies, and other institutions in the country.\n\nThe result was 59-23 in favor of the motion, with 37 abstentions.\n\n\"This is a big step forward in our fight in solidarity with the Palestinian people at universities,\" student council member Pablo Castilla was quoted as saying by the Catalan News Agency (ACN) after the result of the vote.\n\nThe approved motion will now be laid before the Board of Directors and the Governing Council of the university.\n\nOther institutions that have successfully negotiated with student protestors, demanding transparency and disinvestment from Israel, include SUNY Purchase College, University of Minnesota, Rutgers University, and New Brunswick.\n\nThe student-led protests are rooted in the BDS movement that stands for boycott, disinvestment, and sanctions. Pro-Palestinian movements have demanded BDS since 2005.\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice disband protest by pro-Palestinian activists at University of Amsterdam\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters retake MIT

I'm also one of the student workers participating in a sickout at Columbia that began on Monday.\n\nHundreds of student workers are withholding our labour to demand the New York Police Department (NYPD) is removed from our campus. We're demanding that all student protesters, including the brave students who took over Hind Hall, be granted full amnesty by the university.\n\nAt the centre of our organising is Palestine. As students and workers at elite institutions in the imperial core, we know that unless we take action, we are complicit in a brutal and ongoing genocide.\n\nIn addition, we're fighting against the repression of this movement, against the serious legal charges on students and faculty and the attacks from the right.\n\nWe're demanding that they divest their investments from all corporations and organisations that support or benefit from this genocide and apartheid. And this is a drop in the bucket of global investment and imperialism and militarism.\n\nBut we believed when these protests began on 17 April that demanding divestment from Colombia was crucial. If we could force this institution to divest, it would create a domino effect.\n\nAnd we now know that intuition is correct. This institution, which was egged on by the federal government, by the mayor of New York City, brought down brutal, violent state repression on a bunch of peaceful protesters.\n\nThey wouldn't have done this if we didn't represent a threat to the political status quo in the United States and its material support for Israel. If we weren't a threat, they wouldn't have beaten us. And to be very clear, Columbia administration and the NYPD are the number one threat to student safety on our campus. Columbia invited a notoriously deadly, violent, and racist police force onto our campus.\n\nThe police discharged a weapon in a classroom and tried to cover it up. Several of our students and union members were injured, including three who ended up in the hospital. Our comrades at universities across the United States face violent repression because together organised students and workers present a threat to imperialism everywhere -- and labour action is the next step.\n\nIt's the main thing that hasn't been present in this fight yet. Massive student protests and public outcry have gone really far and the labour movement needs to step up and join. Not just by making statements, not just by mobilising members into street protests, not just by educating members internally -- but by actually withholding our labour.\n\nNow is the time. Many of us have been on strike in the last few years. We have the networks and the relationships with our co-workers and the physical infrastructure to strike. We know how to do it.\n\nOther organised workers across the US are withholding their labour. At Columbia, we are withholding our labour for two demands, cops off campus and full amnesty for the student protesters.\n\nAt City University of New York, rank and file workers held a sick out on May Day and refused to work. This challenged a law which makes it illegal for public sector workers in New York to go on strike ever.\n\nThere is also a grading strike happening at NYU, calls for strike at the New School and really, really historically in California, United Auto Workers Local 4811, which represents student workers -- then and tens of thousands of them, has called for a strike authorisation vote this week about divestment specifically. These actions are historic.\n\nWe're taking these actions not just because Palestine is a labour issue for us personally. All workers are hurt when they're forced to work for a boss that is complicit in genocide. We stand in full solidarity of the international working class and in solidarity with the people of Palestine.\n\nI want to encourage everybody who thinks that their union would never take action for Palestine. Our organising on our campus has never seen as much interest or as many workers or think that we are right now around Palestine. And finally, really quickly, I want to emphasise the importance of organising together in assemblies like this one.\n\nThis is incredibly important, what you've built today, sharing information and tactics, discussing and debating and making decisions together as workers.\n\nIt's incredible that professors and student workers are joining the students in the encampment and everyone is putting their bodies on the line to defend each other and to fight back against the enormous amount of repression. And we put ourselves in harm's way because we cannot tolerate another day of our labour being used to fund a genocide.\n\nSara, a recent graduate from Birzeit university in the occupied West Bank\n\nBirzeit became a university in the 1970s and since then until today Israeli forces have closed the university over 15 times for periods ranging from four days to 1,571 days.\n\nStudents should not just come to university to get information and take exams, but must be socially active and immersed in the issues of the people.\n\nThe educational journey must be one of liberation from colonialism. Education must be liberated from imperial, Euro-American, white constraints. It can't be education based on individualism, selfishness and indoctrination.\n\nMy most memorable incident during my four years of university is the funeral of Jawad and Thafer. They were two brothers who were shot dead and killed by Israeli forces near Ramallah and we said their final goodbyes inside the campus.\n\nLarge number of students in Birzeit are politically active. And therefore, the annual election for the student council is not just to select a representative for academic, financial and material demands for the student but also reflecting the political opinions of the student.\n\nThere is a representation for both Palestinian right and left in universities. The student movement started to become very active during the 70s when the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) also was very active. And in the 80s the students helped in and encouraged to ignite the first intifada.\n\nHowever, after the Oslo agreement came, both the Israeli occupation forces and the Palestine Authority pushed the idea that universities are only for studying -- which I totally disagree with.\n\nWith all appreciation to all the encampments around the world, I do not believe there is a valid comparison between the demonstrations in the American and European universities and those in Palestinian universities.\n\nWhat you are doing by supporting Gaza, it's you as citizens and students in the colonising community asserting your right to express opinions. Perhaps you'll go beyond that to genuine political action, and that's great. There is no comparison for me between people from colonisers expressing their desires not to be current colonisers and those of us being colonised in Palestine.\n\nHere, confrontation against Israeli occupation and being an activist inside the campus could cost your life. It's an existential struggle and when our voices are raised there are hands with guns and fists put into our faces.\n\nI sincerely believe that the Palestinian cause is the moral compass for global issues and in the liberation of Palestine you find your own liberation. This awareness is important in the struggle inside the encampments and in our shared struggle against global imperialism.\n\nEshah is a national rep for Students for Justice in Palestine, which has been part of coordinating the wave of encampments and actions across US universities.\n\nStudents for Justice in Palestine in the last few weeks has launched the popular University of Gaza as a campaign in the wake of the current escalations happening on campuses. It is inspired in part by the traditions of the freedom schools of the black Civil Rights movement. It aims to consolidate the coordinated mass movement of students, faculty and staff.\n\nWhat we are doing is forcing our universities into a situation where they must answer the community calls for divestment. And we're cultivating a counter-space to distance ourselves from the system that the university has invested in.\n\nWhat we are doing is taking back the university. We are asserting the willingness and undeniable ability to dismantle the system itself through a critical mass of students, faculty and staff. We choose Palestinian liberation over maintaining the universities' legitimacy and despite the police brutality and the violent repression that we're seeing.\n\nThis has transcended our borders and we are seeing a global student intifada. And we carry this mantle proudly. We see divestment -- knowing that our universities are invested in these systems of oppression -- as the core demand of what we want to see out of these encampments.\n\nNow is the time to escalate, and now is the time to act. Our students are responding to that call through their encampments, through their occupations, showing both our universities and the leaders of our country that we will not be complicit in this genocide.\n\nStudents are playing the most crucial role. We know that the people of Gaza are watching and we have a responsibility to respond to that more. Furthermore, people are looking at our youth as the forefront of our struggle.\n\nStudents have reinvigorated this movement. They lead this movement and they transform society.\n\nRuby, Palestine Youth Movement, California\n\nUCLA had a very aggressive experience with the encampment. And the reason that we got that response was because of the power that the students built in UCLA and principles that they were pushing. They were exposing UCLA as an agent of the imperialist project.\n\nThere was a high Zionist presence from the very beginning. And students experienced a lot of push back from the Zionists. They used tactics like blasting music at 5am and throwing fireworks into the encampment.\n\nAnd the administration used that as justification to empty out the encampment. So what we see here is very clearly an analogy of how Zionist interests are aligned with the US imperialist interests that the administration represents.\n\nZionists were able to use violence without being stopped, against students who were rightfully there on their own campus.\n\nBut although the aggression was intense, people have endured. And although the violence was really at a high level, the spirits of the community and at UCLA are stronger than before.\n\nThey have built an understanding of the encampment as a tactic in a larger project of building power and building the movement for liberation.\n\nUCLA students have said they're willing to go through the violence a hundred times over as long as it gets them closer to divestment, as long as it gets them closer to Palestinian liberation.\n\nUCLA and the LA community have a strong political consciousness of what it means to sacrifice for Palestine and to work towards the liberation of Palestine. And we're seeing that the community here is more invigorated than ever before.\n\nFatima is the general secretary of Progressive Students Federation in Pakistan\n\nTheoretically, governing regimes in Pakistan pay lip service to Palestine due to the pressure from the public but we're more interested in building meaningful solidarity. So the people of Pakistan have proven time and time again that they will not stand by any decision to normalise ties with Israel ever.\n\nThis is among the demands of the current student protests. We're also demanding an immediate ceasefire, the removal of the ambassadors of the US, Britain Germany and France until their countries acknowledge Israel's genocide and the complete liberation of Palestine and the state endorsement of the BDS movement.\n\nStudent unions in Pakistan have been banned for 40 years now. And upon admission in educational institutions, students are made to sign affidavits banning them from any sort of activity.\n\nNevertheless, we have been organising for years for Palestine. We organised a march last year in November in which thousands of people answered the call and came to the city squares.\n\nThe Left Democratic Front, an alliance of left parties, also had a countrywide day of action for Palestine in which large demonstrations took place in dozens of cities.\n\nStudents in Lahore also heckled the German ambassador at a human rights conference and they also protested outside the US consulate. So last week we initiated a countrywide campaign on campuses and so far we've covered almost 15 campuses. And this number is expected to reach over 35 campuses by next week.\n\nFor people of the land which was colonised for two centuries by the British, we know how important it is to build solidarity with the Palestinian people.\n\nIsmael, Sciences Po, Paris\n\nWe've been campaigning a lot since October, but we decided to start in terms of escalation a few weeks ago. We face a lot of police repression. Actually, our campaign didn't survive even one night of occupation before the university called the police. And this is unprecedented in the French context.\n\nWe haven't seen these scenes since 1968, which is very important. We are exposing a double standard when it comes to talking about Palestine -- supposed free speech and the reality of repression.\n\nWe have to make sure that we as students are always focusing on Gaza. But at the same time, internally we're destroying our institutions who are now ripping themselves apart because faculty and professors are going wild.\n\nAngus, Sydney university, Australia\n\nSince 7 October we've been building a campaign. And there's been some highs such as when Tel Aviv University came onto our campus for an exchange fair and we occupied the building to kick them off.\n\nBut the encampment has been deeply needed because our university is massively complicit in Israel's genocide and students want to fight but don't know how.\n\nThe response since we started the encampment a little over two weeks ago has been massive. When the Zionists tried to shut us down, we organised a massive counter-rally.\n\nWe've stuck to the same politics we've been arguing for since 7 October and before but with a much more active and much broader audience.\n\nIt's very important that there is now a growing anti-imperialist pole in the Palestine movement. It's linked to a growing awareness of issues such as Aukus -- the alliance of Australia, the US and UK and the war on China. Students and staff don't have to accept the militarisation and wars.\n\nUniversities have huge numbers of students but they are also massive workplaces. And some of the most inspiring scenes from the US are workers taking action in defence of student rights.\n\nWe're working towards more of that in Australia. In Sydney the staff union will be voting in just a few hours to implement an academic boycott of Israeli universities.\n\nThe call also heard from activists in British universities, and from the victory at Goldsmiths university in south London.\n\nMarc from Goldsmiths university in south London\n\nWe set out to campaign against our university's moral and financial complicity in the genocide that started to take place after 7 October.\n\nWe were initially following the national call outs for walkouts and protests on campus but it was becoming evident to us as a group that it was easy to ignore us.\n\nSo we decided to issue a letter to our senior management team with key demands. These were around issuing a new statement for an immediate ceasefire and a commitment to uphold academic freedom and freedom of expression.\n\nWe demanded management protect the right for students to protest on campus. And we demanded it officially commit to rebuilding Gaza and educational infrastructure and establish links with Palestinian universities. We called for an expansion in scholarships as well as the divestment from a number of complicit investments, and removal of the IHRA definition on antisemitism.\n\nAnd it was also evident that these demands wouldn't be met without severe escalation. So following the walkouts we were doing, we decided to storm the council meeting with all of the governance bodies at the university present. And then, following again being ignored, we decided to occupy one of the main buildings on campus.\n\nThis was the Stuart Hall building. We shut this building down entirely and managed to draw the senior management team to negotiations. In these we managed to verbally get a number of commitments that addressed all of the demands that just said previously.\n\nHowever, we left that occupation without getting a published statement of commitments and a timeline for the fulfilment of these commitments. It's what we wanted so that they could be publicly held accountable. And therefore, on 1 May we managed to gain entrance to the library building on campus. We decided spontaneously to hold another occupation to demand another meeting with management\n\nThis obviously is the main building on campus at the moment with students preparing for exams and assignments. And so management were quick to respond and grant us another meeting in which they've publicly released the statement of commitments.\n\nThey are now committed to doing a new statement which condemns what's happening in Gaza. And they're committed to an expansion in scholarships, including some that are the first of their kind in Britain. And they will review protest guidelines that were introduced in response to our campaign.\n\nThey are committed to reviewing and raising the concerns that we have around the investment fund with the view to finding an alternative investment fund. So that should hopefully lead to divestment and from the complicit investments. And there is also a commitment to reviewing the definitions of antisemitism.", "source": {"uri": "socialistworker.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socialist Worker (Britain)"}, "authors": [],

Many student protesters see a parallel between White-dominated South Africa and argue apartheid has been imposed on Palestinians by Israel's occupation.\n\nThis protest movement has demonstrated that the Gaza war appears to have energised the somnolent younger generation penned up at home during covid and given students a cause. While previous protests were largely mounted by Whites, those taking part in the current movement come from all racial and ethnic communities.\n\nThey see themselves taking a principled stand on a war raging on the other side of the world. Many have followed the course of the conflict through satellite television or social media where they witnessed horrifying events in real time. They have been shocked and traumatised seeing children who have lost limbs, men digging family members from under the rubble of their homes, and women crooning over the white shrouded corpses of husbands, sons, and daughters.\n\nSome students may regard pro-Palestinian protests as a means to revolt against the stultifying stasis in Washington which is dominated by lobbies, oligarchs and the military-industrial complex. Others may regard the Gaza war as representative of a cruel range of widely disproportionate assaults taking place across the US and the world.\n\nWith little in common in their backgrounds, US youths now share the experience of solidarity against the Gaza war. Solidarity is powerful and gripping, particularly when aimed at The Politico-Economic Establishment which cares nothing about the interests of current and future generations on existential issues like race, climate change and the environment.\n\nProtests can also be enlightening. During the occupation of campuses there are teach-ins by students who know something of the history of the 75-year-old Palestinian-Israeli/Arab-Israeli conflict. Many of those involved will be better informed, take further interest in world affairs, and judge US politicians on what they do about Gaza and other crucial foreign and domestic policy issues.\n\nGaza war activists will be marked for life like those, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who remains proud to have protested the Vietnam war. For many, those protests were their first political expression. Some of Sanders' generation have pursued an enlightened career in politics.\n\nPresident Joe Biden neither fought in Vietnam nor chose to protest that war. When asked in 1987 why he took this decision, he replied with a flippant remark, \"I wore sports coats. You're looking at a middle-class guy. I am who I am. I'm not big on flak jackets and tie-dyed shirts and -- you know, that's not me.\"\n\nWhile dismissing the defining dissident movement of his generation, he appears to be dismissing the protests which could deny him re-election if enough 18, 10, and 20-year-olds decide not to vote for him in the predicted match-up with Donald Trump. Trump has called for the National Guard to use force to break up protests with force.\n\nSome university administrators have waited-out the protests, listened to the students and promised to consider their demands, preventing confrontation. Others have suspended or expelled students and called in armed cops in helmets and flak jackets so they look like Israeli troops invading Gaza. Administrators who have taken the second option have deepened the existing generational divide afflicting the US.\n\nA YouGov poll released on May 4 showed that 53 per cent of adults felt that college administrators who took a tough stand were \"about right\" or \"not harsh enough.\" That number reached 68 per cent for respondents of 65 and above.\n\nToday there are over 15 million undergraduate students in the US. White students comprise 41 per cent, Latino students 18 per cent, Black students 11 per cent and Asian students 6 per cent, the rest were of mixed race, indigenous, and Pacific islanders. Women outnumber men by 58 to 42 per cent.\n\nIt is interesting to note that whites are 61 per cent of the US population of 335 million, Latinos 18.5 per cent, Blacks 12.2 per cent, and Asians 5.6 per cent. While Whites are underrepresented on college campuses, Latinos, Blacks and Asians account for almost the same percentages as in the population as a whole.\n\nSignificantly, more than half of Whites belonging to the 20 per cent of Whites who did not go to university are Trump's core voters. Some are associated with supremacist White organisations and favour harsh treatment of protesting students. The latest polls show Trump, with a 46 per cent approval rating , is leading Biden, with 44 per cent, in the presidential election race. Students protesting Biden's backing for Israel's Gaza war will have to chose between two bad options in November.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"},

That's the prediction of the admissions director at the New College of Florida, Bruce Abramson, whose Sarasota campus has seen little political protest since Governor DeSantis overhauled the school's \"woke indoctrination\" last year.\n\nColumbia University has been splattered across the news because of the drama surrounding the pro-Palestinian tent encampment that surfaced on its main lawn last month. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce is launching a robust investigation into Columbia, Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania over the growing antisemitism on their campuses in the wake of the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. Some schools, though, have been free of such scrutiny.\n\n\"On any campus, there has to be a rule of law,\" the president of New College, Richard Corcoran, who previously served as the speaker of the Florida house, tells the Sun. \"You can't have a just functioning college without that.\" There is a constitutional right to due process, he says, yet some student protesters have exceeded the protections of free speech and broken the law.\n\n\"The difference among these schools is leadership,\" Mr. Abramson says. \"What you need is leadership that is prepared to stand up and say, 'This is wrong. This is antisemitism.'\" Attorney Jay Edelson, who represents a Jewish student suing Columbia over its alleged failure to offer sufficient protections from harassment, tells the Sun that while Columbia has been in crisis, \"other schools -- like the University of Florida, that haven't equivocated -- are fully functional.\"\n\nAfter an encampment surfaced at the University of Florida, its president, Senator Sasse, said in a statement that the school \"is not a daycare, and we do not treat protesters like children -- they knew the rules, they broke the rules, and they'll face the consequences.\" Mr. DeSantis warned students they could be expelled for engaging in unsanctioned protests.\n\nUnlike Columbia, which has canceled its main graduation ceremony, at America's largest public university, Arizona State University, 24 successful commencement-related ceremonies took place this week without interruption from student demonstrators. \"You might note that we are holding our graduation and we protect free speech at the same time,\" ASU's president, Michael Crow, told a stadium full of 6,000 graduates and 30,000 spectators on Monday. \"Welcome to Arizona State University.\"\n\nThe university has warned that bringing in flyers, banners, and flags \"will result in removal and Student Code of Conduct consequences -- even for graduates.\" When a pro-Palestine protest surfaced on campus two weeks ago, Mr. Crow called in the ASU police and the state police, later touting that \"there were no weapons that were used ... it came out about as well as could be expected given the complication of the nature of the demonstration.\"\n\nAn exodus from California state schools, which have been seeing clashes between student demonstrators and police, could benefit universities in the southwest like ASU, along with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of Arizona.\n\nHigh school applicants preferring private universities could create a bump in admissions at southern schools like Vanderbilt, Emory, and Duke, where violent protests have been scaled down swiftly. Each of those schools saw more competitive admissions cycles this year.\n\nVanderbilt saw a historically low overall admission rate of 5.1 percent this cycle, contributing to a steady decline in the past few years. Repercussions for student protesters have been among the most severe there, leading to the exclusion of three students from the Nashville campus. \"If you're forcing your way into a closed building, you're engaging in vandalism,\" the school's chancellor, Daniel Diermeier, told NPR. \"That's not an expression of free speech.\"\n\nDuke, meanwhile, has stayed clear of national attention because its on-campus demonstrations have been mostly calm. The Durham campus saw its acceptance rate drop to a record-low 4.1 percent this year as it received its highest-ever number of applicants. Another southern school, the University of North Carolina, received more than 67,800 applications for first-year students, an increase of 15 percent from last year.\n\n\"Since UNC's enrollment deadline is May 15, it is too early to comment on the number of accepted students for fall 2024 who enroll and how that compares with previous years,\" the school's office of media relations tells the Sun. \"Any effect of the protests on future admissions would only be speculation at this point.\"\n\nIf recent history is any guide, UNC, the no. 4 public school in the country, has seen an increase of 22 percent in the number of transfer applications this year, meaning that 5,150 college students sought to switch to its campus.\n\nHarvard College, on the other hand, saw an overall 5 percent decline in the number of applications this year, down to 54,008 from 56,937 last year. Its overall acceptance rate was 3.59 percent, the least competitive in four years. That drop follows an outcry over surging campus antisemitism that culminated in the resignation of Harvard's president in January.\n\nEnrollment trends could reflect broader migratory patterns, as growing numbers of Americans move toward the south and the southwest. \"It's easier to send a high school kid to a new state than it is to uproot your family,\" Mr. Abramson says. The trends also suggest a growing resentment toward the politics of prestigious Northeast campuses.\n\nSince New College abandoned its office of diversity, equity, and inclusion, it has seen an almost 300 percent increase in the enrollment of Black students -- to 39 students from 10 -- while Hispanic enrollment has nearly doubled, to 93 students from 47. That's according to demographic data, shared with the Sun by Mr. Abramson that compares the fall of 2022 and the fall of 2023.\n\nSwinging away from an overwhelming liberal student body, New College broke its record for the largest incoming class last year and is on pace to grow its enrollment to between 1,200 and 1,500 students from just less than 700 students today. Mr. Corcoran expects the student body to become more diverse this year as the school picks up more out-of-state students, internationals, and athletes.\n\n\"Through all the changes that have been made and by getting rid of the DEI office, we're getting a real diversity and we're getting real inclusion of all walks of life and we've eliminated the indoctrination,\" Mr. Corcoran says.\n\nSome have derided the reforms as pushing toward conservative thought, though Mr. Corcoran insists they are reviving fairness: \"You are not affording students a good education if you're one side or the other -- I don't care if it's hard right or hard left.\"\n\nMr. Corcoran estimates that 10 faculty members have since left for \"ideological reasons.\" Yet the school brought in new faculty to offset those departures and is set to announce in the coming weeks 40 new hires for the fall.\n\nOther schools that abandon DEI could soon see similar trends. On Sunday, MIT became the first elite American university to announce it will no longer require aspiring faculty members to include \"diversity statements\" as part of their job applications. Admissions trends may also be affected by the recently reinstated SAT and ACT requirements at Yale, Harvard, Brown, Dartmouth, and MIT, a reversal of test-optional policies.\n\nYet the prestige of elite campuses, no matter how chaotic they may get, is enduring. \"The brand needs are valuable and it will take a long time for them to erode,\" Mr. Abramson notes. \"And the alumni networks are valuable.\" When it comes to corporate hiring, though, some employers are expanding their recruiting efforts beyond the Ivy League.\n\n\"This is all part of the reform move to reform higher ed,\" he says, \"emphasizing education over indoctrination. Educated students will debate, indoctrinated students will destroy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_j_koch@nysun.com", "name": "M.J.

A former second-round pick, he spent last season on the practice squad, hoping to earn a spot in 2024. They did not waive him injured, so this appears to be a case of simply moving on.\n\nThose who held out hopes that the Steelers would suddenly unlock Denzel Mims' potential can begin the grieving process now. They officially released him yesterday, creating an opening on the 90-man roster. We will have to see what they do with it, but barring a trade, I doubt it's another wide receiver.\n\nThe Steelers have a pretty wide-open competition at wide receiver behind George Pickens. One would think that a player with any sort of talent could push his way into that mix. Evidently, however, they did not feel that Mims was up to the task. Not that they will tell us exactly why they waived him, especially given the down time.\n\nA former second-round pick of the New York Jets, Denzel Mims has played 988 snaps since 2020. He never saw the field last season, spending the year on the Steelers' practice squad. Or most of it, anyway, after they signed him in October.\n\nAt 6-3, 207 pounds, Mims is an impressive physical specimen. He ran a sub-4-4 40-yard dash and looked to be the next great thing coming out of Baylor. Now is he looking for his fourth NFL team, having never played a snap for two of his previous teams.\n\nThe Jets traded Mims to the Detroit Lions in July of last year for a conditional late-round pick swap. They waived him with an injury designation in mid-August, the Steelers signing him a month and a half later to the practice squad.\n\nThey got several months' worth of looks at Mims while he was on the practice squad, deciding to re-sign him. After going through OTAs and minicamp, however, they waived him without an injury designation. How many more chances will teams give him before he has to move on to his life's work?\n\nAs the season progresses, Steelers players' stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year, with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications, particularly when players lose their jobs, or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions, whether minor or major.\n\nA bad game, a new contract, an injury, a promotion -- any number of things affect a player's value. Think of it as a stock on the market, based on speculation. You'll feel better about a player after a good game, or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor, while others are likely to be quite drastic, so bear in mind the degree. I'll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.\n\nRelated Items:Denzel Mims Recommended for you What Are Steelers Going To Do With Open Roster Spot?

Mims, a former second-round selection for the Jets, signed with the Steelers in October, joining the practice squad. He signed a future/reserve contract in January to remain with the team through the offseason, but it appears he could be on the move to a new destination.\n\nLast offseason, the New York Jets traded Mims to the Detroit Lions, receiving a pick swap of a 2025 conditional sixth-round pick and a seventh-rounder. However, the Lions waived the former Baylor receiver in an injury settlement prior to the season, rendering the trade null. Because the Lions cut Mims, the team didn't need to send compensation back to the Jets, as the original trade was conditional on him making the final roster.\n\nThe Jets originally selected Mims with the No. 59 overall pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In his first three seasons, he played in 30 games total. His most productive season was as a rookie in 2020. The former Bears standout had 23 catches for 357 yards. Those numbers went down to eight catches and 133 yards, and 11 catches for 186 yards over the next two seasons. Mims has yet to record a touchdown since entering the league.\n\nThe former Baylor Bears standout initially signed a four-year deal worth $5.43 million in 2020. The Jets would have owed him $1.35 million for the 2023 season, before trading him.\n\nMims turns 27 this season, which will be his fifth in the league. With his release from the Steelers, he's free to sign with a new team at any point.\n\nEarlier this month, the Steelers reunited with former third-round draft pick Cam Sutton, signing the cornerback to a new deal for the 2024 season. Sutton was released from the Detroit Lions in March after he was wanted for aggravated battery-domestic violence. Since his release, the former Tennessee standout has entered a pretrial diversion program to help reduce his charge to a misdemeanor.\n\nSutton spent the 2023 season with the Lions after inking a new deal in free agency.

We'll see how the team fills the open roster spot, likely with a free agent (perhaps a punter; they could use one of them to round out the roster), but it's a back-end of the roster getting cut in June. It isn't the first time, and it won't be the last.\n\nBut it's worth taking a moment to talk about receivers like Mims. The guys out of college who look the part. Tall, can run, jump, and go up and get the football. The players who look like NBA forwards. Mims was that type. Coming out of Baylor, he measured in at 6027, 207 pounds, ran a 4.38, and jumped 38.5 inches. What's not to like?\n\nI'll be the first to admit I was high on Mims' game. He felt like the league's next stud receiver. Just throw it up and let him make a play.\n\nThat's the rub. The NFL doesn't work that way. In college, especially in more wide-open systems like Baylor, players like Mims can win. But the NFL doesn't allow players to get by with just physical tools alone. Above all else, receivers have to do two things.\n\n1. Get open\n\n2. Catch the ball\n\nMaybe Denzel Mims could do the second part. But he struggled to do the first. Vertically, Mims was a threat. But he lacked the full route tree to consistently separate and make himself open for his quarterback. That's why he struggled to gain traction with the New York Jets. Mims was a second round pick who caught just 42 passes across three seasons, and presumably why he didn't last in Pittsburgh. It didn't help that his college WR Coach, Frisman Jackson, was replaced this offseason, giving Mims one less guy in his corner to fight for his 90-man roster spot.\n\nObviously, this is not a critique of the Steelers picking up Mims. They didn't draft him. They signed him to their practice squad and invested very little in him. He's just a vessel to the broader draft philosophy.\n\nDenzel Mims is far from the only case study. Last year, the Steelers brought in Hakeem Butler for a look. They didn't draft him, but Butler's career struggles follow the same arc. Big guy who has speed but can't sink his hips and cut to get open (he also struggled to catch the ball cleanly). It's why Butler can dominate spring leagues but struggle when the NFL comes calling. He's football's equivalent of a baseball AAAA player - caught between being too good for the minor leagues but not good enough for the majors.\n\nOther high picks shared the struggle. Former first-rounders Laquon Treadwell and N'Keal Harry busted in Minnesota and New England for precisely that reason. And it's why some college standouts fall in the draft. Florida State's Johnny Wilson looked the part and dominated in college, averaging nearly 20 yards per catch over his last two seasons, but fell for a lack of a position and route-running ability.\n\nPerhaps it's why Pittsburgh has had a good track record with receivers. Generally, they've stayed away from taking that mold of player. They've won by drafting the prospects knocked for their size: Antonio Brown, Santonio Holmes, Emmanuel Sanders because they were impressive route runners who could get open. The best receiver is an open one.\n\nThey've had their exceptions. George Pickens felt like that mold of player coming out of Georgia. But his route running has improved, and his vertical ability is so elite that it mitigates the rawness in his game. When Pittsburgh missed, it often was because they drafted a basketball player like Sammie Coates or Limas Sweed. I'm talking a bit broadly here, but that's one point (of many) to consider why the Steelers have been so darn successful.\n\nIt's a lot of words on an offseason roster release, I know. But Denzel Mims' release got me thinking about the position, the big picture. And one of the personal draft lessons I've learned over the years. Be careful falling in love with those good-looking big receivers. They'll burn you.\n\nRelated Items:Denzel Mims, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Ed O'Neill Shares First Impression Of L.C.

Mims most recently played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and was waived Wednesday.\n\nThe Jaguars made the move official on Thursday, waiving receiver Kendric McGowan as a result.\n\nSelected with the 59th-overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Mims hasn't been able to catch on in three years. In 30 games with the Jets, Mims caught 42 passes for 676 yards. Last July, he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for a 2025 conditional sixth-round pick. The Lions waived/injured Mims before the season began.\n\nIn October last year, Mims signed with the Steelers practice squad before signing a reserve/futures contract with the team in January.\n\nMims is the older brother of Marvin Mims Jr. of the Denver Broncos.\n\nTraining camp info: When will the Jaguars report for 2024 training camp? Veteran, rookie report dates revealed\n\nThe Jaguars enter this season with a full arsenal of receivers after drafting Brian Thomas Jr. in the first round of this year's draft and signing receiver Gabe Davis via free agency in March. Jacksonville also signed former Ravens receiver/return specialist Devin Duvernay in March.\n\nJacksonville recently made changes on the backend of the roster at the receiver position.

Mims was many things -- a provider, a devoted husband, and a loving father. Standing 6 feet 7 inches tall, he was known as a \"gentle giant\" and the anchor of his family, who is now grappling with his violent death outside a Saginaw store on Father's Day.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken,\" said Mims' widow, Lexi Mims, sitting beside their 2-year-old son, Ny'Kayel. \"That was my best friend, my kids' father. He held his family together. When it came to kids, he didn't miss a beat.\"\n\nLexi Mims is now seven-months pregnant with Mims' seventh child, a son named Ny'Quan who will never get the chance to meet his father. Another son of Mims, Da'Quan L. Mims Jr., died in 2015.\n\n\"He was a great father,\" she said. \"He did everything for my kids. He did everything for me.\"\n\nShe met Mims when she was 14, initially thinking he was significantly older due to his size.\n\n\"I was scared of him because he was real big,\" she laughed. She soon learned he was actually a few months younger than her.\n\nThe couple had an on-again, off-again relationship for years before tying the knot in 2021. Among Mims' qualities that won her over was his ear-to-ear smile.\n\n\"His smile was everything,\" she said. \"If he smiled, you were gonna smile.\"\n\n\"Or he was gonna say something to make you laugh,\" added Lexi's mother, Hulie Strong. \"He was just amazing.\"\n\nMims worked in construction and most recently for a local forklift operating company. In his spare time, he enjoyed fishing and gambling at the Soaring Eagles Casino in Mount Pleasant. He also had three dogs and thought of himself as something of a \"dog whisperer.\"\n\nMore than anything, though, he cherished spending time with his children.\n\n\"They ask for their daddy every day,\" she said of how they're processing his death.\n\nMims suffered fatal gunshot wounds around 1:45 a.m. on Sunday, June 16, while in the 100 block of North Hamilton Street. Police have said a large crowd was gathered in front of West Side Party Store when the shots rang out. Two officers working overtime were already dispersing another crowd a block south.\n\nLexi Mims said she heard her husband had been planning to head home when he stepped inside the party store. He was shot as he emerged from the business, she said.\n\nMims' father, Wesley Willis, said he's frustrated and angry over his eldest son's death. As a minister at Shiloh Baptist Church in Carrollton Township, his profession has called on him to meet with grieving loved ones of homicide victims.\n\n\"I've prayed with other parents who have lost their child, but I never thought I would be living this,\" Willis said. \"It seems like a nightmare.\"\n\nWillis described his son as an excellent young man who overcame trials and tribulations of his youth. Mims has 12 siblings and was particularly close to his sisters.\n\n\"His relationship with my daughters...they loved him more than they loved me,\" Willis said with a slight chuckle.\n\nGoing forward, Willis said he will be solid presence in his grandchildren's lives.\n\n\"I think if [Da'Quan] had chance to say any last words to me, he'd say, 'Take care of my kids, Pop.'\"\n\nPolice have made no arrests in Mims' homicide, the 11th of the year in Saginaw.\n\nAnother shooting occurred about 8 a.m. on June 15 near T&M Market at the intersection of Genesee and Webber streets on the city's East Side. That shooting claimed the life of 30-year-old Johnell S. Whittington.\n\nThose with information specific to Mims' death are urged to call Saginaw Police Detective Martin Blank at 989-759-1231, while tipsters on either homicide can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-422-5245.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, though they'll be handled by Evans & Browne's Funeral Home.\n\nWillis said his biggest concern is city officials taking steps to curb gun violence plaguing Saginaw. While police were already on overtime patrols on Hamilton Street when the shooting occurred, more are needed to prevent future shootings.\n\n\"When will they really do something, put something in place, to do something about it?\" he asked. \"We need police in these neighborhoods.\"\n\nRegarding the large-scale street parties that have been backdrops for the shootings, Willis said there is a difference in the teens and young adults attending them now compared to those of past generations.\n\n\"I was young at one point,\" he mused. \"The difference between then and now is they're using guns for fun. We didn't use guns for fun. We had fun.\"\n\nAs Mims' family eagerly awaits news of an arrest, Lexi Mims is taking solace in her memories of her husband.\n\n\"Every day was the perfect day with him,\" she said. \"He could just be sitting there and I'd just be so in love. He was beautiful person. I just keep seeing his smile.\"", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis", "type":

Former #Jets second-round pick had been with Pittsburgh since last October on the practice squad.\n\nThe former Baylor product originally entered the league as the No. 59 overall pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft.\n\nGang Green earned a ton of national praise for stealing Mims on day two of the draft when some folks projected him as a first-round draft choice that year.\n\n\"Obviously it was a very deep draft for receivers and from all the predictions, we thought Denzel would go late in the first round or maybe early in the second. So it was a real shock that he went late in the second round, but boy, what a coup for the Jets to get him that late,\" John Werner of The Waco Tribune-Herald explained via the Jets. \"I think he will have a chip on his shoulder. He's a guy who likes challenges and I would expect him to have a pretty good rookie year.\"\n\nDespite the hype, Mims never lived up to the billing.\n\nHe played his first three seasons with the Jets from 2020-22. During that run, Mims caught 42 receptions for 676 receiving yards and never scored a touchdown.\n\nHeading into his fourth season, the Jets hit the eject button and attached a conditional seventh-rounder in 2025 to the Detroit Lions in exchange for a conditional 2025 sixth-rounder.\n\nMims didn't make the roster and was released in August of 2023. A few months later he inked a deal with the Steelers to join their practice squad. However, he is once again looking for work.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the green and white haven't had much success this century with wide receivers in the second round.\n\nIn 2021 the Jets selected Elijah Moore with the No. 34 overall pick in the second round. He was another player that people thought could've gone in the first round but he slipped through the cracks.\n\nMoore appeared to be living up to the hype during the offseason and in spurts during the season, but issues arose. He complained about his involvement in the offense, there were issues with the coaching staff, and ultimately like Mims, he was jettisoned off via trade.\n\nIn 2015 the Jets selected Devin Smith out of Ohio State with the No. 37 overall pick. There were sky-high expectations that Smith could be another star from the Buckeyes, but he flopped with the Jets and bounced around the league for years.\n\nFinally, in 2012, when this Jets second-round curse started, the team traded up to select Stephen Hill out of Georgia Tech with the No. 43 overall pick. Hill's size (6-foot-5, 209 pounds) and speed (4.36 40-yard dash) wowed the Jets.\n\nSadly it was a classic case of more style than substance. Hill only lasted two years with the Jets and never appeared in a regular season game for any other NFL team after that.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Mims", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Mims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baylor Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_Tribune-Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waco Tribune-Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Smith_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Smith (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hill_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Hill (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1437756675-e1718736555468.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He didn't appear in any games for the Steelers, and has not participated in an NFL game since 2022 with the Jets.\n\nMims was taken in the second round back in 2020 out of Baylor, where he earned first-team All-Big 12 honors in his final college season.

However, Mims was waived with an injury designation in August.\n\nHe then signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers practice squad last year but failed to show up in a regular season game. Mims hasn't seen the field since 2022.\n\nComing out of college, many NFL Draft analysts hoped that Mims would have a successful career in the NFL. From 2017 to 2019 playing for Baylor, Mims caught 182 passes for 2,901 yards and 28 touchdowns.\n\nHis collegiate performances were enough to get drafted by the Jets with the 59th overall pick in the 2020 draft.\n\nUnfortunately for the Jets, it didn't work out, which stings even more considering the other notable receivers in that draft such as Justin Jefferson, CeeDee Lamb, and Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nThe Jaguars will attempt to revive Mims' career in hopes of seeing a glimpse of his Baylor days. This move comes after the Jaguars have already overhauled their wide receiver room.\n\nThe Jaguars added Buffalo Bill speedster Gabe Davis along with Devin Duvernay and drafted LSU star wideout Brian Thomas Jr. with the 23rd overall pick.\n\nAll of these new pieces will play alongside Christian Kirk, who's racked up nearly 1,900 yards in two seasons with the Jaguars.\n\nRelated: NFL Player Tries to Recruit LeBron James to His Team\n\nRelated: Jahmyr Gibbs Outrageous Instagram Live Video Going Viral", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thad_brown@postandcourier.com", "name": "Thad Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Mims", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Mims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baylor Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahmyr_Gibbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahmyr Gibbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Duvernay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Duvernay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kirk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Kirk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/f8/6f823ebf-0808-533c-b001-785e39dac6e5/66743f51671c3.image.jpg?crop=1113%2C584%2C0%2C107&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Jacksonville will be Mims' fourth stop in the league since entering in 2020 with the New York Jets.\n\nThe former second-round selection for the Jets signed with the Steelers in October, joining the practice squad. He signed a future/reserve contract in January to remain with the team through the offseason, but he is now on to his next opportunity.\n\nLast offseason, the New York Jets traded Mims to the Detroit Lions, receiving a pick swap of a 2025 conditional sixth-round pick and a seventh-rounder. However, the Lions waived the former Baylor receiver in an injury settlement prior to the season, rendering the trade null. Because the Lions cut Mims, the team didn't need to send compensation back to the Jets, as the original trade was conditional on him making the final roster.\n\nThe Jets originally selected Mims with the No. 59 overall pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In his first three seasons, he played in 30 games total. His most productive season was as a rookie in 2020. The former Bears standout had 23 catches for 357 yards. Those numbers went down to eight catches and 133 yards, and 11 catches for 186 yards over the next two seasons. Mims has yet to record a touchdown since entering the league.\n\nMims initially signed a four-year deal worth $5.43 million in 2020. The Jets would have owed him $1.35 million for the 2023 season, before trading him. He turns 27 this season, which will be his fifth in the league.\n\nWhile in Waco with the Bears, Mims was an All-Big 12 first-team honoree in 2019. He started all 13 games as a senior, racking up 66 receptions for 1,020 yards and 12 touchdowns. He also surpassed 1,000 receiving yards as a sophomore, tallying 61 receptions for 1,087 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nThe NFL 2024 calendar year began at 4 p.m. ET on March 13. At that time, contracts running through 2023 officially ran out, making those players free agents. Prior to the beginning of free agency, teams had a chance to designate one franchise or transition tag player, starting on Feb. 20 at 4 p.m. ET and ending on March 5. Beginning March 11 through March 13 teams could enter into a legal negotiation with players who will become unrestricted free agents.\n\nIn addition to NFL free agency, the new year also marked the beginning of all trades being made official by the league office. April 19 marked the deadline to sign restricted free agents to offer sheets. On April 24, the deadline for teams to match restricted free agent offers sheets hit.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baylor Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Mims", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Mims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waco, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waco, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/08/18094718/denzel-mims.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-11", "dateEnd": "-03-13", "textStart": 2258, "textEnd": 2283}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-13", "textStart": 1972, "textEnd": 1980}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 2204, "textEnd": 2211}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-05", "textStart": 2239, "textEnd": 2246}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-19", "textStart": 2510, "textEnd": 2518}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2590, "textEnd": 2598}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The news comes as the Steelers continue to be linked to receivers this offseason. San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk has been mentioned as a logical player for the Steelers to trade for.\n\nThe Steelers' trials at wide receiver this spring have been well-documented. After trading Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers this offseason, the Steelers are still looking for a No. 2 WR to play alongside George Pickens. The Steelers receiver corps looked poor at OTAs.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have been heavily linked to Brandon Aiyuk\n\nFeb 11, 2024; Paradise, Nevada, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk (11) against the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAs previously discussed on GH, the Steelers are considered a top destination for Aiyuk:\n\nOne of these situations that appears to only be getting messier is that between All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk and the San Francisco 49ers. Should the two sides be unable to reach an agreement, the 49ers may be willing to trade the disgruntled pass catcher. If they do, Cory Benjamin of CBS believes the Steelers could be a top destination:\n\n\"Repeatedly linked to Aiyuk via both report and rumor, the Steelers jettisoned Diontae Johnson earlier this offseason, and while Roman Wilson arrived in the draft, they could still use a veteran complement to George Pickens as Russell Wilson and Justin Fields square off for quarterback duties. Aiyuk's downfield dynamism could be a perfect fit for their otherwise rugged offense.\"\n\nDaniel Jeremiah with the NFL Network also named Aiyuk as a trade match for the Steelers.\n\nIf Brandon Aiyuk is truly available via trade (don't know) I could make a strong argument Pittsburgh would be a perfect match.\n\n-- Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) June 17, 2024\n\nThe Steelers opened up their roster for a shakeup at wide receiver.\n\nThe Steelers are waiving Denzel Mims\n\nDetroit Lions wide receiver Denzel Mims practices during training camp at the Detroit Lions Headquarters and Training Facility in Allen Park on Sunday, July 23, 2023.\n\nAccording to Mike Garafolo with the NFL Network, the Steelers are waiving Denzel Mims:\n\nThe #Steelers are waiving WR Denzel Mims, source says. Former #Jets second-round pick had been with Pittsburgh since last October on the practice squad.\n\nMims had been one of several players battling for the No. 2 WR spot. He didn't show enough this spring to have a shot to make the roster in training camp. The Steelers appear unsatisfied with their depth at receiver following OTAs.\n\nMims has appeared in 30 NFL games and started in 15. He's recorded 42 receptions for 676 yards. The Steelers can use Mim's open roster spot on another wide receiver.

The move opens up a roster spot, and people are wondering how the Steelers intend to fill it. The more adventurous and hopeful suggest that it is the prelude to a trade -- for example for a starting wide receiver. Perhaps not Brandon Aiyuk in particular, but somebody who shores up the weakest starting spot.\n\nThis is not the most common time for teams to release players, though it does happen. Last year, for example, the Steelers released Scott Nelson around the same time without a corresponding move. They did not waive Mims with an injury designation, which is also notable.\n\nPerhaps they simply felt they saw enough during OTAs and minicamp to make their evaluation on him. One thing the Steelers have is volume at the wide receiver position, so they can be discriminating here. Mims is the sort of player who looks good in shorts, as well, so that's another indicator of his performance.\n\nPerhaps we wake up today to find out that the Steelers have signed another punter. After all, their new punter, Cameron Johnston, is on the older side, so they'll want to give his leg rest. But fans always love to speculate about an open roster spot, and, well, the Steelers have that opening in the starting lineup at wide receiver.\n\nAnd it's not like they haven't given fans ammunition. Shortly before the draft, the Steelers restructured Alex Highsmith's contract. While the move itself was normal, the timing was not. And we later learned of reports suggesting they nearly worked out a trade for a wide receiver. Now they have both the cap space and the roster spot to make something happen.\n\nBut don't get your hopes up, at least not yet. Many analysts do believe they will trade for a starting wide receiver at some point, but it doesn't have to be right now. The Steelers may have just felt it was time to move on from Denzel Mims. Occam's Razor: sometimes the simplest explanation is the most likely.\n\nThe Steelers' 2023 season has been put out of its misery, ending as so many have before in recent years: a disappointing, blowout playoff loss. The only change-up lately is when they miss the playoffs altogether. But with the Buffalo Bills stamping them out in the Wildcard Round, they have another long offseason ahead.\n\nThe biggest question hanging over the team is the quarterback question. Does Russell Wilson make them a Super Bowl-caliber team, or are they wasting a year? Will he play just one season in Pittsburgh before moving on, or the Steelers moving on from him? How will the team address the depth chart?\n\nThe Steelers are past free agency and the draft and their roster for the 2024 season is coming into focus. They made numerous moves through signings and trade -- and release. More than usual, they seemed comfortable creating holes, confident they can fill them. Now that we have so many pieces of the puzzle, however, we merely have a new set of questions to ask.\n\nRelated Items:Denzel Mims, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Eckert's Examinations: DL Dean Lowry Run Defense Study Analyst Claims Steelers Signed Russell Wilson Because They Were In 'Crisis Mode' At Quarterback Denzel Mims Proves Cautionary Tale Of The Power Forward Receiver", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mims_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mims (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punter_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punter (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Mims", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Mims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Johnston_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Johnston (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blowout (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Tomlin-Khan-Post-Draft-Presser-Stock-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

However, he'll now have an opportunity to compete for playing time in Jacksonville's offense while catching passes from a top quarterback in Trevor Lawrence.\n\nAt just 26 years old, this could be the move that Mims needs to revitalize his career.\n\nThings weren't always this tough with Mims.\n\nPrior to his NFL career, Mims was a 4-star high school recruit in the state of Texas. He had offers from multiple schools, but decided to stay in his home state to play for Baylor.\n\nThe move paid off for Mims, who had an outstanding final three seasons for the Bears. He finished his college career with 2,925 receiving yards and 28 touchdowns, eclipsing 1,000 yards twice. He earned First-Team All-Big 12 honors as a senior with over 1,000 yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nAt 6'3'' and 207 pounds, Mims drew plenty of attention in the pre-draft process with his size and college production. The Jets took a chance on him with a second-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.\n\nUnfortunately, Mims couldn't replicate his college production in New York. He never eclipsed 360 yards in a season, and has been unable to register a single touchdown in his three years in the league.\n\nMims requested a trade after a disappointing start to his career. The Jets eventually conceded, trading him to the Detroit Lions in exchange for late-round draft picks. He didn't make it a month in Detroit before the team cut ties with him.\n\nNow, after being released again by Pittsburgh, Mims could be on one of his last chances to make an impact in the NFL. If he can't find his footing with the Jaguars, then his next opportunity might come with a league like the UFL instead.\n\nThings look quite different for the Jets at receiver than they did a year ago.\n\nGarrett Wilson returns and remains the team's clear No. 1 option. The former Offensive Rookie of the Year brings a top-tier skill set to the position, but the Jets wanted to add weapons to take some of the pressure off of him in 2024.\n\nMike Williams was brought in to serve as another veteran option on the outside. Meanwhile, general manager Joe Douglas added another weapon in the slot in Malachi Corley, a rookie out of Western Kentucky. The tape on him shows a player capable of being a dynamic playmaker after the catch, which could open up New York's playbook.\n\nThe arrivals of Corley and Williams could push other players down the depth chart. Allen Lazard has been disappointing since arriving last offseason, but could find some value in a more rotational role for the team.\n\nThese receivers, along with a revamped offensive line, should help things go differently for Aaron Rodgers in his second season with the Jets.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_brooke@heavy.com",

There's more fallout from the Brandon Aiyuk drama in San Francisco. A former Steelers receiver is looking for work. A predictable target for Jake Guentzel's free-agent services has come to light.\n\nAnd the Oilers are still alive in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nDone with Denzel\n\nThe Steelers have released wide receiver Denzel Mims from the 90-man roster. That's according to Mike Garafolo of the NFL Network.\n\nMims initially came to Pittsburgh as a practice squad member after the Detroit Lions cut him following training camp last summer. He entered the league in 2020 as a second-round pick from the New York Jets out of Baylor.\n\nGiven the news of Brandon Aiyuk's frayed relationship with the San Francisco 49ers, many are connecting the dots between Mims' release and the Steelers perhaps preparing to acquire Aiyuk in a trade.\n\nSure. That would be great. But releasing Mims is relatively inconsequential to the equation. There are a lot more dominoes to fall before an acquisition of that magnitude should transpire -- much greater than just releasing Mims.\n\nNot only would the Steelers need to figure out salary compensation for Aiyuk (he has already allegedly turned down $26 million), but they'd also need to come up with sufficient trade chips for the 49ers.\n\nHey, trust me, I'm not against the Steelers trying to make an Aiyuk trade happen. I've been completely on board with that for a long time.\n\nI'm just saying that releasing Mims now isn't necessarily the precursor some are making it out to be. This is adding 1-plus-1 and getting 16. The Steelers might just know that Mims was the least likely of the group of receivers they planned to keep from that big group they brought into minicamp, and they are just letting him go now before carrying him on to training camp.\n\nIf the Steelers don't acquire anyone else of consequence to replace Mims, they still have Calvin Austin III, Roman Wilson, Quez Watkins, Van Jefferson, Marquez Callaway, Scotty Miller and Dez Fitzpatrick fighting for roster spots to complement George Pickens.\n\nReality check\n\nAs we theorized in Monday's \"First Call,\" a noted national media voice is also saying that Aiyuk was being melodramatic when he claimed that the 49ers \"don't want\" him in San Francisco anymore.\n\nAiyuk made those statements during a social media video posted Monday. But ESPN's Adam Schefter says that's not the case.\n\n\"I can tell you that Brandon Aiyuk is not accurate in that statement. The 49ers absolutely want him back. The problem is at what price do they want him back,\" Schefter said on 97.1 The Fan in Columbus on Tuesday. \"The wide receiver market has exploded. It's gone up dramatically. The offers and deals have been higher -- I believe -- than what the 49ers have offered Brandon Aiyuk. So Brandon Aiyuk is taking what the 49ers have offered, and he's saying, 'The fact that they don't want to pay me like Justin Jefferson, they don't want me here.' No, that's not true. They do want him there, but they want him there at a certain number that they believe is fair.\"\n\nYeah. Exactly. That's what we were saying Monday and have been saying for months.\n\nNow, the question for Mike Tomlin and Omar Khan is, \"How badly do they want Aiyuk in Pittsburgh?\" You might think that a price tag in excess of $26 million per year and a second-round pick may be too much.\n\nI don't.\n\nNot with the cap space the Steelers have now. Not with the fact that they don't have a QB on the roster for next year. Not with the knowledge that they are unlikely to pay a big ticket on a QB next year, either.\n\nThey are spending $162 million on defense via OverTheCap.com. That's by far the most in the NFL. The Steelers are only spending $80.9 million on offense, the second-lowest total in the NFL.\n\nThe Steelers have $15.8 million in cap space, with the ability to create more. It's time to start spending on offense too.\n\nAiyuk is currently slated to make $14.1 on the fifth-year option of his entry-level contract.\n\n* 'His legacy is going to live on': Pirates' Andrew McCutchen reflects on death of Willie Mays\n\n* Steelers A to Z: After a year at WVU, Beanie Bishop looking for home as slot corner\n\n* Ticket from Roberto Clemente 3,000th-hit game, Ben Roethlisberger milestone jersey up for auction\n\nOn the same topic\n\nWhile we are talking about the wide receiver position, a former Steelers pass catcher has been released by the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe franchise announced the release of Mathew Sexton on Tuesday.\n\nThat move corresponded with the organization's decision to sign veteran defensive lineman Calais Campbell.\n\nSexton was signed by the Steelers in 2021. An Eastern Michigan product, Sexton flirted with making the club as a punt returner and slot target. But he was released in late August.\n\nSince then, Sexton has bounced around to the Chiefs, Falcons, Patriots and Dolphins. He was also with the XFL's Vegas Vipers for a stint in 2023.\n\nThis should come as no surprise\n\nThere has always been a belief that the Vancouver Canucks may want to make a play for former Penguin Jake Guentzel in free agency. Now a report from the \"Daily Faceoff\" is fanning those flames.\n\nVia Frank Seravalli at that website, \"When the clock strikes 12 noon ET on Canada Day, expect the Vancouver Canucks to make a strong play for pending free agent forward Jake Guentzel. ... Sources have been percolating that the Canucks might present the best mix of money and opportunity right out of the gate.\"\n\nNot only might Vancouver be able to pay Guentzel what he wants on a team that won the Pacific Division last year, but he'll have a ton of familiarity around him.\n\nFormer Penguins executives Jim Rutherford (president of hockey operations) and Patrick Allvin (general manager) are running the Canucks front office, and Rick Tocchet is the head coach. They were all part of the Penguins' Stanley Cup team in 2017 when Guentzel won a ring as a rookie.\n\nEx-Pens teammates Teddy Blueger, Sam Lafferty, Ian Cole and Casey DeSmith are also on the team.\n\nAFP Analytics is projecting Guentzel to get a seven-year, $9.3 million deal. He has 491 points in 520 regular-season games. In 69 playoff games, Guentzel has 38 goals and 67 points in 69 postseason games.\n\nE-Rod's road\n\nThe Stanley Cup Final is still going on. That's because the Edmonton Oilers forced a sixth game by virtue of a 5-3 win in Game 5 at Florida on Tuesday.\n\nEdmonton's Connor McDavid put the game on ice with one of the more memorable empty net goal situations you'll ever see.\n\nThe Oilers led the game 3-0 and 4-1. But the Panthers wouldn't let the game die. Former Penguin Evan Rodrigues had a goal and an assist.\n\nRodrigues now has seven goals and 15 points in the playoffs.\n\nEdmonton once trailed this series 3-0. But they have won the last two contests to force a return trip back to Canada for a sixth game.\n\nThe last team to win the Stanley Cup Final after getting down 3-0 was the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1942. They came back to beat the Detroit Red Wings.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_benz@triblive.com", "name": "Tim Benz", "type":

Initially drafted by New York at No. 59 overall four years ago, Mims has since struggled to earn his way onto an NFL field.\n\nThe 25-year-old Mims, who has not seen regular season game action since 2022, has only 42 receptions to his credit over 30 career appearances. The disgruntled pass-catcher fell out of favor in New York under head coach Robert Saleh's administration and he proceeded to cause a locker room disturbance by requesting a trade prior to, and during, the 2022 season.\n\nLast summer, the Jets finally granted the underperforming Mims his wish. New York dealt the underachiever and his attitude to the Detroit Lions while also exchanging 2025 late-round draft picks.\n\nOne month after arriving in Detroit, Mims was waived/injured by the Lions. The Steelers subsequently signed him to their Practice Squad last October. Mims signed a futures contract with Pittsburgh this past winter, but the team cut bait following its June minicamp.\n\nEarlier this offseason, the Kansas City Chiefs released Jets' 2020 fourth-round running back La'Mical Perine, who later signed with the Steelers. Perine last played for the Jets in 2021 and did not appear in a game during the 2022 campaign. He made three regular season appearances for the Super Bowl champion Chiefs in 2023.\n\nWith first-round offensive tackle Mekhi Becton and fifth-round cornerback Bryce Hall both signing elsewhere this offseason, the Jets have only one remaining player from their nine-member 2020 draft class. Third-round safety Ashtyn Davis is the lone draftee to earn a second contract from New York.\n\nThree of the picks, two of which never played a game, are no longer active in the NFL -- third-round DE Jabari Zuniga, fourth-round QB James Morgan, fourth-round OT Cameron Clark.\n\nFurther amplifying the massive failure that is the Jets' 2020 draft, all nine of the team's picks came in the Top 200. Four years later, none of the nine are likely to be NFL starters, except maybe punter Braden Mann.\n\nNew York's final selection at No. 191 overall, Mann struggled in three seasons with the Green & White. The Jets waived Mann in April 2023 and replaced him with veteran Thomas Morstead. The Philadelphia Eagles added Mann two weeks into the regular season.\n\nThe staggering lack of production from his first draft as Jets' general manager has Joe Douglas on the perceived \"hot seat\"

He logged 19 tackles, 1 interception and a pass breakup over six games.\n\nThompson had an uphill battle to making the final roster, having brought in plenty of competition this offseason.

The announcement is accompanied by the already-reported waiving of WR Denzel Mims, freeing up two roster spots.\n\nThompson was signed mid-way through the 2023 training camp when Pittsburgh was hit by injuries at safety. He impressed during the summer and earned his way to a practice squad spot, displaying ball skills and hit power with a solid frame. Our post-camp write-up was cautiously optimistic.\n\n\"He can be overaggressive and reckless, which puts him out of position. Thompson had a tendency to miss tackles and take poor angles. But he's a hair-on-fire player with playmaking skills too, picking off a pass in the preseason from Robber coverage and showed an overall knack for playing the football in the air. He's someone who caught Mike Tomlin's eye and should stick on the practice squad.\"\n\nAs injuries to Steelers' safeties piled up during the season, Thompson was lifted from the practice squad. He appeared in six games for Pittsburgh, making one start, recording 22 tackles. He also picked off one pass, a key interception in the team's first game versus the Cincinnati Bengals that turned the tide in the Steelers' favor.\n\nThompson suffered a neck injury against the Indianapolis Colts and did not play the rest of the season. It's unclear if lasting impacts of the injury led to his release today.\n\nMims spent the 2023 season on the team's practice squad. A former second round pick of the New York Jets, he'll look to catch on elsewhere.\n\nPittsburgh's roster now sits at 89 players. Before these two moves, the Steelers carried 91 players due to rookie OLB Julius Welschof's International Exemption. He does not count against the roster.\n\nRelated Items:Denzel Mims, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending, Trenton Thompson Recommended for you Russell Wilson-Justin Fields NFL's Top 'Battle' In Training Camp, PFF Believes Herm Edwards Outlines Steelers' Path To Win AFC North Steelers' RB Room Ranked 17th In NFL By Pro Football Focus", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trenton Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herm_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herm Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trenton-Thompson-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

While several more transactions are obviously on the way as the Steelers proceed through training camp, the organization's history tells us that a few players are still likely to be added who will ultimately be a part of the team's Week 1 53-man roster.\n\nAccording to my research, and dating back to 2012, the Steelers have added 36 players to their offseason roster who weren't with the team once its annual mandatory minicamp ended who ended up on the team's Week 1 53-man roster that same year. That's an average of three players per year. On top of that, there was only one year, 2019, that no players added to the offseason roster after mandatory minicamp ended, or would have ended, wound up on the Week 1 53-man roster.\n\nJust last season, the Steelers added ILB Kwon Alexander and CB Desmond King II to their offseason roster well after training camp got underway. Both players went on to make the Week 1 53-man roster.\n\nIn 2022, the Steelers added four players to their roster after mandatory minicamp with two of them, OL Jesse Davis and OLB Malik Reed, coming via trades right before the regular season started. All four players, one of which was DT Larry Ogunjobi, wound up on the Week 1 53-man roster that season.\n\nIf you're hoping for a trade acquisition by the Steelers between now and the start of Week 1 of the 2024 regular season, I have good news to pass along. Of the 36 aforementioned players added post-mandatory minicamps dating back to 2012, 11 of them came via trades. That's an average of almost one per season.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Steelers announced they have parted ways with WR Denzel Mims and S Trenton Thompson and that results in the roster now including 89 players. With two open roster spots, we can count on the Steelers filling those soon. Will those additions come in the form of UFL players? It's possible, but even so, more offseason roster shuffling is sure to occur, especially once training camp gets underway in July.\n\nAs far as possible significant additions go for the Steelers moving forward, one can only hope that an experienced wide receiver might be on that list at some point. For most of this offseason, and especially since the 2024 NFL Draft ended, there has been a ton of speculation that the Steelers should and will trade for an experienced wide receiver before the regular season starts.\n\nThe Steelers' cap situation as it sits in the middle of June would allow for a significant trade acquisition at the wide receiver position. Even so, there have been no hard signs that such a trade for a wide receiver is imminent. Additionally, it's worth reminding everyone that significant NFL trades don't usually occur in the month of June. In the meantime, just keep your fingers crossed.\n\nWith us now being in the deadest portion of the NFL offseason, all I can say at this point is to be patient. A lot of things can still happen between now and the start of the regular season. Personally, I will be surprised if the Week 1 53-man roster doesn't include at least one player who wasn't with the team once its mandatory minicamp ended. History, after all, indicates more help is on the way for the 2024 Steelers.\n\nRelated Items:Denzel Mims, Desmond King II, Jesse Davis, Kwon Alexander, Larry Ogunjobi, Malik Reed, Trenton Thompson Recommended for you Steelers Waive S Trenton Thompson 2024 Stock Watch - WR Denzel Mims What Are Steelers Going To Do With Open Roster Spot?", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_bryan@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Dave Bryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ogunjobi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Ogunjobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwon_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kwon Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_King_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desmond King (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Mims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Mims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trenton Thompson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/College and University", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/College and University", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kwon-alexander-desmond-king-2023-getty-images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The second-year man showed some promise last season before suffering an injury that ended his season. It is unclear why the Steelers are releasing him, but he seemingly participated in the offseason program.\n\nTrenton Thompson probably wasn't going to change the Steelers' season. Still, I was hoping to watch him compete for a spot on the 53-man roster this year. A former college free agent, he got an opportunity to play last year due to injury. He made the most of it, registering 22 tackles, an interception, and three passes defensed in six games, one start.\n\nThe Steelers announced they waived Thompson yesterday, however. While they can always re-sign him at a later date, which happens from time to time, this likely signals the end of his time with the team. They also waived WR Denzel Mims, so they have two open roster spots. In other words, you can't explain the move by suggesting they're preparing to make a move. They could make a move, of course, but they didn't need to make this particular move.\n\nI suspect that it could be a good sign for rookie Ryan Watts, who spent a lot of time at safety during the spring. A college cornerback, they are using him throughout the secondary. Thompson is only one safety out of the way, however. They still have Minkah Fitzpatrick, DeShon Elliott, Damontae Kazee, and Miles Killebrew, all presumed locks.\n\nTrenton Thompson logged 212 defensive snaps for the Steelers last season, along with 58 special teams snaps. A college free agent out of San Diego St., he played one game with the New York Giants in 2022. He earned playing time following injuries to Fitzpatrick and Keanu Neal.\n\nUnfortunately for Thompson, he suffered a neck injury that ultimately ended his season. The injury prevented him from securing a golden opportunity to start at the end of the year. Due to injuries, the Steelers ended up starting Patrick Peterson and Eric Rowe in the final weeks.\n\nAs the season progresses, Steelers players' stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year, with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications, particularly when players lose their jobs, or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions, whether minor or major.\n\nA bad game, a new contract, an injury, a promotion -- any number of things affect a player's value. Think of it as a stock on the market, based on speculation. You'll feel better about a player after a good game, or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor, while others are likely to be quite drastic, so bear in mind the degree. I'll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.\n\nRelated Items:Trenton Thompson Recommended for you Pittsburgh Steelers 2024 Transactions Tracker History Indicates More Additions On Way For Steelers Post-Mandatory Minicamp Steelers Waive S Trenton Thompson", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trenton Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damontae_Kazee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damontae Kazee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Killebrew", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Killebrew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_University", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego State University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Peterson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Peterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keanu Neal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trenton-Thompson-interception-JaMarr-Chase1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Both men's killers remain at large.\n\nThe first of what proved to be two fatal shootings occurred about 8 a.m. on Saturday, June 15, near T&M Market at the intersection of Genesee and Webber streets on the city's East Side. Police arrived to find 30-year-old Johnell S. Whittington suffering from at least one gunshot wound.\n\nWhittington was taken to an area hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds.\n\nThe second shooting occurred less than 24 hours later.\n\nSaturday night and into early Sunday morning, June 16, Saginaw police officers were assigned to proactively patrol the Old Town business district in response to ongoing issues with large, disorderly groups congregating in the area. Around 1:45 a.m., officers were dispersing one crowd in the 100 block of South Hamilton Street when they heard several gunshots from the 100 block of North Hamilton Street.\n\nAnother large crowd had congregated there, in front of West Side Party Store. Officers radioed for backup as civilians scattered.\n\nMichigan State Police troopers arrived within second and found Daquan L. Mims, 25, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Officers began administering life-saving measures as a disorderly crowd interfered with their efforts.\n\nMims was taken to an area hospital, where he too died of his wounds. Meanwhile, a 24-year-old man arrived at the hospital suffering from a minor grazing wound he sustained in the same incident.\n\n\"There were dozens of people gathered within feet of each other when the victim was gunned down,\" police said in a press release. \"We are asking someone to contact us with the identity of the shooter as he is currently not identified.\"\n\nMims' shooting occurred a block away from a \"pride banner\" hanging from a light post bearing the photo of Mazzie D. Rudison, an 18-year-old Arthur Hill High School student shot and killed July 25 in Buena Vista Township. No one has been arrested in Rudison's killing.\n\nWhittington's and Mims' deaths are the city's 10th and 11th homicides of 2024. All but one resulted from gunfire, the outlier being a hit-and-run. Saginaw recorded 15 homicides in 2023, the lowest in three years.\n\nAnother recent incident occurred the morning of June 10 within an unauthorized marijuana grow operation at 2006 S. Niagara St. In that incident, 51-year-old Owen M. Pipkins allegedly shot a 42-year-old colleague in his chest, the bullet severing the wounded man's spine.\n\nPipkins called 911 himself and surrendered when police arrived. As of June 17, the victim remains alive while Pipkins is jailed on charges of assault with intent to murder and felony firearm.\n\nPolice are actively investigating both homicides. Those with information specific to Mims' death are urged to call Saginaw Police Detective Martin Blank at 989-759-1231, while tipsters on either homicide can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-422-5245.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saginaw,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saginaw, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saginaw, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesee_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genesee County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Genesee County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hill_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Hill High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipkins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime Stoppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niagara County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Niagara County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buena_Vista_Charter_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buena Vista Charter Township, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buena Vista Charter Township, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/QOKPNJFF4BET7PPB4MX37KXRCU.jpg?auth=699d09345a6cf9bef4edbd3236c05e12a2518f7234d8fda0d08c97fcda50df1f&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662793", "eventUri": "eng-9662793", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saginaw, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 226}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 601, "textEnd": 608}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1946}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 2282, "textEnd": 2289}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 2576, "textEnd": 2583}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

There are already changes due to Pittsburgh's most recent transactions, but we will adjust as we approach training camp. Next Monday, we'll be predicting the defense and adjusting the offense.\n\nHere is the offense we produced this past Monday:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nRussell Wilson\n\nJustin Fields\n\nKyle Allen\n\nPractice Squad - John Rhys Plumlee\n\nNo surprises here. Three quarterbacks with a fourth stashed on the practice squad. We considered going with two on the 53-man roster due to the new emergency quarterback rules but kept the belt-and-suspenders approach the Steelers have used in the past.\n\nRunning Backs\n\nNajee Harris\n\nJaylen Warren\n\nCordarrelle Patterson\n\nDaijun Edwards\n\nPractice Squad - La'Mical Perine and Jonathan Ward\n\nArthur Smith's offense emphasizes more running back and tight end play. So, we loaded up on running backs knowing that Patterson will primarily be a kick returner.\n\nTight Ends\n\nPat Freiermuth\n\nDarnell Washington\n\nRodney Williams\n\nConnor Heyward - (TE/FB)\n\nPractice Squad - MyCole Pruitt and FB Jack Colletto\n\nWe hope that Darnell Washington gets more targets along with Freiermuth this season. Rodney Williams kept for his special teams contributions over Pruitt. Also, we thought a nine-year veteran might make it to the practice squad. We debated whether the Steelers would keep a true fullback along with Heyward but decided that the Steelers would go with Heyward and activate Colletto from the practice squad for certain games.\n\nWide Receivers\n\nGeorge Pickens\n\nVan Jefferson\n\nCalvin Austin III\n\nRoman Wilson\n\nDez Fitzpatrick\n\nDenzel Mims (Steelers released Mims after we made this prediction)\n\nPractice Squad - Quez Watkins\n\nThe first four receivers are obvious choices. But then we could not decide whether the Steelers would keep five or six receivers on the roster. We believe the Steelers may sign or trade for another receiver but will wait until that happens. A little surprised Mims was released before training camp since he stayed on the practice squad most of last season, though he was never activated.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nBroderick Jones\n\nTroy Fautanu\n\nDan Moore\n\nJames Daniels\n\nIsaac Seumalo\n\nNate Herbig\n\nZach Frazier\n\nMason McCormick\n\nPractice Squad - Spencer Anderson and Dylan Cook\n\nWe wanted to keep one or two others on the 53-man roster but needed to save room for the defense and specialists. Versatility is a key, so Herbig stayed on to backup Frazier and the guards. Anderson can play all the offensive line positions, so a valuable practice squad addition we hope goes unnoticed.\n\nSpecialists\n\nChris Boswell\n\nCameron Johnston\n\nChristian Kuntz\n\nThe specialists don't have much competition. Matthew Wright is a practice squad possibility, but we already have eight of 16 slots filled.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe had 25 offensive players in our initial prediction, but with Mims' release we now have 24. Next week, we'll select the defense and make any adjustments to the offense based on new transactions. Did we miss any offensive player on the current roster we should have included? Let us know.\n\nYour Song Selection\n\nI always like to include a bit of music. The Steelers 2024 season seems so far away from me. But training camp is just weeks away now. Here is So Far Away performed by Dire Straits.\n\nRelated Items:Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Buy Or Sell: Steelers Making A Mistake By Not Signing James Daniels To Extension Cameron Heyward

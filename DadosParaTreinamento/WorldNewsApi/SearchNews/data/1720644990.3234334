Muhammad Talukdar began sexually abusing his victim in 1998 in Tower Hamlets, east London. However, an inquiry into the 51-year-olds heinous crimes did not start until over 20 years later. The Metropolitan Police began investigating Talukdar in 2020. It took time for the force to build a case against him as they had no DNA evidence or recent witness accounts to help strengthen the investigation. Nevertheless, the determined coppers worked tirelessly to build a case against Talukdar. They carried out extensive interviews with friends and family of the victim and gathered detailed medical records to show the extent of the abuse. Talukdar's victim also gave permission for the police to read notes from her counselling sessions. Muhammad Talukdar began sexually abusing his victim in 1998 in Tower Hamlets, east London.

The former Love Islander took to her Instagram stories to open up about how she hasn't had filler for almost five years. She also shared a picture of when she had the most injectables in her face. Along with the clip she wrote: \"We've come a long way,\" along with five shocked face emojis. Speaking to the camera, the mum-of-one said: \"The other day I was actually having a moment of reflection on my filler journey and I realise I haven't had filler now in coming up to five years, well over four years. \"I haven't had any filler put into my face which if you remember my filler debacle, my filler scandal it's quite, not an achievement but it's quite a journey to reflect on really. It's been so long.\" Molly-Mae then went on to talk about how she has been using a new product to mimic the look of fillers. She said: \"I've fallen in love with a new skincare product recently and I truly feel like it's down to products like these that have helped me on this journey and steered me away from injectables.\" She then demonstrates a hyaluronic acid product which is good for plumping up the skin. This comes as Molly-Mae was branded as \"too young\" for promoting the L'Oreal range. The 25-year-old has promoted the cosmetics brand recently on social media. And she's understood to feature in an advert for some hyaluronic acid products in its Revitalift range, which has been described as \"anti-ageing skin care\". It includes an \"anti-wrinkle serum,\" which is said to \"intensely hydrate\" the skin as well as \"replump lines and wrinkles,\" for example. Whilst another product, which is an \"eye serum,\" is said to \"visibly brighten dark circles and replump eye lines\". The reality TV star has reportedly attracted negative feedback over her inclusion as part of the marketing of the products. Some fans are said to have suggested she isn't \"age appropriate\" for the range. The outlet published an advert for the range by Boots that features Molly-Mae, alongside a series of comments referencing the influencer. One person commented: \"Molly Mae is only 24. She doesn't need any plumping!\" Another reportedly urged: \"Come on L'Oreal/Boots please use age appropriate models!\" Whilst a third person is quoted as saying: \"She's 24 and wrinkle free!\" This comes as Molly-Mae appeared to have been invited to the Cannes Film Festival by L'Or\u00e9al Paris earlier this month. She shared photos from the trip to to the city in France on Instagram and mentioned the cosmetics brand in the post's caption.

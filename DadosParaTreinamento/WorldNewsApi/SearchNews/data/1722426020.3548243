Axios reports that the Democratic leader had quietly tapped some political allies ahead of of Thursday's debate in Atlanta where nearly 50 million viewers watched the 81-year-old mumble and stumble in his effort to secure a second White House term and head off former President Donald Trump. The outlet points to Schumer's inside intel that he was bracing for a debate dud by Biden. ALSO READ: Rep. Byron Donalds, his gigantic Jim Crow myth and a forgotten fact about Black voters And Biden did his worst. Schumer, according to Axios, apparently was pleased the debate that occurred remarkably early in the election contest \u2014 because it \"would give Biden time to recover from a potentially poor showing\" and \"it would also give the Democratic Party more time to consider the best way forward.\" So far, the groundswell chirping about Biden needing to call it after just one term hasn't had many going public by name. But Axios notes that any move to convince the president that he should sit this one out and let fresh blood take over would have to involve senior leaders like Schumer's. A statement to the outlet by a Schumer spokesperson reads: \"Leader Schumer has always supported and continues to support President Biden as the nominee and believes he will be re-elected.\" And Schumer appeared to stamp his endorsement after what has been roundly considered a debacle of a debate for Biden's candidacy. \"Tonight's debate made the choice clear: Four more years of progress, or four more years of attacks on our fundamental rights and our democracy,\" reads a post on Twitter/X. We've got to get out the vote for @JoeBiden, @KamalaHarris, and a Democratic Senate and House!\" Biden had prepped for several days at Camp David and still was struggling to compete to make clear points and amplify his substance. Already, the Biden campaign's trying to turn the page from Atlanta. At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, a more invigorated Biden admitted he's lost a step, but he's still the same tough guy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who brought the country back from the scourge of pandemic. \"I don't walk as easy as I used to,\" he said. \"I don't speak as well as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do well: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong and I know how to do this job. And I know how to get things done.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer-d-ny-quietly-hedged-president-joe-biden-s-implosion.jpg?id=27023586&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C39%2C0%2C40\"/><br/><br/><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) quietly predicted President Joe Biden's implosion. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/29/schumer-debate-fears-come-true-biden?utm_campaign=editorial&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">Axios</a> reports that the Democratic leader had quietly tapped some political allies ahead of of Thursday's debate in Atlanta where nearly 50 million viewers watched the 81-year-old mumble and stumble in his effort to secure a second White House term and head off former President Donald Trump. </p><p>The outlet points to Schumer's inside intel that he was bracing for a debate dud by Biden. </p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/byron-donalds-jim-crow-trump/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_s", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/schumer-pre-debate-jitters-joe-biden/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer-d-ny-quietly-hedged-president-joe-biden-s-implosion.jpg?id=27023586&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C64%2C0%2C64", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:23:04", "author": "M.L.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills husband, 54, was photographed kissing a mystery woman in Mykonos on Wednesday, more than a year after he separated from his wife of 27 years, Kyle Richards.\n\nIn the photos obtained by TMZ, Umansky was greeted enthusiastically at the Mykonos airport by a blonde woman wearing sunglasses, a black bikini, and a semi-sheer bathing suit coverup. The Buying Beverly Hills star embraced the woman in the photos, hugging and kissing her after getting his bags.\n\nThe PDA moment comes a year after Umansky and Richards confirmed they had separated. \"Any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue,\" the Bravo stars announced on Instagram July 3, 2023, in response to reports of their split. \"However, yes, we have had a rough year, the most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone's part.\"\n\nBoth Umansky and Richards have been the subject of relationship rumors in the days that followed. The Real Housewives star, 55, has repeatedly denied a romantic relationship with country singer Mogan Wade, saying time and time again that she and the 29-year-old are just friends.\n\nUmansky also denied having a romantic relationship with his Dancing With the Stars partner Emma Slater last year after the duo was photographed holding hands during his time on the reality dance competition. Then in December, Umansky shared photos and videos on Instagram of him skiing with Brazilian artist Anitta, 31, and YouTube star LeLe Pons, 28, both of whom were clad only in towels and skis. That same month, the real estate mogul was spotted with influencer Alexandria Wolfe, 31, in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nIn February, Richards told Entertainment Tonight that she and Umansky are \"free to do what we want\" in terms of dating outside of their marriage amid the separation. The former couple insists they split on good terms, even living together in their shared marital home until May, when Richards revealed her ex had moved out.\n\nMost recently, the exes got together with daughters Alexia, 28, Sophia, 24, and Portia, 16, to celebrate Umansky's birthday in June. Richards told ET in February that she and Umansky hadn't decided to divorce yet, but that what she needs to see from Umansky in order to decide to stay together \"is a very big question ... I don't know if I can answer...\" She continued, \"I just hope that no matter what, that we always have love and respect for each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykonos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bikini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Slater", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Slater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dancing with the Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anitta_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anitta (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aspen, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aspen, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/07/18/b92765e1-66e0-4cc9-bc67-390927be4f88/mauricio-umansky.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The two briefly paused and stared at each other while continuing to smile and hug.\n\nAfter a few moments, they kissed while still holding onto each other.\n\nThe woman appeared to be very enamored by Umansky as she kicked back one of her heels in the air just like Anne Hathaway famously did in the \"Princess Diaries.\"\n\nUmansky, 54, wore a white short-sleeve T-shirt, dark green pants and black sneakers. He also wore a black backpack and carried a few pieces of luggage.\n\nLike Umansky, the mystery woman went for a laid-back look as she sported a long-sleeve white semi-sheer cover up that she had on over a black bikini.\n\nShe added light brown slides and black sunglasses to further conceal her identity. Her honey blond locks were loosely curled and fell down her back.\n\nIt's unclear what Umansky is doing on the Greek island, and he has not yet shared any videos or photos from his getaway.\n\nUmansky didn't return Page Six's request for comment.\n\nThis new PDA moment comes a little over a year since Page Six confirmed he and Richards had separated after 27 years of marriage.\n\nUmansky and Richards, 55, have since confirmed that they are allowed to date other people.\n\n\"She said to me, 'Listen, the rules are that, you know, you go out, you date, you do whatever it is that you wanna do. Like, I'm not going to be asking you what you're doing. I don't want you to be asking me what I'm doing. Like, we are separated,'\" Umansky said of Richards during a Season 2 episode of \"Buying Beverly Hills.\"\n\nThe reality TV couple -- who share three biological daughters in addition to Richards' daughter from her first marriage -- have been seen putting on a united front with their kids many times since their separation.\n\nMost recently, the whole family got together to celebrate Umansky's 54th birthday last month and youngest daughter Portia's 16th birthday in March.\n\nEven after both of them confirmed their split, they continued living together in their shared marital home until May when Richards confessed that Umansky moved out.\n\n\"I always knew when that day came it would feel strange, very real all of a sudden. And that's exactly what happened. I'm a mom of four, I have a busy household,\" she said during the May 14 episode of the \"Bitch Bible\" podcast.\n\nRichards has not been publicly seen with any potential suitors since the split. She has also shut down romance speculation with country singer Morgan Wade several times.\n\nUmansky, however, was reportedly seen getting cozy with a blond woman in November. Prior to that, he also sparked romance rumors with his \"Dancing With the Stars\" partner Emma Slater when they were photographed holding hands, but they each denied being anything more than friends.\n\nIn December, Umansky posted an Instagram Story of him skiing with Anitta and YouTube star LeLe Pons -- who were both wearing only towels and skis while sipping on champagne.

In photos obtained by the Daily Mail, Umansky embraced the woman as she wrapped her arms around his neck and planted a kiss on his lips.\n\nUmansky sported a white T-shirt, army green pants and black sneakers while arriving at the airport. The woman, meanwhile, greeted him in a white, long-sleeved cover-up worn on top of a bikini set. She completed her look with a pair of black sunglasses and nude slides.\n\nThe woman's identity has yet to be confirmed. Umansky was previously seen getting cozy with another mystery blonde during a visit to Texas back in November 2023. \"He was all over her,\" a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. \"There was no kissing, but they were getting very close.\"\n\nUmansky's recent public PDA session comes one year after he and his estranged wife, Kyle Richards, announced they were parting ways after 27 years of marriage. \"We have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously,\" they wrote in a joint Instagram statement at the time. \"There has been no wrongdoing on anyone's part.\"\n\nNot long after news of their split broke, Richards, 55, shut down speculation that she had moved on with country singer Morgan Wade. Umansky, for his part, sparked relationship rumors with several famous women, including his Dancing With the Stars partner Emma Slater and singer Anitta, both of which were denied by Umansky and Richards.\n\nRichards and Umansky opened up about their split on their respective reality series, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Buying Beverly Hills.\n\nEarlier this year, another insider exclusively told Us that the duo were holding off on officially filing for divorce. \"They don't have a prenup, so Kyle will be getting half of everything, but that doesn't bother Mauricio,\" the source explained, adding that their split they were \"in an OK place\" despite their breakup feeling \"so final.\"\n\nIn May, Us confirmed that Umansky had moved out of their shared home and into a luxury Hollywood condo. \"That was weird,\" Richards said of Umansky's move on the May 14 episode of \"The Bitch Bible\" podcast. \"I always knew that when that day came, it would feel strange.

Umansky, 54, was greeted by a seemingly younger woman who appeared very eager to see him. Paparazzi snapped photos of the duo's ensuing PDA, but some fans feel the photos look very staged.\n\nIn July 2024, a series of paparazzi photos showed Umansky embracing and then kissing a woman with dirty blonde hair as he rolled his luggage through the Greece airport just after getting off the plane. After the photos of the wealthy businessman and his airport greeter surfaced online, fans had questions. Some thought it seemed convenient that the snaps were so perfectly timed.\n\n\"These photos look staged,\" one Reddit user wrote.\n\n\"These photos conveniently taken from like 5 feet away inside the Mykonos airport perfectly capturing their kiss... lol,\" another wrote on X.\n\n\"Almost as if a call was made....\" another replied, along with a GIF of Richards looking sneaky.\n\n\"These are such odd photos. Like was someone standing right next to them with their phone up?\" another wanted to know.\n\n\"Those incredibly staged pap photos of Mauricio kissing another woman are exhausting. There were just paps in a Mykonos airport? #RHOBH,\" another asked.\n\nThe photos of Umansky and his mystery woman come one year after he and Richards confirmed their separation after 27 years of marriage. The longtime couple previously said they have no plans to divorce, but Umansky has since moved out of the family's Encino, California mansion and into his own place.\n\nDuring an Amazon Live in April, Richards admitted she stopped going to couples therapy with Umansky. \"We're just taking a break from that, [but] we get along very well and we're really good friends,\" she said.\n\nRichards also previously answered a fan who asked on her Amazon Live if there was any chance she would get back together with Umansky. \"That's way too intense of a question for the Amazon Live today,\" the mom of four replied. \"But he's great no matter what. With or without [me].\"\n\nIn late June, Umansky hinted that the ball was in Richards' court regarding a possible reconciliation. When he was asked by TMZ if he was close to reconciling with his wife nearly a year after announcing their separation, Umansky responded, \"Oh my God, I have no idea. You gotta ask somebody else that question.\"\n\nIt is unclear if Umansky's trip to Greece is for business or strictly for pleasure. In June, The Agency founder told Bisnow he had a heavy travel schedule coming up. \"I'm going to basically be traveling all of July. And to start my vacation, I'm checking myself into a meditation yoga retreat in Switzerland,\" Umansky said in the interview.\n\nAs for Richards, during a June 2024 Amazon Live, she admitted she hadn't planned her family's usual summer vacation yet. Last summer, Umansky still traveled with her and their daughters to Italy, despite their separation.\n\nAs of this writing, Richards, who is in the thick of filming the 14 season of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" has not publicly responded to the photos of Umansky kissing his mystery woman.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_miller@heavy.com", "name": "Victoria Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykonos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal digital assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GIF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encino,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encino, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Encino, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/News-66.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

What's certain, though, is that if there was any chance of him rekindling his marriage/relationship with Richards, that is clearly off the table if he's being seen publicly kissing another woman.", "source": {"uri": "okmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadarOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_richards@okmagazine.com", "name": "Matt Richards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykonos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/lUJo84DM3/1200x628/matts-image-templates-2-1721246463205.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Umansky, 54, was spotted navigating the Mykonos Airport with his luggage when he saw the woman and held his arms out to greet her.\n\nThe two were then photographed coming together in a tight embrace before sharing a kiss and hugging again, with Umansky's arms wrapped around the woman's back and her hands clasped together behind his neck.\n\nThe real estate agent was dressed in a white T-shirt, green pants and black sneakers that matched his black luggage. The woman appeared to be wearing a black bikini beneath her breezy white cover-up, which she paired with a pair of tan slip-on shoes and dark sunglasses.\n\nIt was not immediately clear to fans who Umansky's mystery woman was. See the photos of their PDA-filled greeting here.\n\nThe snapshots of the Buying Beverly Hills star's arrival in Mykonos were taken a little more than one year after he and his wife, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kyle Richards, announced that they had decided to separate after 27 years of marriage.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 55, took to Instagram on Thursday, July 18, to mark the personal milestone just days after her estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, was photographed kissing a mystery woman in Mykonos, Greece.\n\n\"This week was my 2 year anniversary of being alcohol free (July 15th) I can remember a time when the idea of going 2 weeks seemed impossible,\" Richards wrote on Instagram alongside a strong gym selfie. \"I'm proud of the fact that I've had the willpower to stay on this path. I know many people would love for me to start drinking again. Even friends with the best of intentions. Everyone loved 'Party Kyle.' I think that was the hardest part of all of this. The resistance from others.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Kyle Richards (@kylerichards18)\n\nAs a former \"people pleaser,\" the Bravo star said it was tough to move past the lack of \"encouragement\" she received earlier in her sober journey. \"But I've dropped enough splits and whipped enough pony tails to know when it's time to call it a day,\" she continued, joking, \"Ok, I may still drop a split here and there. Sorry.\"\n\nThe Halloween Ends actress revealed that a change came when her mental and physical health became more important to her than \"feeling like I had to be 'on' at a party or social setting.\" She concluded her lengthy message: \"It would have been a lot harder going through these difficult times if I had been drinking. I want to wake up every day feeling my best. Mentally & physically strong enough to face whatever comes my way. ....Personally , I prefer to see people and situations just as they are. AND without the hangxiety.\"\n\nWhile the reality personality didn't go into details about the difficult times she was experiencing, the post came just days after Umansky, 54, was spotted kissing a blonde woman at the Mykonos airport amid his marital separation. Richards was quick to remove \"wife\" from her Instagram bio after the photos were published, having previously dropped the Buying Beverly Hills star's last name from her Instagram profile in May.\n\nUmansky and Richards have not yet filed for divorce after confirming in July 2023 that they had separated after 27 years of marriage.

Umansky and her family must navigate divorce dynamics on RHOBH Season 14 and BBH . Despite rumors of separate romantic lives, Richards and Umansky are in no rush to divorce, prioritizing family.\n\nKyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky's sudden split came as a shock to everyone, especially their four daughters. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Buying Beverly Hills star Alexia Umansky has been dealing with their split like her sisters and the fans of the reality shows, who never saw this split coming. Dealing with divorce in the family is never easy, but it can bring families closer, and that is what happened to Umansky and her father. In a conversation with Us Weekly, Umansky opened up about her relationship with her father and how the split made them closer.\n\n\"My mom and I -- we've always had a very honest relationship,\" she shared, \"But I've got to say my dad has opened up so much more since the filming process with his daughters. He's so honest, and our communication has just completely excelled since this experience.\"\n\nRichards and Umansky had been married for 27 years before they announced their separation last year, which made things hard for Richards on the show. Fans saw how the separation affected the family on and off the show. The estranged couple did not spend Easter together, and Richards did not celebrate Umansky on Father's Day. He also moved out of their family home. However, there is no bad blood between the estranged couple, and the family are getting through the split together.\n\nThe Family Must Navigate The Divorce On 'RHOBH' Season 14 and 'BBH'\n\nUmansky works with her sisters Sophia Umansky and Farrah Brittany at The Agency with their father in real estate. Umansky was always close with her father, and filming a show about their real estate ventures allowed them to be closer. She opened up on how it was hard to have difficult conversations with her parents about their separation on camera because they happened \"sooner\" than she was ready for. But, having those tough conversations helped the family improve their communication.\n\n\"We've always all been so close,\" she said, \"but we're finally good at confrontation and hard conversations, which is not something we did before. We were always positive. It was a learning curve for us: it's OK to talk about the hard things, it leads to more positivity.\"\n\nDespite separating, the pair are in no rush to divorce. Richards and Umansky did also spark rumours about their separate romantic lives - Richards being involved with singer Morgan Wade as well as Umansky being captured kissing a woman in Greece. The former couple are taking their time with their divorce to put their family first and they are content in their current situation.\n\nRichards is returning to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after a difficult Season 13. Her daughters had to navigate their split when filing Buying Beverly Hills, and now Richards must do the same challenge in the upcoming season. Fans are looking to see their relationship dynamics be featured on camera as Richards works through this life-changing event. Richards said that she was \"provoked\" in this new season, so more drama awaits in the upcoming season.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is available to stream on Peacock in the U.S.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills TV-14Reality TV\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills offers an inside look at the glamorous lives of affluent women in Beverly Hills.

Sources indicated that Umansky's move was driven by his shifting living situation with Richards, further fueling speculation about their marriage status.\n\nWhile rumors of a split have swirled for months, an insider revealed that Richards and Umansky \"have been living separately for the last few months.\"\n\nThe source noted that the move improved their dynamic as Richards plans to stay in their primary residence, while Umansky \"will frequently visit\" during her absences.\n\nHowever, even with this new arrangement, the former pair are not yet ready to discuss divorce. The insider claims that the primary reason is the financial complexities surrounding \"The Agency,\" the real estate company co-founded by Umansky.\n\nAfter Umansky's recent photo op with a mystery blonde, one would expect Richards to stand by him, especially given his supportive stance regarding her friendship with Wade.\n\nThe Blast reported that Umansky acknowledged the undeniable connection between Richards and the country music star. The TV personality admitted this during a candid conversation with a coworker on Netflix's \"Buying Beverly Hills,\" saying:\n\n\"They definitely have some sort of a connection together; there's no question about that. They spend a lot of time together.\"\n\nDespite his awareness of their bond, the 54-year-old expressed a hesitance to pry deeper. He emphasized:\n\n\"Maybe one of the reasons I don't want to ask is because I don't want to put the extra pressure on her. If it's working for her and it's giving her the opportunity to be dealing with our separation ...

And the messaging is hard-to-miss and downright severe.\n\nAre Kyle and Mauricio still married? That question has haunted The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fans since the first rumors of Kyle's separation hit tabloids.\n\nKyle is making her status with Mauricio a little clearer.\n\nShe no longer describes herself as a \"wife.\" And Mauricio clearly feels the same.\n\nOn Thursday, July 18, Kyle Richards edited her Instagram bio.\n\nShe no longer describes herself as \"wife\" on her list of titles and roles. \"Mom, actor, author, producer, animal lover, a RHOBH, CAA,\" are all still there.\n\nNot updating your bio can be a simple oversight. Updating it like that is deliberate ... and feels like an announcement to the world.\n\nKyle Richards did not opt to explain her updated bio in the bio itself. However, many of those who've been following her personal drama have a theory as to what prompted it.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 16, Mauricio appeared on camera smooching an unknown woman in Mykonos after disembarking from a plane.\n\nYes, they're separated. But there's a spectrum of \"separation.\" Mauricio and Kyle have the kind of separation where one of them is freely making out with someone else, in public. That says a lot.\n\nDuring the spring, Kyle Richards dropped Mauricio's last name from her bio.\n\nFor a lot of obvious reasons, the entire world knows Kyle as Kyle Richards anyway. But her bio did list her as Kyle Richards Umansky. For decades, their marriage was rock solid.\n\nKyle also purged \"Umansky\" from her Twitter account. She did not drop \"wife\" from her Twitter bio, but that social media platform has lost so much relevance that it's probably an oversight. Kyle probably didn't think to update MySpace or Xanga, either.\n\nIt has been just over a year since Kyle and Mauricio opted to split.\n\nThis came after 27 years of marriage. Kyle and Mauricio share three daughters: Sophia, Alexia, and Portia.\n\nFor the better part of three decades, many Bravoholics upheld Kyle and Mauricio's marriage as an exception to the reality TV divorce curse. Now, they've been living separate lives and seem to be drifting further apart.\n\nThe same day that Kyle made that \"little\" edit to her bio, she also shared a gym selfie to Instagram. In addition to affirming her MILF credentials, she shared that she was celebrating two years without alcohol.\n\n\"This week was my 2 year anniversary of being alcohol free (July 15th) I can remember a time when the idea of going 2 weeks seemed impossible,\" Kyle wrote in the caption. \"I'm proud of the fact that I've had the willpower to stay on this path.\"\n\nWe are all proud of Kyle for celebrating this milestone. It seems that she's really transforming her life. Fans are interested in seeing where this journey of changes will take her.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykonos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyslexia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/03/0328_kylerichards_01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 424}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 946, "textEnd": 953}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 2433, "textEnd": 2442}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The two reportedly began dating in 2010 and made their last red carpet-appearance in 2017.\n\nInstagram gossip account Deux Moi was the first to reveal her identity.\n\nPage Six previously obtained photos of Umansky and Kahn passionately embracing each other and locking lips at the Mykonos Airport on Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Buying Beverly Hills\" star, 54, was seen arriving from an unknown destination before he instantly lit up and opened his arms wide when he saw his new lady.\n\nShe held onto his neck and stood on her tiptoes to pull him close while he wrapped his arms around her waist.\n\nUmansky has not publicly addressed the rendezvous or posted on social media about his vacation and new romance.\n\nShortly after the photos surfaced, \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" fans noticed Richards had removed \"wife\" from her bio.\n\n\"Mom, actor, author,producer,animal lover, a RHOBH , CAA,\" it reads now.\n\nThe Bravolebrity, 55, did not share why she wiped the title from her page, but she did celebrate her second sobriety anniversary Thursday.\n\n\"I want to wake up every day feeling my best.

Fans have spent years watching the lives of these women play out, especially OGs like Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Kyle Richards. She subtly fired back at Mauricio Umansky in the midst of split drama, and I'm totally on her side. Somebody cue the RHOBH theme song!\n\nKyle and Mauricio's marriage issues took center stage for the last season of RHOBH, with fans wondering if they'd be able to work through it. While some fans thought that Kyle and Mo didn't actually split, there's been mounting evidence that their marriage might be over. And after Mauricio was recently photographed kissing a woman in an airport, Kyle has removed the word \"wife\" from her bio on Instagram. And after months of public shenanigans, I'm personally glad that OG of Beverly Hills is finally firing back.\n\nOver the last year, it's been obvious that the Richards-Umansky clan has had some trouble. But Kyle supported his run on Dancing with The Stars, and filmed his show Buying Beverly Hills (which can be streamed with a Netflix subscription). Unfortunately, that level of respect seemingly wasn't reciprocated by Mo, which is why Kyle is finally fighting back.\n\nThis new photos of Mauricio kissing a woman in an airport likely could have been avoided, as it's a very public place to make such a declaration of affection. And given the timing of Kyle removing \"wife\" from her IG bio, fans assume that it's a direct response to those viral images of her husband circulating online.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time that Umansky has made headlines for his behavior in the midst of his separation from Kyle Richards. Back in December he went viral for photos of him drinking and skiing with two women wearing nothing but towels. And during his time competing on Dancing with the Stars, he was photographed holding hands with his coach Emma Slater.\n\nThroughout all this drama, Kyle Richards has largely been keeping her cards close to the chest. While she's admitted that it's been an emotional struggle, she hasn't come out publicly against her husband... despite what fans might be saying. Removing the word \"wife\" from her IG isn't exactly a declaration of war, but it shows that she's standing up for her public image in the midst of their marital issues.\n\nKyle is the longest running cast member on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and we've seen her bare it all and fight with her siblings and friends during the last 13 seasons. And that's why I'm ready for her to stand in her power after all the shenanigans that Mo has been up to over the last year. We'll just have to see if that includes her infamous friendship with Morgan Wade.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_chichizola@cinemablend.com", "name": "Corey Chichizola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theme music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wade_(singer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wade (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dancing with the Stars (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Slater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Slater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7FcqtMomWv3ZgFpjcFaga-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The couple have been mainstays on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since the debut season. We've watched the ups and downs throughout their marriage, ending in their separation last season.\n\nMauricio and Kyle's breakup has not been without its drama. It's nearly impossible for the RHOBH fans to keep up with the cheating accusations, moving details, and everything else that goes into an end so massive. This week, Mauricio caused a stir after he was caught kissing a mystery woman in public. Now, we know who the potential new woman in Mo's life actually is.\n\nMauricio's new woman?\n\nAccording to gossip site DeuxMoi, Mauricio was spotted kissing Nikita Kahn, a 33-year-old Ukranian-American actress, model, and entrepreneur. She was in the public eye for her last relationship with Larry Ellison, a tech billionaire who is the co-founder of Oracle technology company. According to Bloomberg, he's the seventh richest person in the world. Now that is quite the act for Mauricio to follow, wallet-wise.\n\nOtherwise, Nikita has a low profile. Her Instagram has just over 1,000 followers as of Thursday afternoon. According to her IMDb profile, she's set to appear in the film \"Crescent City\" sometime this year.\n\nWhile the details are sparse, it is jarring to see Mauricio kiss someone other than Kyle for the first time since the two of them have been Real Housewives stars. Who knows how serious the relationship is, but it is a shocking turn of events. It's a matter of time before we find out what Kyle thinks about all of this recent news.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery Woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeuxMoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeuxMoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikita (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMDb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Ellison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reality_tea_694/4c3bc5d8c78107541437603975dcf32b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Umansky, we have some bad news:\n\nIt seems like all hopes have been dashed, and it may be all thanks to new photos showcasing the Buying Beverly Hills star locking lips with a mystery woman.\n\nPer TMZ, Umansky was spotted in Mykonos, Greece, this week cozying up to a much younger woman with a hug and a kiss after getting off a plane.\n\nWhile the nature of their relationship has not been determined, Kyle used her social media to send a not-so-subtle message about where she's at following the bombshell.\n\nKyle has removed \"wife\" from her Instagram bio, signaling she's well and truly moving on from her 27-year marriage to the real estate mogul.\n\nTruth be told... it's been evident for some time that they're going their separate ways.\n\nKyle revealed on the RHOBH Season 13 finale that things hadn't been right between them for some time, and the series showed a conversation between the pair and their daughters.\n\nMauricio also delved into his marital woes on Buying Beverly Hills Season 2, which morphed into a Real Housewives clone to capture the drama.\n\nFor a long time, the status of their relationship was questioned, and Kyle's friendship with Morgan Wade didn't help matters.\n\nWe still don't know if those two were strictly platonic or if something was happening behind the scenes.\n\nThere were rumors that Kyle was forced to open up about their relationship to secure a contract for RHOBH Season 14, which is currently filming.\n\nThe hit show is headed in a completely new direction now that Kyle and Mauricio's relationship is over.\n\nFellow RHOBH stars Dorit Kemsley and Paul \"PK\" Kemsley have also separated, so perhaps Kyle and Dorit can bond due to all the drama in their lives.\n\nThe once inseparable friends hit a major snag last season that seemingly pushed them apart for good.\n\nErika Girardi, Garcelle Beauvais, Sutton Stracke, and newcomer Bozoma Saint John will join the duo on RHOBH Season 14.\n\nKathy Hilton and Jennifer Tilly are set to serve as friends of the housewives for the next season.\n\nCrystal Kung Minkoff and Annemarie Wiley were iced out of the show after Season 13.", "source": {"uri": "monstersandcritics.com",

And Kyle's flirty relationship with country singer Morgan Wade ain't helping matters.\n\nOf course, Mauricio was behind all the new drama with Kyle after he was filmed Tuesday smooching the mystery woman at the airport in Mykonos. As the pics show, Mauricio had just gotten off a plane and dove right into the arms of this hot blond, signaling to Kyle they are dunzo.\n\nThe real estate agent split from Kyle just over a year ago after 27 years of marriage. They share three daughters - Sophia, Alexia and Portia.\n\nThey have been leading separate lives now for well over a year, so it seems the handwriting's on the wall.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mom (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Artists_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative Artists Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wade_(singer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wade (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykonos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mykonos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/9e/16by9/2024/07/17/9e27b9da920c433a86d370aeb61da55e_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741980", "eventUri": "eng-9741980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

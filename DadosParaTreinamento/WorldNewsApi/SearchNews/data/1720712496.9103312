The So Macho singer was single for \u2018a long time\u2019 after her marriage to Andy Wilner ended in 2010, having been married for eight years. While she was comfortable with the situation, her boy Zac, 18, urged her to find someone. \u2018I didn\u2019t date for a long time. I was single for eight-and-a-half nine years,\u2019 Sinitta began. She added to New! Magazine: \u2018I think they know I\u2019m fussy and it took me a long time to find someone, so they trust that. \u2018Before I was with him, my son said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be alone all the time, all your friends are gay.\u201d She was married to Andy Wilner for eight years (Picture: Jon Furniss/WireImage) \u2018So he was more worried about my sex life than I was \u2013 but now I\u2019m ok.\u2019 Sinitta \u2013 who also has a daughter named Magdalena, 18, is very happy with her mystery man. She teased: \u2018I am dating someone and he\u2019s a really nice man. \u2018It\u2019s nice, I\u2019m happy. He\u2019s obsessed with football, but that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d rather that than other things. It\u2019s good.\u2019 The 60-year-old singer admitted seeing her children, who are both adopted, becoming adults has become a source of conflict in their home because they want to push boundaries more. She they are \u2018obsessed with going out because now that they\u2019re 18 they can and they\u2019re loving it.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re already fighting and they\u2019ve only been 18 for a minute \u2013 it\u2019s arguments every day.\u2019 Sinitta tries to explain to them that they are \u2018still under [her] roof\u2019 and \u2018not completely grown yet.\u2019 The pop star has an 18-year-old son named Zac Willner (Picture: Dave Benett) Sinitta\u2019s love life has been in the press throughout her career (Picture: MJ Kim/Getty Images) \u2018I\u2019m doing the whole, \u201cIt\u2019s my house, it\u2019s my rules\u201d thing, but it\u2019s hard.\u2019 Sinitta\u2019s love life has been highly publicised throughout her career. She famously dated Simon Cowell on-and-off in the 80s and the pair have remained close pals. So close, in fact, that they still spend Christmas together, despite Simon being in a long-term relationship with socialite and entrepreneur Lauren Silverman, with whom he shares a son. In an interview with Closer magazine, Sinitta shared that her favourite Christmases have been in Barbados with the music mogul. \u2018There\u2019s nothing like Christmas Day in the Caribbean. Santa arrives at the beach on a jet ski, and we all get dressed up for an amazing dinner. \u2018Then, on New Year\u2019s Eve, we head out on the yacht and watch the fireworks over the Sandy Lane hotel. That\u2019s definitely the best way to welcome in the New Year!\u2019 She has two adopted children (Picture: Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock) Sinitta famously dated Simon Cowell and Brad Pitt (Picture: Alan Chapman/Dave Benett/Getty Images) The So Macho hitmaker spends Christmas with the music mogul (Picture: ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Sinitta added that Simon, 63, adores \u2018spoiling everyone\u2019 for the festive season and that she\u2019s very close with his fianc\u00e9e Lauren \u2013 to whom he popped the question last Christmas \u2013 and eight-year-old Eric. Another of Sinitta\u2019s famous exes is none other than Brad Pitt, a celebrity relationship that shocks the internet whenever it resurfaces. The pop star dated the Hollywood actor, 58, on and off in the early 1980s, describing him as \u2018very kind\u2019 to her. Detailing the crazy whirlwind that was their romance amid his A-list fame, she previously said: \u2018Brad was drop-dead gorgeous, but he wasn\u2019t full of himself. He was very, very kind. \u2018I\u2019ve always dated the person who everybody else wants to be with, so I had to grow a thick skin. I\u2019ve had girls put cigarettes out on my back in order to get closer to my man, not realising that I was the girlfriend.\u2019 Got a story?

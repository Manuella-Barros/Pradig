Community balloted more than 3,000 members across all Tata Steel UK production sites, and more than 85% have voted for industrial action.\n\n\"It should be noted this resounding mandate has been delivered in spite of the company's bullying and unacceptable threats to slash redundancy payments.

This week we have continued our open and constructive discussions with Trades Union partners through the UK Steel Committee.\n\n\"We have this week put forward an extensive offer that includes the enhanced employee support package we announced on 22 March as well as a generous proposal for a skills and retraining scheme for employees who are made redundant involuntarily, which would have allowed people to elect to remain employed by the company on revised terms for up to a further year whilst they retrain and secure employment with another employer. We have paused those discussions without coming to an agreement.

This move is expected to lead to the loss of up to 2,800 jobs by the end of this year. The union that has called for a strike did not spell out a date for industrial action, said members have voted to demand a better deal for the workforce.\n\nClosing down old blast furnaces\n\nLast month, Tata Steel UK had issued a confirmation on its decision to proceed with the closure of two old blast furnaces located at its Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales. Seven months after first making the announcement, the Mumbai-headquartered steel major had said it had held several formal and informal discussions with the UK trade unions about the major transformation which preserves 5,000 jobs and secures future steel supplies.\n\nThe company also expected to create more indirect jobs in engineering and construction and reduce CO2 emissions by 5 million tonnes each year. \"Tata Steel's decision to move to greener steelmaking in Port Talbot is one that has been made by the company alone. The UK government is acting to support steelmaking in Wales and to safeguard its future,\" a statement from the UK government had said.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blast furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Talbot_Steelworks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Talbot Steelworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Talbot", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Talbot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Talbot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Employment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/Tata-Steel-TV-tata-steel-distribution-halmstad-8928_39L-logo-169988286132716_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548674", "eventUri": "eng-9548674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

I will make the case firmly for keeping Welsh Tata jobs, which are vital to not only the region but the future of manufacturing in the UK.\"\n\nIn a related development, members of the largest steelworkers' union, Community, have voted in favor of industrial action in response to Tata Steel's restructuring plans. The union reported that 85% of voting members supported the move, following the announcement of 2,800 job losses across the UK.\n\nAlun Davies, National Officer for Steel at Community, said, \"Today our members delivered their verdict on Tata Steel's job cuts plan, and they have voted to demand a better deal for the workforce. More than 85% have voted for industrial action. This resounding mandate has been delivered despite the company's attempts to intimidate workers by threatening to slash redundancy payments.\"\n\nDavies added, \"We will now consult our members on the next steps and urge Tata to reconsider their position and return to negotiations to avoid a major industrial dispute.\"", "source": {"uri": "deeside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deeside.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Talbot", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port Talbot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Talbot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blast furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric arc furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tata Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Just transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alun_Davies_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alun Davies (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(fastener)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nail (fastener)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.deeside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-06-at-16.05.44-840x630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548674", "eventUri": "eng-9548674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

backing for action", "body": "The prospect of a strike across Tata Steel's UK operations has gained further traction after a key union secured support for industrial action.\n\nCommunity, which has more than 3,000 members, said 85% voted in favour of fighting the India-owned company's plans for up to 2,800 job losses, the majority of them at the country's biggest steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales.\n\nTata confirmed last month it was to press ahead with the closure of the blast furnaces at the plant, replacing them with electric arc furnaces to reduce emissions and costs.\n\nIn doing so, the company rejected an alternative plan put forward by the Community, GMB and Unite unions that, they said, would raise productivity and protect jobs across the supply chain.\n\nThey argued that Tata's proposals would rid the UK economy of its last remaining \"virgin\" steelmaking facility and commit thousands of jobs to the scrap heap for no reason.\n\nMembers of Unite had already backed the prospect of industrial action.\n\nAlun Davies, national officer for steel at Community, said of its vote: \"Today our members delivered their verdict on Tata Steel's job cuts plan, and they have voted to demand a better deal for the workforce.\n\n\"Community balloted more than 3,000 members across all Tata Steel UK production sites, and more than 85% have voted for industrial action.\n\n\"It should be noted this resounding mandate has been delivered in spite of the company's bullying and unacceptable threats to slash redundancy payments.\n\n\"We will now be consulting our members on next steps, and we urge Tata to reconsider their position and get back around the table to head off a major industrial dispute.\"\n\nTata Steel was yet to comment.\n\nThe company has consistently argued its \u00a31.25bn investment would secure the future of UK steelmaking.\n\nIts chief executive and managing director, TV Narendran, said at the time of the investment decision on 25 April: \"Having looked carefully at all the options over the past seven months in consultation with union representatives, we have decided to proceed with our proposed restructuring and transition.\n\n\"This is the most viable proposal, in contrast to the unions' unaffordable plan which has high inherent operational and safety risk.\n\n\"Our proposal secures a long-term future for the business and preserves the majority of jobs in the UK.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel", "type":

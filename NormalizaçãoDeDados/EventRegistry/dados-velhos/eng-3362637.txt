It did not specify how many forces were wounded.\n\nAnd in three southern provinces, Taliban attacks on Wednesday killed a total of three civilians and 15 Afghan policemen, Afghan officials said Thursday.\n\nThe Utah National Guard said the American soldier who died was one of its members and that 11 other National Guardsmen were among the wounded. The names were withheld pending notification of family members.\n\nHe was clearing a building when a booby trap exploded, killed him and injured the other 11 members of the team, said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nThe wounded soldiers were evacuated for medical treatment.\n\nThe family of the slain solider identified him as Aaron Butler, 27, of Monticello, Utah. His father Randy Butler said in a statement he was a champion high school wrestler who became a Green Beret after graduating from the U.S. Army Special Forces qualification course with honors in 2016.\n\nIslamic State militants have gained a foothold in recent years in Afghanistan, where they have battled U.S.-backed government forces as well as the more established Taliban.\n\nThe IS affiliate largely consists of disgruntled former Taliban insurgents, and has clashed with the larger group over leadership and ideology.\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide car bomber killed three civilians while trying to attack an Afghan army base in the southern Helmand province late on Wednesday.\n\nOmar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker and three other militants approached the base before guards opened fire on them, killing the three who were on foot. Three soldiers were wounded in the blast.\n\nIn southern Kandahar province, Taliban fighters stormed police checkpoints in two districts late on Wednesday, killing seven policemen and wounding nine, according to Zia Durani, spokesman for the provincial governor.

Tuesday told US President Donald Trump in an open letter that the military situation in Afghanistan was \"far worse than you realize\" and that sending in more troops would be self-destructive.\n\nA senior Taliban official said the rare decision to address Trump directly was timed to coincide with the president's deliberations on the future of US policy in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,\" the Taliban said in the lengthy English-language letter.\n\n'STOOGES'\n\nThe Taliban criticized the Afghan government as \"stooges,\" \"lying, corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sellouts\" who were providing Washington with \"rosy pictures\" of the military position.\n\nThe Taliban, seeking to restore Muslim rule, has waged an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led invasion after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the US.\n\nThose attacks were planned by then-al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from a base in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize,\" the letter said, adding that the only thing preventing the Taliban from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces.\n\nInfluential voices, including US Senator John McCain, have also urged an \"enduring\" US military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nSKEPTICISM\n\nHowever, such plans have faced skepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticized years of US military intervention and foreign aid.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Monday told reporters that the Trump administration was \"very, very close\" to a decision on Afghanistan, adding that all options were on the table.\n\nHowever, US officials believe it could take weeks for a South Asia strategy to be approved.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the Taliban told Trump.\n\n\"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan, because they seek to preserve their military privileges,\" the group said.\n\nSome Taliban leaders disagreed with publishing the letter as they believe the group is close to being able to end the war on its own terms, while the \"Americans are no longer in a position to fight this never-ending war,\" one Taliban official said.\n\nThe first official said the Taliban was open to \"discuss all issues with the United States for bringing peace to Afghanistan\" if US troops are withdrawn.\n\n\"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,\" the Taliban letter said.\n\n\"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world, but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors,\" it said.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt":

insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001.\n\nIn the long statement, the Taliban criticised the Afghan government as \"stooges\", \"lying corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sell-outs\" who are providing Washington with overly optimistic \"rosy pictures\" of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realise!\" the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.\n\nThe statement also took aim at generals, who the Taliban said \"are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled\" soldiers.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said. \"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional

It did not specify how many forces were wounded.\n\nAnd in three southern provinces, Taliban attacks on Wednesday killed a total of three civilians and 15 Afghan policemen, Afghan officials said Thursday.\n\nThe Utah National Guard said the American soldier who died was one of its members and that approximately seven other National Guardsmen were among the wounded. The names were withheld pending notification of family members.\n\nThe wounded soldiers were evacuated for medical treatment.\n\nIslamic State militants have gained a foothold in recent years in Afghanistan, where they have battled U.S.-backed government forces as well as the more established Taliban.\n\nThe IS affiliate largely consists of disgruntled former Taliban insurgents, and has clashed with the larger group over leadership and ideology.\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide car bomber killed three civilians while trying to attack an Afghan army base in the southern Helmand province late on Wednesday.\n\nOmar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker and three other militants approached the base before guards opened fire on them, killing the three who were on foot. Three soldiers were wounded in the blast.\n\nIn southern Kandahar province, Taliban fighters stormed police checkpoints in two districts late on Wednesday, killing seven policemen and wounding nine, according to Zia Durani, spokesman for the provincial governor. He said 19 Taliban were killed in the ensuing clashes.\n\nAnd in southern Zabul province, the Taliban attacked a police base, killing eight policemen.\n\nA police official, Asif Tokhi, said the attack started on Wednesday night, along the Zabul-Kandahar highway, where the base is located.\n\nFighting there continued into the morning Thursday, he said. Along with the eight killed, three policemen were also wounded, and 12 Taliban fighters were also killed, Tokhi added.\n\nThe Taliban made no statements on the latest attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Taliban released an \"open letter\" to President Donald Trump, reiterating their calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after 16 years of war and warning against new U.S. military buildup in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump has so far resisted the Pentagon's recommendations to send almost 4,000 more to expand training of Afghan military forces and bolster U.S. counterterrorism operations. The deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize Afghanistan.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mirwais Khan in Kandahar, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Islamic rule in Afghanistan. -- Reuters picKABUL, Aug 15 -- The United States should withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan and stop listening to \"stooges\" in Kabul, the Taliban warned in an open letter to US President Donald Trump today.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to finalise a regional strategy that could include nearly 4,000 additional US troops, part of a NATO-led coalition, that have been requested by commanders in the country.\n\nThat plan has faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.\n\n\"Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,\" the Taliban said in the English-language letter released to media and addressed to Trump.\n\nThe Taliban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, have been waging an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001.\n\nIn the lengthy statement, the Taliban criticised the Afghan government as \"stooges\", \"lying corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sellouts\" who are providing Washington with overly optimistic \"rosy pictures\" of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!\" the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.\n\nThe statement also took aim at generals, who the Taliban said \"are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled\" soldiers.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said. \"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces.\n\nPowerful voices in the US government, including Republican Senator John McCain, have also called for an \"enduring\" US military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban letter concludes by saying the conflict could be resolved by the withdrawal of foreign troops.\n\n\"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,\" the Taliban said.\n\n\"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.\" -- Reuters", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

The deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize Afghanistan.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mirwais Khan in Kandahar, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Z\u0101bul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabul_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Z\u0101bul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47192"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47377"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47493"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47494"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Helmand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Helmand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47544"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231788"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317222", "label": {"eng": "Taliban insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322023", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "421291", "label": {"eng": "Durrani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "437893", "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1119395", "label": {"eng": "Tokhi"}}]}

It did not specify how many forces were wounded.\n\nAnd in three southern provinces, Taliban attacks on Wednesday killed a total of three civilians and 15 Afghan policemen, Afghan officials said Thursday.\n\nThe Utah National Guard said the American soldier who died was one of its members and that approximately seven other National Guardsmen were among the wounded. The names were withheld pending notification of family members.\n\nThe wounded soldiers were evacuated for medical treatment.\n\nIslamic State militants have gained a foothold in recent years in Afghanistan, where they have battled U.S.-backed government forces as well as the more established Taliban.\n\nThe IS affiliate largely consists of disgruntled former Taliban insurgents, and has clashed with the larger group over leadership and ideology.\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide car bomber killed three civilians while trying to attack an Afghan army base in the southern Helmand province late on Wednesday.\n\nOmar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker and three other militants approached the base before guards opened fire on them, killing the three who were on foot. Three soldiers were wounded in the blast.\n\nIn southern Kandahar province, Taliban fighters stormed police checkpoints in two districts late on Wednesday, killing seven policemen and wounding nine, according to Zia Durani, spokesman for the provincial governor. He said 19 Taliban were killed in the ensuing clashes.\n\nAnd in southern Zabul province, the Taliban attacked a police base, killing eight policemen.\n\nA police official, Asif Tokhi, said the attack started on Wednesday night, along the Zabul-Kandahar highway, where the base is located.\n\nFighting there continued into the morning Thursday, he said. Along with the eight killed, three policemen were also wounded, and 12 Taliban fighters were also killed, Tokhi added.\n\nThe Taliban made no statements on the latest attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Taliban released an \"open letter\" to President Donald Trump, reiterating their calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after 16 years of war and warning against new U.S. military buildup in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump has so far resisted the Pentagon's recommendations to send almost 4,000 more to expand training of Afghan military forces and bolster U.S. counterterrorism operations. The deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize Afghanistan.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mirwais Khan in Kandahar, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Z\u0101bul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabul_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Z\u0101bul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47192"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47377"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47493"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47494"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Helmand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Helmand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47544"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231788"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317222", "label": {"eng": "Taliban insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322023", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "421291", "label": {"eng": "Durrani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "437893", "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1119395", "label": {"eng": "Tokhi"}}]}

to restore Islamic rule, have been waging an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001.\n\nIn the lengthy statement, the Taliban criticized the Afghan government as \"stooges\", \"lying corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sellouts\" who are providing Washington with overly optimistic \"rosy pictures\" of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realise!\" the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.\n\nThe statement also took aim at generals, who the Taliban said \"are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled\" soldiers.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said. \"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces.\n\nPowerful voices in the US government, including Republican Senator John McCain, have also called for an \"enduring\" US military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban letter concludes by saying the conflict could be resolved by the withdrawal of foreign troops.\n\n\"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,\" the Taliban said.\n\n\"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other

Either way, North Korea's Kim Jong Un may gain\n\nThe United States should withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan and stop listening to \"stooges\" in Kabul, the Taliban warned in an open letter to US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to finalise a regional strategy that could include nearly 4,000 additional US troops, part of a NATO-led coalition, that have been requested by commanders in the country. That plan has faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.\n\n\"Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,\" the Taliban said in the English-language letter released to media and addressed to Trump.\n\nThe Taliban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, have been waging an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001. In the lengthy statement, the Taliban criticized the Afghan government as \"stooges\", \"lying corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sellouts\" who are providing Washington with overly optimistic \"rosy pictures\" of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!\" the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties. The statement also took aim at generals, who the Taliban said \"are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled\" soldiers.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said. \"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces. Powerful voices in the US government, including Republican Senator John McCain, have also called for an \"enduring\" US military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban letter concludes by saying the conflict could be resolved by the withdrawal of foreign troops. \"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,\" the Taliban said. \"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.\"\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: donald trump Taliban", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "120"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65436"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302949", "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "312664", "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong-un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342305", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet\u2013Afghan_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1118979", "label": {"eng": "Soviet\u2013Afghan War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_interventions_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1395349", "label": {"eng": "Overseas interventions of the United States"}}]}

GEORGE - A 27-year-old Utah National Guard member from San Juan County was killed in Afghanistan Wednesday when a building he and his team were clearing exploded. The incident also left 11 others injured.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert confirmed Thursday during a press conference that a 12-member team of the Utah National Guard had been involved in an incident in a \"booby-trapped\" building that turned deadly for Aaron Butler, 27, of Monticello, Utah.\n\nWhile the governor did not release any names of the soldiers involved, Butler was subsequently identified as the soldier who had been killed. His family released the following statement Thursday:\n\nThe Army values are: 'Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless-Service, Honor, Integrity, Personal Courage'. Aaron Butler personified those values in everything he said and did. In a life that was all too brief, our dear son and brother made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. While we are heartbroken to become a Gold Star family, we honor Aaron's service and sacrifice. Aaron was a strength to us, an inspiration to those around him, and a joy to have in our family.\n\nEight members of the National Guard team are from Utah, Herbert said, while three are from other states. Each suffered \"various degrees of injury,\" the governor said.\n\n\"I will be calling and contacting the families today that have been involved in this incident to let them know of our concern and our support and our condolences. Certainly, it's a tragedy for them and a tragedy for all of us,\" Herbert said.\n\nAccording to the San Juan Record, Butler was a Special Forces Green Beret and graduated with honors from the qualification course in January 2016.\n\nA press release from the National Guard said Butler's team was in eastern Afghanistan and engaged in operations against ISIS groups in the region.\n\n\"My heart aches for the loss and sacrifice of our members and their families,\" Maj. Gen. Jefferson Burton, adjutant general of the Utah National Guard, said Wednesday. \"I know that what we do is dangerous and important work for our country's defense, but this realization does little to console me during times of loss such as this.\"\n\nThe San Jan County Commission also released a statement Thursday.\n\nYesterday, while on a mission in Afghanistan, Aaron Butler was killed by enemy forces.\n\nOur hearts are broken. We are devastated. Our prayers and support are sent to the Butler family at this sad time.\n\nWe will remember Aaron as a man that gave his life so that we may continue to live in the land of the free. His selfless service will not go unremembered or unthanked because we will remember and show gratitude to his family.\n\nWe also send our prayers to the other members of Aaron's unit that were wounded during the mission and wish them a speedy recovery.\n\nMay we never take our freedoms for granted or let a day go by without showing gratitude to the men and women who fight for our country.\n\nButler's body is being flown to Dover, Maryland, and will eventually be released to the family.\n\nMembers of Utah's Congressional delegation also expressed their condolences over social media.\n\nMy heart goes out to the family of the Guardsman we lost in Afghanistan. It's reminder that we live in a dangerous world.\n\n-- Rep. Chris Stewart (@RepChrisStewart) August 17, 2017\n\nBrave me & women and their families sacrifice every day to help protect us. On behalf of all you Utah's we are grateful for their sacrifice\n\n-- Rep.

Since then, Washington has spent $780 billion in Afghanistan, according to the National Priorities Project (NPP), in what has become its longest-running conflict, with no clear end in sight. Between 2001 and 2016, the Costs of War Project has estimated that around 173,000 civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan have been killed.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12949"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "303279", "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304453", "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305558", "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "306135", "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307190", "label": {"eng": "President of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "319668", "label": {"eng": "2003 invasion of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "326342", "label": {"eng": "Zabiullah Mujahid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mattis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "393413", "label": {"eng": "James Mattis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamir_Kabulov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "538245", "label": {"eng": "Zamir Kabulov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

In a life that was all too brief, our dear son and brother made the ultimate sacrifice for his country.\"\n\nThe family added: \"While we are heartbroken to become a gold star family, we honor Aaron's service and sacrifice. Aaron was a strength to us, an inspiration to those around him, and a joy to have in our family.\"\n\nButler was killed during an operation \"aimed at further reducing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Khorasan presence\" in Afghanistan, according to Stars & Stripes.\n\n\"Syria-Khorasan\" refers to the Central Asian Islamic State affiliate.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that Butler and 11 other Utah Army National Guard members were clearing a building alongside the Afghan army when the structure exploded.

Omar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the attacker was killed in the blast while three other militants on foot were shot dead when guards opened fire on them. He said the explosion also left three Afghan forces injured.\n\nSeven policemen were killed and nine were wounded in two similar attacks by the Taliban on police checkpoints in two districts of Kandahar, said Zia Durani, spokesman for the provincial governor, adding that 19 Taliban forces were killed in the ensuing clashes.\n\nAnother attack by the Taliban on a police base in Zabul province killed eight policemen. Asif Tokhi, a police official, said the base, located along the Zabul-Kandahar highway, came under attack late on Wednesday and security was restored only in the following morning. He said three policemen were also wounded in the clashes, which left 12 Taliban militants killed.\n\nThe Taliban have yet to claim the multiple attacks in the south while there has been no confirmation of the casualties among the ranks of the group.\n\nThe renewed attacks by the Taliban militants, which have also inflicted casualties on the US forces, come amid fresh warnings by the group about the need for the US to fully withdraw its forces from Afghanistan after more than a decade and half of occupation.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has resisted repeated requests by the Pentagon to approve the deployment of another 4,000-strong US force to Afghanistan, which the US military says is needed to boost the so-called counter-terrorism operations in the country.\n\nThere

If you'd like to learn more...\n\nThe Afghan Taliban on Tuesday released an \"open letter\" to President Donald Trump, reiterating their calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after 16 years of war.\n\nIn a long and rambling note in English that was sent to journalists by Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, the insurgents said Trump has recognized the errors of his predecessors by seeking a review of the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan.\n\nREAD MORE: 140 Afghan soldiers dead after Taliban disguised in army uniforms storm base\n\nHowever, Mujahid said Trump should not hand control of the U.S. Afghan policy to the military but rather announce the withdrawal of U.S. forces -- and not an increase in troops as the administration has planned.\n\nThe 1,600-word note said a U.S. withdrawal would \"truly deliver American troops from harm's way\" and bring about \"an end to an inherited war.\"\n\nThe U.S. now has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nWATCH: Obama announces 8,400 troops will stay in Afghanistan\n\nStory continues below\n\nTrump has so far resisted the Pentagon's recommendations to send almost 4,000 more to expand training of Afghan military forces and bolster U.S. counterterrorism operations. The deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is evident is that the Afghan government has struggled to halt Taliban advances on its own and is now also battling an Islamic State affiliate that has carved out a foothold mostly in eastern Afghanistan. In its most recent report, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said the Taliban hold sway in nearly 50 per cent of the country.\n\nThe Taliban letter sought to flatter Trump for initiating the Afghan policy review while warning against handing it to \"warmongering generals.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Russia must be confronted for arming the Taliban, says U.S. general in Afghanistan\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethinking your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" it said, addressing Trump.\n\n\"You must also not hand over the Afghan issue to warmongering generals, but must make a decision where history shall remember you as an advocate of peace.\"\n\nThe letter also offered a long list of complaints against Afghanistan's U.S.-orchestrated unity government and referenced a newly formed coalition of disgruntled warlords formed at a meeting last month in Turkey as an opposition bloc to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nWATCH: U.S. defence secretary says 'we are not winning in Afghanistan'\n\nGhani has been under pressure from critics who have described him as divisive and accused him of stoking ethnic rivalries.\n\nThe opposition bloc includes Uzbek warlord and Afghanistan's first vice-president, Rashid Dostum, who has been criticized by the U.S. for human rights abuses and is currently living in Turkey.

However we can't deny that from the economic point of view, the US and other NATO member states are bearing major expenses in our country.

In July, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said the Pentagon was close to completing its policy review for a new strategy in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The suggested increase of the US troops in Afghanistan should become a topic for discussion between the American and Afghan political analysts,\" Ruhollah Ahmadzai told Sputnik.\n\nHe further explained that if the US increases its contingent, it will be the repetition of the bloody events which happened 17 years ago and won't contribute to the fight against terrorism. What the US should really do, he said, is hold Pakistan accountable for its 22-year-long subversive activities in Afghanistan. It should study all the documental evidence of the UN and US intelligence services. Through intermediary of the US, all countries should condemn the criminal activities of Pakistan and isolate this country.\n\nWhen asked if the Taliban is able to overtake Afghanistan once again, the political analyst said that the military and political situation in the country is different from what it was 17 years ago,\n\n\"Our army has become better and stronger, our provinces become more secure.

But as far as the US army cannot do anything, let them leave Afghanistan. The American campaign in Afghanistan has failed. Afghanistan can become the world incubator of international terrorism.

The wounded were evacuated for treatment, the military said.\n\nThe slain servicemember was not identified, pending next of kin notifications, which the statement said was underway.\n\nThe operation was \"aimed at further reducing Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Khorasan presence\" in the country, the military said, referring to the Central Asian Islamic State affiliate also known as ISIS-K.\n\nU.S. forces, as part of a counterterrorism operation, have been assisting the Afghan government in efforts to defeat the group, which has maintained a foothold in eastern Afghan provinces near the border with Pakistan. ISIS-K has conducted several deadly attacks throughout the country this year.\n\nWednesday's death is the third U.S. combat fatality this month, following an attack on a NATO convoy in Kandahar province on Aug. 2 that killed two soldiers and wounded four others.\n\nThe military did not specify where the operation was being conducted Wednesday, beyond saying it was in eastern Afghanistan. At least six of the nine combat fatalities so far this year have occurred in eastern Nangarhar province, where troops have been battling ISIS-K in recent months.\n\nIn April, U.S. forces dropped the \"mother of all bombs\" - the largest conventional bomb ever deployed in combat - to destroy a series of Islamic State caves in a mountainous area in that province along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where sustained firefights with ISIS militants had taken place and just days after the first U.S. combat death of the year had occurred.\n\nThe U.S. has made it a priority to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan this year.\n\nEarlier this week, when the military announced that it had killed a senior leader in the group, Gen. John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in the country, said the U.S. \"will hunt them down until they are no longer a threat to the Afghan people and the region.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 163, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 287, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100, "id": 778, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47377"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Province", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47493"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302586"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-17", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "325361", "label": {"eng": "Mil Mi-17"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342305", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "373435", "label": {"eng": "Durand Line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "423496", "label": {"eng": "Provinces of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "446964", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_Blast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "763432", "label": {"eng": "GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast"}}]}

an open letter to President Donald Trump, reiterating their calls for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan after 16 years of war.\n\nIn a long and rambling note in English that was sent to journalists by Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, the insurgents said Mr Trump has recognised the errors of his predecessors by seeking a review of the US strategy for Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, Mujahid said Mr Trump should not hand control of the US Afghan policy to the military but rather announce the withdrawal of US forces - and not an increase in troops as the administration has planned.\n\nThe 1,600-word note said a US withdrawal would \"truly deliver American troops from harm's way\" and bring about \"an end to an inherited war\".\n\nThe United States now has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan.\n\nMr Trump has so far resisted the Pentagon's recommendations to send almost 4,000 more troops to expand training of Afghan military forces and bolster US counter-terrorism operations.\n\nThe deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilise Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is evident is that the Afghan government has struggled to halt Taliban advances on its own and is now also battling an Islamic State affiliate that has carved out a foothold mostly in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nIn its most recent report, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said the Taliban hold sway in nearly 50% of the country.\n\nThe Taliban letter sought to flatter Mr Trump for initiating the Afghan policy review while warning against handing it to \"warmongering generals\".\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethinking your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" it said, addressing Mr Trump.\n\n\"You must also not hand over the Afghan issue to warmongering generals, but must make a decision where history shall remember you as an advocate of peace.\"\n\nThe letter also offered a long list of complaints against Afghanistan's US-orchestrated unity government and referenced a newly formed coalition of disgruntled warlords formed at a meeting last month in Turkey as an opposition bloc to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nMr Ghani has been under pressure from critics who have described him as divisive and accused him of stoking ethnic rivalries.\n\nThe opposition bloc includes Uzbek warlord and Afghanistan's first vice president, Rashid Dostum, who has been criticised by the US for human rights abuses and is currently living in Turkey.\n\nAP", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri":

He added that Kabul has grown into a \"global incubator of international terrorism.\"\n\nMoscow does not see the need for further presence of the American contingent in Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, who is also the Russian Foreign Ministry's director of the Second Asian Department in Afghanistan, Izvestia reported.\n\n\"Moscow never hastened the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. But since the US Army campaign there has come to nothing, let them leave Afghanistan,\" Kabulov said.\n\n\"The American campaign in Afghanistan has failed. Afghanistan risks becoming a global incubator of international terrorism. It has, in fact, already partially grown to become it,\" Kabulov added.\n\nRussia strongly opposes the American idea to replace the regular US Army in Afghanistan with military contractors.\n\n\"The US is in despair, and plans to replace the professional armed forces with mercenaries are stupid. It will not lead to anything good: mercenaries will simply break into a run. They recruit them from around the world, offering cash. How are they going to fight against the Taliban?\" the diplomat wondered.\n\nThe US Department of Defense has spent more than $76 billion on weapons and equipment for the Afghan security forces since 2002, the US Government Accountability Office said last week.\n\nWashington has paid for 600,000 weapons, including rifles and pistols, for the Afghan Army and police, the GAO report, released on Thursday, said.\n\nThe key equipment provided included 163,000 tactical and non-tactical radios; 76,000 vehicles, such as Humvees; 30,000 equipment items for disposing of explosives, such as bomb disposal robots; and 16,000 equipment items for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, such as unmanned surveillance drones, just to name a handful.\n\nThe report came as President Donald Trump said he is \"very close\" to announcing a new strategy on Afghanistan.\n\n\"It's a very big decision for me,\" he told reporters in Bedminster on Thursday.\n\n\"I took over a mess,\" Trump said, \"and we're going to make it a lot less messy,\" he added.\n\nCalling the situation in Afghanistan a \"stalemate,\" Army General John Nicholson told the US Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year that while he has enough troops for counterterrorism operations against the likes of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and Islamic State, he would like several thousand more in order to boost the capabilities of the Afghan security forces.\n\nNicholson said troop injections could come from the US military or NATO nations.\n\n\"I have adequate resourcing in my counterterrorism mission,\" Nicholson said in February.\n\n\"But the train, advise and assist mission has a shortfall of a few thousand troops,\" he added, noting that the extra troops could come from the United States and its allies, many of whom are fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nNicholson said that offensive capability would eventually \"break the stalemate in Afghanistan,\" but it would also require an increase in troops stationed in Afghanistan in order to adequately train Afghan forces, Nicholson noted, specifically calling for increased funding for Afghanistan's air force.\n\nThe US has spent more than $780 billion in Afghanistan since 2001, according to the National Priorities Project (NPP), with the research tank saying that \"every hour, taxpayers in the United States are paying $4 million\" for the war in Afghanistan.\n\nFrom 2001 to mid-2016, around 173,000 civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan have died amid the American-led war, according to the Costs of War Project. More than 183,000 civilians have been seriously wounded in that time.\n\n\"We should leave Afghanistan immediately. No more wasted lives. If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick. Rebuild the US first,\" Trump tweeted in 2013.\n\nAbout 8,400 US troops and 6,400 NATO soldiers remain in Afghanistan following the large-scale NATO troop reduction in 2014.

The deployment has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is evident is that the Afghan government has struggled to halt Taliban advances on its own and is now also battling an Islamic State affiliate that has carved out a foothold mostly in eastern Afghanistan. In its most recent report, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said the Taliban hold sway in nearly 50 percent of the country.\n\nThe Taliban letter sought to flatter Trump for initiating the Afghan policy review while warning against handing it to \"warmongering generals.\"\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethinking your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" it said, addressing Trump. \"You must also not hand over the Afghan issue to warmongering generals, but must make a decision where history shall remember you as an advocate of peace.\"\n\nThe letter also offered a long list of complaints against Afghanistan's U.S.-orchestrated unity government and referenced a newly formed coalition of disgruntled warlords formed at a meeting last month in Turkey as an opposition bloc to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.\n\nGhani has been under pressure from critics who have described him as divisive and accused him of stoking ethnic rivalries.\n\nThe opposition bloc includes Uzbek warlord and Afghanistan's first vice president, Rashid Dostum, who has been criticized by the U.S. for human rights abuses and is currently living in Turkey. Atta Mohammed Noor, a Tajik warlord and governor of northern Balkh province and Mohammed Mohaqiq, an ethnic Hazara lawmaker are also in the bloc.\n\nTags: newswires associated press world newswires Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "48650"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304922", "label": {"eng": "Warlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314543", "label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322023", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbeks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323214", "label": {"eng": "Uzbeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "326342", "label": {"eng": "Zabiullah Mujahid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342305", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani_Ahmadzai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "349603", "label": {"eng": "Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "384893", "label": {"eng": "President of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "437893", "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Inspector_General_for_Afghanistan_Reconstruction", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "487820", "label": {"eng": "Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rashid_Dostum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "500069", "label": {"eng": "Abdul Rashid Dostum"}}]}

disciplined U.S. and NATO troops, advanced technology, experienced military generals, consecutive strategies and mighty economy, you shall never be able to win it with mercenaries, notorious

military invasions and suggests he become a president of peace rather than war.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethinking your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter stated. \"You must also not handover the Afghan issue to warmongering generals but must make a decision where history shall remember you as an advocate of peace.\"\n\nAccording to Voice of America, the letter also alleged that U.S. generals are \"concealing\" American casualty numbers in Afghanistan.\n\nThe letter was released to media outlets as the Trump administration gets ready to announce its new strategy for Afghanistan, where the U.S. military has been at war since 2001.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis said Trump was \"very, very close\" to making a decision, but noted \"strategic decisions have not been made.\"\n\nAccording to icasualties.org, which tracks American and allied soldier deaths in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, there have been 2,402 U.S. soldier deaths, 451 British troop deaths and 3,538 soldier deaths from other countries, mostly Afghanistan.\n\nAs of August 2016, there have been more than 31,000 civilian

After nearly 16 years of war, the country is torn by violence and the government of President Ashraf Ghani remains weak. Taliban fighters are surging in a number of rural areas. Mr. Trump is right to ask whether a longer and deeper commitment of U.S. forces, proposed by the commanders on the ground and his national security adviser, would be wasted. He is also correct to believe there can be no strictly military victory. But when Mr. Trump weighs a long-overdue strategic plan for Afghanistan, perhaps as soon as Friday, we hope he will also see there are very real risks to conceding defeat. The United States should not abandon Afghanistan now.\n\nMr. Trump initially empowered Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to decide troop levels in Afghanistan and their objectives. The secretary has told Congress that the Taliban now controls or contests some 40 percent of Afghanistan, and that more U.S. troops and NATO forces would help block the militants' momentum. As an interim step, American commanders in the country requested some 3,000 to 5,000 additional U.S. troops, but Mr. Mattis delayed sending them. The deployment question has become part of a long internal policy debate in which Mr. Trump seems caught between two arguments.\n\nSome \"America first\" political advisers are telling him that adding troops is just a recipe for failed nation-building. They appeal to Mr. Trump's visceral aversion to entanglements abroad, and an angry president reportedly suggested firing the current U.S. commander in Afghanistan at a recent meeting at the White House. But Mr. Trump is also hearing from the retired generals he has entrusted with key national security positions -- including Mr. Mattis and White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster -- that it would be a mistake to withdraw from Afghanistan completely.\n\nHe should listen to the generals. It is not an easy choice, but the goal of any strategy must be to build Afghan stability, not weaken it. Mr. Ghani's government is fractured and facing popular discontent. Afghan security forces are losing ground. A U.S. pullout would accelerate the centrifugal forces already at work. Although Afghanistan has come far over the past decade and a half, a sudden withdrawal might send it spiraling downward toward the chaos of the 1990s, when it became a sanctuary for al-Qaeda and home base for the Taliban's harsh form of Islamic rule. This time, it could become a base for the Islamic State, as well.\n\nMr. Trump should chose a strategy with a clear, limited goal: shore up the Afghan government, help it gain greater legitimacy and strengthen its security forces. The point is not some kind of flashy victory but avoiding a terrible defeat. Achieving stability in Afghanistan is worth a modest commitment of U.S. troops, Special Operations forces and air power. A major surge of the size that President Barack Obama approved early in his first term is not being discussed. The point is to show the Taliban that it can't topple the central government, and coax the Taliban, if possible, toward negotiations. Maybe the Taliban will never agree, but a continued U.S. effort is preferable to Afghanistan falling apart.\n\nRead more here:\n\nThe Post's View: How Trump can make progress in America's longest conflict\n\nThe Post's View: Trump is right to leave Afghanistan troop levels up to the Pentagon\n\nRonald E.

That is being perpetrated by members of the Taliban.\"\n\n\"Let's not lose focus that the Taliban is behind many of those attacks, many of the increase in civilian casualties,\" she said, adding that \"that undermines the Afghan population and also the Afghan government.\"\n\n(The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported last month that the rise in casualties among Afghan women in the Jan. 1- Jun. 30 period was up 23 percent over the same period last year, while the number of child deaths was up nine percent.)\n\n'The errors of your predecessors'\n\nIn its lengthy open letter to Trump Tuesday, the Taliban argued that the 16-year-long war was going nowhere, that the situation in the country was \"far worse than you realize,\" and that young Americans were being sacrificed in a campaign to impose \"incompetent, corrupt, immoral and criminal officials\" upon Afghan citizens.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said, urging Trump not to follow the advice of \"warmongering congressmen and generals.\"\n\n\"American youth are not born to be killed in the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan in order to establish the writ of thieves and corrupt officials,\" it said. \"Rather you and American officials have the grave responsibility of protecting the lives of American youth which is your indispensable human resource.\"\n\nThe Taliban characterized itself as a group with no foreign sponsors and with no intention of allowing Afghan soil to be used by any group to cause harm to others.\n\n\"Your intelligence agencies admit that our mujahideen [holy warriors] are not being supported by any country and neither can they produce any proof in the contrary,\" it said.\n\n\"[T]he Islamic Emirate does not have any intention or policy of causing harm to anyone and neither will it allow others to use the Afghan soil against anyone.\"\n\nThe U.S. went into Afghanistan in the first place in late 2001 because the Taliban, which then controlled most of the country, had provided a haven for Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda as it planned and carried out the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Taliban/al-Qaeda links and collaboration have continued over the years since.\n\nAnd despite the Taliban's claims to the contrary, the U.S. government has accused official elements in Pakistan and Iran of supporting the group.\n\n\"Afghan-oriented militant groups, including the Taliban and Haqqani Network, retain freedom of action inside Pakistani territory and benefit from support from elements of the Pakistani government,\" the Pentagon said in a report to Congress last June.\n\nThe following month, the State Department's annual country reports on terrorism stated that a number of attacks by the Taliban and other groups in 2016 \"were planned and launched from safe havens in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe terrorist group's open letter to the president came at a time when a White House decision on the road ahead for Afghanistan is expected at any time, and a day after Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters that \"all options\" - including a troop withdrawal - were on the table.\n\nMattis said Trump was \"open to\" his advice as well as that of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and CIA Director Mike Pompeo about what to do in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The strategic decisions have not been decided, but we're very close.\"\n\nOther options referred to by Mattis include the use of more private security contractors.\n\nThe U.S. currently has more than 8,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led mission to \"train, advise and assist\" Afghan forces, Personnel are also conducting counterterrorism operations actions against the Taliban and other groups. Earlier reports suggested an additional 3,000-5,000 troops could be deployed.\n\n\"We're sharpening each one of the options [being provided to the president], so you can see the pluses and minuses of each one,\" Mattis said.\n\nAsked Tuesday whether a troop withdrawal was an option, Nauert said it was \"not my place to talk about that whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I know there are a lot of various options on the table that the U.S. government is considering as it reviews its Afghan policy,\" she said. \"They will be considering a lot of different options and would never rule out any - absolutely everything.\"\n\nTrump said last Thursday a decision on Afghanistan was \"very close.\"\n\n\"I took over a mess,\" he told reporters in Bedminster, N.J. \"And we're going to make it a lot less messy.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303299", "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303326", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303510", "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "306057", "label": {"eng": "Osama bin Laden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "307351", "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314543", "label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342305", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haqqani_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "353087", "label": {"eng": "Haqqani network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "372227", "label": {"eng": "Mike Pompeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mattis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "393413", "label": {"eng": "James Mattis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_in_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "422137", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "532783", "label": {"eng": "Rex Tillerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Nauert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "905802", "label": {"eng": "Heather Nauert"}}]}

In it, the group said that the U.S.'s campaign to stabilize the war-torn Asian nation was in vain, despite \"spending billions of dollars, sacrificing thousands of soldiers and losing tens of thousands to injuries and mental illness.\"\n\nThe militants maintained that their interests were merely national, despite their links to global jihadi group Al-Qaeda, and urged Trump to reverse his predecessors' policies, which the Taliban said only further destabilized the country.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nRelated: We have lost the war in Afghanistan.

WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe letter also referenced prior U.S. support for the mujahedeen, a loose coalition of armed opposition groups that overthrew the Soviet-backed communist government of Afghanistan in 1992. A number of these organizations went on to found the Islamic State of Afghanistan, while others ultimately established the Taliban, which overthrew the government to form the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in 1996. War between factions continued through 2001.\n\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks, Afghanistan's Taliban leadership refused to extradite Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden to the U.S., prompting a mass invasion of the country. U.S.-led NATO forces have been struggling to defeat the militants ever since, in what is the longest war in U.S. history.\n\nRussia says it's a staunch opponent of the Taliban, but it also has strongly denounced the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union withdrew from the country in 1989 after fighting the U.S.-backed mujahedeen, but reports suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin's government may have established diplomatic channels with the militants and possibly even armed them in anticipation that they would ultimately play a greater role in Afghanistan's future.\n\nPutin's special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, criticized the U.S. for destabilizing Afghanistan, which he called an \"incubator for international terrorism.\" He also decried potential U.S. plans to replace soldiers with private armies, which he referred to as \"mercenaries.\"\n\n\"Since the U.S. Army is unable to do anything serious, let it leave Afghanistan,\" Kabulov told Moscow-based daily Izvestia in remarks translated by China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.\n\n\"The Americans are in despair, and their plans to replace professional military men with mercenaries are foolish. It will not lead to anything good, and mercenaries will simply escape. They recruit them for money from around the world. How are they going to fight against the Taliban in general?\" Kabulov added, according to the Communist Party's Pravda newspaper.\n\nVeterans lay flowers at the monument for the dead in the Soviet war in Afghanistan during a memorial ceremony in Kiev, Ukraine, on February 15. The decade-long conflict killed nearly 15,000 Soviet troops, tens of thousands more Russia-backed forces and their U.S.-backed mujahedeen foes, and hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians. It has been compared to the U.S.'s experience in Vietnam. SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Taliban often fashions itself as a local, nationalist movement, but it is a key Al-Qaeda ally. Taliban fighters often clash with a competing hard-line Sunni organization, the Islamic State militant group (ISIS), but local Afghan officials say the two have worked together recently, with deadly results. Militants from both groups joined forces last week to slaughter up to 50 men, women and children in the Sayad district of Afghanistan's northern Sar-e-Pul province. Mujahedeen denied that the Taliban worked with ISIS or that it killed civilians.\n\nArmy General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, has requested additional troops to train, advise and assist local forces fighting both ISIS and the Taliban. But some officials, including Trump himself, have questioned U.S. goals in the country. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Monday that the government was \"very, very close\" to making a decision on the war in Afghanistan, according to Reuters.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories":

Or he could try to shift the burden so that more of it falls on private security contractors. Or he could authorize something like a gradual withdrawal -- or cut bait entirely.\n\nNone of those choices would bring victory or end the conflict and each one has its downsides. As the summer wears on, however, observers worry that whatever the Trump administration decides, it's taking too long.\n\n\"It is doing just what it should not do,\" wrote defense scholar Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It is letting the situation steadily deteriorate and is losing by negligence and default.\"\n\nThe problem is not new: Afghanistan is a house that can only stand if the United States remains in the corner holding up the roof.\n\nIts government cannot afford the military and security infrastructure built by Washington and other international donors. The Afghan military and police cannot hold their own against the Taliban and other insurgents they've been battling for nearly two decades. Billions of dollars of international aid have been squandered.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community assessed years ago that if or when the United States withdrew its support, the Afghan government would likely collapse. The question is how badly and how quickly.\n\nTop American commanders say the conflict is in \"stalemate;\" Trump is said to have complained that the U.S. is \"losing.\"\n\nA new troop deployment could keep the war on a low boil but preserve the status quo or even claw back some previous security gains -- at greater risk to the larger population of American troops and the increased costs associated with a larger troop presence.\n\nSwitching to larger numbers of military contractors could usher in an unprecedented new era in which Washington more or less privatized a major arena of national security policy. That might pose fewer risks to American troops, but it would likely still be expensive and certainly still dangerous for the mercenaries who took over.\n\nA withdrawal is the least certain, and potentially most dramatic, of all the options said to be under consideration. The devil, as ever, would be in the details.\n\nPresident Barack Obama wanted to reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan to just a standard embassy detachment, but he had to backtrack from that plan toward the end of his tenure when it became clear that the dangers were too great from the Taliban and terrorist forces.\n\nMattis and Pentagon leaders appear to continue to hold that view, as may national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. They have pushed to deploy nearly 4,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan earlier this year to join the current force of about 8,500 in helping train the indigenous forces and fight insurgents and terrorists.\n\nTrump and his top political advisers, however, are said to question whether the status quo is worth preserving if it won't bring the war any closer to a satisfactory end. The United States couldn't set the Afghan government up to succeed and defeat its enemies with 100,000 troops under Obama, so a much smaller bump would almost certainly not be decisive.\n\nTrump has been described as bitterly frustrated with the war and his options, to the point where he has aired firing the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson. The general so far remains in his job but the White House also has delayed rolling out a new strategy for Afghanistan that was expected early this summer, which was supposed to outline the mission for any additional troops.\n\nMattis said this week that Nicholson \"is our commander in the field, he has the confidence of NATO, he has the confidence of Afghanistan, he has the confidence of the United States.\"\n\nBut there are more signs that Trump is fed up with the generals. He even hosted a group of lower-ranking service members at the White House in July to ask them for their take on what he should do.\n\n\"We're going to be getting some ideas because we've been there -- it's our longest war -- we've been there for many years ... and I want to find out why,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not disclose what advice the troops gave the president, but Trump and his advisers are said to look hard at this bottom line: If Afghanistan is unwinnable, why prolong the danger to American forces and the cost associated with deploying them?\n\nWhy not just rip off the Band-Aid?\n\nSimply deciding to do so would not be enough, however. The White House would need to determine how to achieve its ends.\n\nTrump could let Afghanistan down easy: preserve financial support for the government in Kabul, ask to keep some American warplanes and drones in key bases and continue targeting the most dangerous terror groups -- but get most U.S. troops out.\n\nSupporters of a withdrawal make the case that dialing down American support for Afghanistan effectively imposes costs on nearby Iran, China and Russia. That could be worth doing for its own sake, in this view -- \"forcing the countries that do have major strategic interests in the region to take on the burden or live with the consequences,\" as CSIS's Cordesman wrote.\n\nThe Afghan government might have a great deal to say about all this. And it might not agree to permit U.S. forces to keep access to only the bases that Washington wants if American troops are withdrawing from everywhere else.\n\nIf that means a breach with Kabul and full-scale \"retrograde,\" as military planners would say, it would start the clock on a dark new era for Afghanistan. Taliban and terrorist insurgents would press their gains across the country and put intense new pressure on the more populated areas controlled by the central government.\n\nBut the terrorism threat is different in 2017 from 2001, when the U.S. invaded. Extremist groups have proliferated in the Middle East and North Africa, but they are divided and U.S. national security officials say they're less capable of launching a major attack.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan told an audience at the Aspen Security Forum that although homegrown extremists or small-scale attacks remain dangerous, he believes the U.S. and its allies could disrupt or prevent something as large as another Sept. 11 plot.\n\nOr so the U.S. and Western governments might hope. In terms of terrorism, abandoning Afghanistan might amount to a roll of the dice.\n\nSeparate from the geopolitical and security implications, the biggest consideration for Trump and his advisers are the politics. How much do Americans care?\n\nIf the old conventional wisdom was that a president didn't want to \"lose\" Afghanistan in the way that the U.S. \"lost\" Vietnam -- or the way critics blamed Obama for the rise of the Islamic State after the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in 2011 -- does that still apply?\n\nMost Americans are disconnected from the war in Afghanistan. Only a small minority have served there or know someone who has. And even though U.S. casualties do continue -- 10 service members have been killed in Afghanistan so far this year -- the war keeps well off the front page and almost never get onto TV. Obama himself claimed to have \"ended\" combat in Afghanistan.\n\nSo the question for Trump is whether he would pay any political price for pulling the plug on a conflict that many Americans already ignore, or whether the risks from a crumbling Afghanistan would be so great it's wiser to keep the war going behind the scenes.\n\nMattis told reporters the research and analysis behind the menu of choices for Trump is complete. What remains, he said, is for the president to pick.\n\n\"We're sharpening each one of the options so you can see the pluses and minuses of each one, so that there's no longer any new data you're going to get,\" Mattis said. \"Now just make the decision.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47494"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "302950", "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303634", "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305998", "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "307351", "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322023", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348336", "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mattis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "393413", "label": {"eng": "James Mattis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Cordesman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "398169", "label": {"eng": "Anthony Cordesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._McMaster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "917917", "label": {"eng": "H.

Or he could try to shift the burden so that more of it falls on private security contractors. Or he could authorize something like a gradual withdrawal -- or cut bait entirely.\n\nNone of those choices would bring victory or end the conflict and each one has its downsides. As the summer wears on, however, observers worry that whatever the Trump administration decides, it's taking too long.\n\n\"It is doing just what it should not do,\" wrote defense scholar Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It is letting the situation steadily deteriorate and is losing by negligence and default.\"\n\nThe problem is not new: Afghanistan is a house that can only stand if the United States remains in the corner holding up the roof.\n\nIts government cannot afford the military and security infrastructure built by Washington and other international donors. The Afghan military and police cannot hold their own against the Taliban and other insurgents they've been battling for nearly two decades. Billions of dollars of international aid have been squandered.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community assessed years ago that if or when the United States withdrew its support, the Afghan government would likely collapse. The question is how badly and how quickly.\n\nTop American commanders say the conflict is in \"stalemate;\" Trump is said to have complained that the U.S. is \"losing.\"\n\nA new troop deployment could keep the war on a low boil but preserve the status quo or even claw back some previous security gains -- at greater risk to the larger population of American troops and the increased costs associated with a larger troop presence.\n\nSwitching to larger numbers of military contractors could usher in an unprecedented new era in which Washington more or less privatized a major arena of national security policy. That might pose fewer risks to American troops, but it would likely still be expensive and certainly still dangerous for the mercenaries who took over.\n\nA withdrawal is the least certain, and potentially most dramatic, of all the options said to be under consideration. The devil, as ever, would be in the details.\n\nPresident Barack Obama wanted to reduce the American military presence in Afghanistan to just a standard embassy detachment, but he had to backtrack from that plan toward the end of his tenure when it became clear that the dangers were too great from the Taliban and terrorist forces.\n\nMattis and Pentagon leaders appear to continue to hold that view, as may national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. They have pushed to deploy nearly 4,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan earlier this year to join the current force of about 8,500 in helping train the indigenous forces and fight insurgents and terrorists.\n\nTrump and his top political advisers, however, are said to question whether the status quo is worth preserving if it won't bring the war any closer to a satisfactory end. The United States couldn't set the Afghan government up to succeed and defeat its enemies with 100,000 troops under Obama, so a much smaller bump would almost certainly not be decisive.\n\nTrump has been described as bitterly frustrated with the war and his options, to the point where he has aired firing the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson. The general so far remains in his job but the White House also has delayed rolling out a new strategy for Afghanistan that was expected early this summer, which was supposed to outline the mission for any additional troops.\n\nMattis said this week that Nicholson \"is our commander in the field, he has the confidence of NATO, he has the confidence of Afghanistan, he has the confidence of the United States.\"\n\nBut there are more signs that Trump is fed up with the generals. He even hosted a group of lower-ranking service members at the White House in July to ask them for their take on what he should do.\n\n\"We're going to be getting some ideas because we've been there -- it's our longest war -- we've been there for many years ... and I want to find out why,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not disclose what advice the troops gave the president, but Trump and his advisers are said to look hard at this bottom line: If Afghanistan is unwinnable, why prolong the danger to American forces and the cost associated with deploying them?\n\nWhy not just rip off the Band-Aid?\n\nSimply deciding to do so would not be enough, however. The White House would need to determine how to achieve its ends.\n\nTrump could let Afghanistan down easy: preserve financial support for the government in Kabul, ask to keep some American warplanes and drones in key bases and continue targeting the most dangerous terror groups -- but get most U.S. troops out.\n\nSupporters of a withdrawal make the case that dialing down American support for Afghanistan effectively imposes costs on nearby Iran, China and Russia. That could be worth doing for its own sake, in this view -- \"forcing the countries that do have major strategic interests in the region to take on the burden or live with the consequences,\" as CSIS's Cordesman wrote.\n\nThe Afghan government might have a great deal to say about all this. And it might not agree to permit U.S. forces to keep access to only the bases that Washington wants if American troops are withdrawing from everywhere else.\n\nIf that means a breach with Kabul and full-scale \"retrograde,\" as military planners would say, it would start the clock on a dark new era for Afghanistan. Taliban and terrorist insurgents would press their gains across the country and put intense new pressure on the more populated areas controlled by the central government.\n\nBut the terrorism threat is different in 2017 from 2001, when the U.S. invaded. Extremist groups have proliferated in the Middle East and North Africa, but they are divided and U.S. national security officials say they're less capable of launching a major attack.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan told an audience at the Aspen Security Forum that although homegrown extremists or small-scale attacks remain dangerous, he believes the U.S. and its allies could disrupt or prevent something as large as another Sept. 11 plot.\n\nOr so the U.S. and Western governments might hope. In terms of terrorism, abandoning Afghanistan might amount to a roll of the dice.\n\nSeparate from the geopolitical and security implications, the biggest consideration for Trump and his advisers are the politics. How much do Americans care?\n\nIf the old conventional wisdom was that a president didn't want to \"lose\" Afghanistan in the way that the U.S. \"lost\" Vietnam -- or the way critics blamed Obama for the rise of the Islamic State after the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in 2011 -- does that still apply?\n\nMost Americans are disconnected from the war in Afghanistan.

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nDANGEROUS JOB\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an U.S. military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the center of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nMORE ADVISERS NEED MORE PROTECTION\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfill about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\"\n\nThe troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107,

But tensions in the White House have made it hard to settle on a war strategy. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nRobert Robb: After 16 years, $700 billion and 22,000 casualties, it's time to let Afghanistan find its own course.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe Pentagon is reportedly having trouble convincing President Donald Trump to increase troop levels in Afghanistan. A promised new Afghanistan strategy has been delayed.\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain has stepped into the breach. He has drafted his own Afghanistan strategy that he plans to offer as an amendment to the defense funding authorization bill, soon to be considered by the U.S. Senate.\n\nThis is, at best, a borderline constitutionally appropriate move. The Constitution is clear that, whereas Congress authorizes war, the president decides how to conduct it.\n\nMcCain has framed his strategy as an expression of the sense of Congress. So, it wouldn't purport to be binding. But it still has at least the flavor of a usurpation of the president's prerogative as commander in chief.\n\nMcCain wants more troops and more aid\n\nNevertheless, the McCain Afghanistan strategy would be worth examination by Trump. It's a more candid explication of the road to a deeper and even longer engagement in the country than he is likely to get from the military brass' incrementalist proposals. It should stiffen Trump's skepticism about heading down that road.\n\nMcCain would vigorously contest this characterization, but his strategy is basically to return Afghanistan to an American protectorate.\n\nMORE: House weighs plan to privatize war in Afghanistan\n\nMore American troops would be sent. American soldiers would be embedded again with Afghanistan combat troops. U.S. air cover would be substantially increased.\n\nU.S. aid to Afghanistan would be boosted. It would be tied to Afghanistan hitting benchmarks on good governance, such as cracking down on corruption, agreed to with the U.S. government.\n\nMcCain's amendment doesn't specify how many additional troops would be required, how much it would cost, or how long the American protectorate would last.\n\nHis approach will be slow and costly\n\nBut the McCain strategy can't be implemented on the cheap or quickly bring success. Unlike other neoconservative hawks, McCain, to his credit, has always been candid about this.\n\nIn 2009, in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute about how to win the Afghanistan war, McCain said: \"The scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous, and the timetable will be measured in years, not months.\"\n\nHis amendment calls for \"an enduring United States counterterrorism presence in Afghanistan\" and \"providing sustained support to the Afghan National Security and Defense Forces.\"\n\nNow, it is true that the United States has never committed to the level of involvement in Afghanistan McCain supports. So, it cannot be said that his approach has been tried and failed.\n\nBut what we have committed, and the results produced, raises grave doubts that doing even more will produce security gains for the United States commensurate with the massive investment required.\n\nWe've spent a lot with little to show for it\n\nThe United States toppled the Taliban with minimal effort and expense. Basically, we just tipped the balance in a pre-existing low-grade civil war against it. There was no U.S. ground invasion. We mostly just provided the opposition some money and intelligence.\n\nWe have since spent a fortune trying to keep the Taliban from coming back and to establish a functioning Afghanistan government, without much to show for it.\n\nTotal expenditures in Afghanistan have been more than $700 billion. Of that, nearly $70 billion has gone to Afghan security forces and another $45 billion for various humanitarian and reconstruction projects.\n\nThe toll has been more than money. Over 2,000 U.S. soldiers have been killed in the war, and nearly 20,000 wounded.\n\nPrevention isn't worth the cure\n\nDespite all that, Afghanistan is a mess. The writ of the government extends to maybe 60 percent of the country. Transparency International ranks Afghanistan as the seventh most corrupt country in the world. The World Bank ranks it near the bottom in the ease of doing business.\n\nAfter 16 years, over $700 billion, and some 22,000 casualties, it's time to let Afghanistan find its own course.\n\nIf some jihadist safe zones that threaten the United States emerge, we can take targeted action to nullify the threat, as we did to initially chase out the Taliban.\n\nIn this case, an ounce of prevention, in terms of keeping the Taliban at bay, isn't worth a pound of cure.

suffered on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. service member was wounded during a partnered operation with U.S. and Afghan Forces in Eastern Afghanistan aimed at reducing the extremist group Islamic State's presence in Afghanistan, according to a Pentagon statement.\n\nThe casualty comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is mulling over increasing U.S. troops there.\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama had planned to reduce the current number of 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan to some 5,500 by the end of 2015 and withdraw all troops by the end of 2016 when his presidency came to an end.\n\nHowever, given the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, the Obama administration repeatedly postponed the withdrawal.\n\nCurrently, there are about 8,400 U.S. troops and another 5,000 forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on the ground in Afghanistan to train and assist the Afghan forces against the Taliban, and conduct counter-terrorism missions.\n\nThe new casualty also comes at a time when senior U.S. officials warned of a dire security situation in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a congressional hearing in June, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that the United States was still \"not winning\" the longest war in U.S. history in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. National Intelligence Director Dan Coats also warned in May that the security situation in Afghanistan would most likely deteriorate in the future even if the United States and its allies offer more military aid.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id":

All but one resulted from hostile enemy action, according to Defense Department data. It comes, too, as America's longest war nears the start of its 17th year, and the Trump administration remains without a clear strategy.\n\nThe ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, a group known as ISIS Khorasan, or ISIS-K, is entrenched along the county's mountainous border. Backed by U.S. troops and firepower, Afghan commando units have aggressively pursued its fighters for many months and shown some progress in disrupting their activity.\n\nAmerican and Afghan troops launched Operation Hamza in early March. The following month, U.S. forces carried out a massive airstrike on an ISIS tunnel complex in Nangarhar's Achin district, killing upward of 100 militants. At the time, U.S. officials estimated that between 400 and 700 ISIS-K militants remained in Afghanistan.\n\nISIS-K is an offshoot of the terror group's core network in Iraq and Syria, receiving tactical guidance and financial support from outside Afghanistan but few additional fighters.\n\nAbout 14,000 U.S. and NATO troops remain in Afghanistan.

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nNew US strategy for Afghanistan\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before US President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nAfghanistan's plans to fly shipments to India bypassing Pakistan go awry\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an US military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the center of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the US military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the US military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nIslamabad tells Kabul it's willing to go an extra mile\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfill about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\"\n\nThe troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.", "date":

Some of the troops quietly wept.\n\nFew details about the blast were available, including a firm number of U.S. wounded or the name of the soldier who was killed. One U.S. official said most of the injured American troops had already been released from medical care.\n\nTwo officials said the U.S. and Afghan forces were hit by an explosion inside a building in Nangarhar. They did not say what caused the explosion.\n\nFor Wilson, a former congresswoman who took over the Air Force's top civilian job three months ago, the ceremony was an unexpected part of her reintroduction to the Afghan war.\n\nWith the latest death, 10 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year, according to the U.S. military. Nearly 2,400 American troops have been killed since the war began in response to al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\n\nThe incident was a reminder of the high stakes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers requests from the top commander in Afghanistan for thousands more troops beyond the roughly 8,400 who are already here.\n\nThe goal would be to help Afghan forces break a stalemate against Taliban insurgents and, at the same time, prevent rival Islamic State fighters from expanding here as their territory shrinks in Syria and Iraq.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.\n\nTrump, Vice President Mike Pence and his national security team are scheduled to discuss Afghan war strategy and regional policy guiding it at a meeting at Camp David on Friday.\n\nWilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein declined to wade into the policy debate about Afghanistan.

The letter suggests the US president should adopt a 'strategy of complete withdrawal from Afghanistan instead of a troop surge'. What does this mean for future of Afghanistan? Will the Trump administration heed the Taliban's suggestion? In the overall cost-benefit analysis of this long fought stalemated war, I think it should.\n\nThe big question that has been asked by the strategists for over a decade and a half now is -- what would yield a stable Afghanistan? Post-9/11 the stability of the world has been associated with the stability of Afghanistan -- billions of dollars have been spent in a stalemated warfare there to convert it into a stable and peaceful state that may eventually become inhospitable to terrorists.\n\nThe attainment of this goal has so far eluded the Americans and their many military and political strategists who tried their luck unsuccessfully -- the latest to that list now would be the Trump administration which is soon going to reveal and unfold its new Afghan policy. How different would it be from the one proffered by Obama, Bush or Clinton?\n\nPresident Obama's administration went all out to execute a deep surge strategy in Afghanistan thus raising the cost of the Afghan war there by spending $100 billion a year on maintaining a troop surge of over 100,000. Two of America's best generals -- General Stanley McChrystal and General David Petraeus -- executed the best possible military doctrine that could be executed in an irregular warfare implementing counterinsurgency operations and through it focused on 'winning hearts and minds' in a political and military strategy that had a clear and an unambiguous aim of 'clearing, holding and building' Afghanistan. But the efforts proved insufficient to turn the tide.\n\nSeen in hindsight the United States employed counterterrorism as its core strategy in Afghanistan -- executing air strikes, special operations raids which didn't have a lasting impact. The counterinsurgency strategy was only introduced and implemented in 2010. Even the US presence in the Taliban stronghold districts like Helmand and Kandahar was negligible and these districts were secured with military presence only after the beginning of the counterinsurgency operations in 2010.\n\nOne of the fatal mistakes made in Afghanistan has been the American assumption that only military actions will contribute to an overall strategic win. Military actions, as is historically proven, only create suitable conditions and an environment for a political solution. Was not initiating 'political activism' more important than conducting military operations in Afghanistan? It seems that American political and military strategy in Afghanistan has been marred by a lack of ability to define a priority -- was it good governance or was it defeating the Taliban? Or, was it both with the result that in the end America ended up achieving neither. If it was assumed that good governance will follow Taliban's defeat than neither have the Taliban been defeated nor has the governance in Afghanistan improved. Today as the Trump administration's new policy in Afghanistan is eagerly awaited one thing seems certain -- Afghanistan may slide back into a full-scale civil war if Washington stops providing serious and sustainable help to it.\n\nSince the time they have been ousted from the government, the Taliban have been fighting a violent war with the aim of seeking back, if not all than some, share of power in Afghanistan. Had the early American intention been to seek a deal with Taliban's rather than try to drone and bomb their leadership to defeat the political and strategic environment in Afghan war today may have been entirely different.\n\nFighting a guerrilla war, the Taliban always had time on their side. Witnessing the lack of American willingness to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and the continuity of American military goal of obliterating the Taliban leadership through drone strikes the Taliban preferred to wait out the Americans rather than concede to the their offers of dialogue that they considered non serious.\n\nAt the height of the troop surge and with the military presence that the Americans maintained in Afghanistan pushing out the terrorists should not have been their most sought after goal -- 'getting rid of the bad guys and the post-war peace will take care of itself' was an American assumption that never materialised.\n\nUtilising the space and time to build up a corruption-free and legitimate Afghan government could have been the other important goal. Ignoring the making and creation of a political state of Afghanistan was a mistake. Improving civil services, Afghan justice system, doing everything to allow the rule of law to take root by improving the political system and making the executive accountable were very much achievable targets. Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai was considered by many as nothing more than a mayor of Kabul yet the Americans did little to change this equation and do anything to extend his authority. Max Boot, who is a senior fellow for national security studies at the Council of Foreign Relations, made a very sound observation when writing a piece for Foreign Affairs magazine (Nov/Dec 2014) -- 'More Small Wars -- Counterinsurgency is here to stay', he mentioned that the 'State Department and other government agencies could never provide enough skilled personnel in Afghanistan in such areas as governance and economic development to complement the military's efforts; soldiers wound up filling many of the jobs.'\n\nIn hindsight when one looks at the amount of money that the Americans spent and poured into Afghanistan, it is not only the Americans who failed but actually the Afghans themselves as well. Lack of national reconciliation and lack of effective government only added to the choices that many tribes in Afghanistan made to side with the nongovernmental actors such as the Taliban rather than siding with an unpopular, non-delivering and dysfunctional government. If the Americans wanted to project themselves as the protectors of the Afghan society, the people of Afghanistan never accepted that and when the Afghan government like the one of Karzai was as corrupt as it was Afghans only looked at Americans as supporting a government that was corrupt and not people-friendly. Afghanistan didn't need just military action it needed huge Afghan governmental strides in social, political and economic reform -- that never came.\n\nShowcasing a well-financed and well-resourced 'winning political and military plan' why did America fail in Afghanistan?\n\nA large part of the American excuse for this failure is put on Pakistan's shoulders. The US describes the Afghan insurgency as made in Pakistan. In the 'slow motion version' of its defeat that the world has witnessed, Pakistan also had a share of its losses and contrary to how the world looks at the violence being exported from Pakistan to Afghanistan -- instead violence in its worst forms has continuously visited and entered Pakistan from the Afghan border.\n\nThe movement and the organisation that the world recognised as the Taliban has over the years evolved and now converted from being a unilateral, independent monolithic actor to a 'difficult to keep united' and fragmented alliance of many factions. Today very few Taliban fighters reside on the Pakistani side of the border; military action against them has pushed them to the Afghan side.\n\nTo summarise the American military intervention in Afghanistan, it would not be wrong to say that they have been fighting to sustain themselves rather than to achieve their mission and the world may witness a similar military disaster if the Trump administration does not learn lessons from a hard-fought Afghan war in which it hopped from executing one strategy to another. The new Afghan policy must have a well-defined political component that should extend a legal status to the Taliban as a political party thus providing them space for political participation. Else there would be no end to the war in Afghanistan and war in the final analysis war in Afghanistan will continue to remain a contest in stamina between these opposing forces.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kandah\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47494"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304051", "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305665", "label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Boot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "316952", "label": {"eng": "Max Boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "322022", "label": {"eng": "Hamid Karzai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "326337", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "326850", "label": {"eng": "Counter-insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Petraeus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "378881", "label": {"eng": "David Petraeus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_A._McChrystal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "378882", "label": {"eng": "Stanley A.

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an U.S. military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the center of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfill about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\"\n\nThe troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"},

All but one resulted from hostile enemy action, according to Defense Department data. It comes, too, as the United States' longest war nears the start of its 17th year, and the Trump administration remains without a clear strategy.\n\nThe ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, a group known as ISIS Khorasan, or ISIS-K, is entrenched along the country's mountainous border with Pakistan. Backed by U.S. troops and firepower, Afghan commando units have aggressively pursued its fighters for many months and shown some progress in disrupting their activity.\n\n[McCain releases strategy for Afghanistan, preempting and rebuking Trump]\n\nAmerican and Afghan troops launched Operation Hamza in early March. The following month, U.S. forces carried out a massive airstrike on an ISIS tunnel complex in Nangarhar's Achin district, reportedly killing upward of 100 militants. At the time, U.S. officials estimated that between 400 and 700 ISIS-K militants remained in Afghanistan.\n\nISIS-K is an offshoot of the terrorist group's core network in Iraq and Syria, receiving tactical guidance and financial support from outside Afghanistan but few additional fighters.\n\nAbout 14,000 U.S. and NATO troops remain in Afghanistan. With backing from the Pentagon, the war's top commander, Army Gen. John Nicholson, wants to expand his force by about 4,000 American troops, with a match from other NATO countries.\n\nThe White House has not committed to that plan.

(Reuters) - The United States should withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan and stop listening to \"stooges\"in Kabul, the Taleban said in an open letter to United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trump administration is working to finalise a regional strategy that could include nearly 4,000 additional US troops, part of a Nato-led coalition, that have been requested by commanders in the country.\n\nThat plan has faced scepticism in the White House, where Trump and several top aides have criticised years of American military intervention and foreign aid.\n\n\"Previous experiences have shown that sending more troops to Afghanistan will not result in anything other than further destruction of American military and economical might,\" the Taleban said in the English-language letter released to media and addressed to Trump.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\nThe Taleban, seeking to restore Islamic rule, have been waging an increasingly violent insurgency against the Western-backed Afghan government since losing power in a US-led military operation in 2001.\n\nIn the lengthy statement, the Taleban criticised the Afghan government as \"stooges\", \"lying corrupt leaders\" and \"repulsive sellouts\" who are providing Washington with overly optimistic\"rosy pictures\" of the situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The war situation in Afghanistan is far worse than you realize!\" the statement said, while arguing that the only thing preventing the insurgents from seizing major cities was a fear of causing civilian casualties.\n\nThe statement also took aim at generals, whom the Taleban said \"are concealing the real statistics of your dead and crippled\" soldiers.\n\n\"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan,\" the letter said. \"A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nThe senior US commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has requested several thousand additional troops to act as advisers to the struggling Afghan security forces.\n\nPowerful voices in the US government, including Republican Senator John McCain, have also called for an \"enduring\" US military presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taleban letter concludes by saying the conflict could be resolved by the withdrawal of foreign troops.\n\n\"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is foreign occupation,\" the Taleban said. \"The Afghans have no ill-intention towards the Americans or any other nation around the world but if anyone violates their sanctums then they are mighty proficient at beating and defeating the transgressors.\"", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict",

Regime supporters, allied tribal forces and opportunistic warlords escaped (or returned) to Pakistan's frontier regions to establish sanctuaries.\n\nSimilarly, while the Taliban's ouster also forced Al Qaeda into exile in Pakistan and elsewhere, the terror group nonetheless continued and expanded its terrorist activities. In Iraq and Syria, Al Qaeda morphed into the even more virulent ISIS, which is now gaining strength in Afghanistan.\n\nIn short, America's Afghan victories were significant, but incomplete. Subsequently, we failed to revise and update our Afghan strategic objectives, leading many to argue that the war had gone on too long and that we should withdraw. This criticism is superficially appealing, recalling anti-Vietnam War activist Allard Lowenstein's cutting remarks about Richard Nixon's policies. While Lowenstein acknowledged that he understood those, like Senator George Aiken, who said we should \"win and get out,\" Lowenstein said that he couldn't understand Nixon's strategy of \"lose and stay in.\"\n\nToday in Afghanistan, the pertinent question is what we seek to prevent, not what we seek to achieve. Making Afghanistan serene and peaceful does not constitute a legitimate American geopolitical interest. Instead, we face two principal threats.\n\nFirst, the Taliban's return to power throughout Afghanistan would re-create the prospect of the country being used as a base of operations for international terrorism. It is simply unacceptable to allow the pre-2001 status quo to re-emerge.\n\nSecond, a post-9/11 goal (at least one better understood today) is preventing a Taliban victory in Afghanistan that would enable the Pakistani Taliban or other terrorist groups to seize control in Islamabad. Not only would such a takeover make all of Pakistan yet another terrorist sanctuary, but if its large nuclear arsenal fell to terrorists, we would immediately face the equivalent of Iran and North Korea on nuclear steroids. Worryingly, Pakistan's military -- especially its intelligence arm -- is already thought to be controlled by radical Islamists.\n\nGiven terrorism's global spread since 9/11 and the risk of a perfect storm -- the confluence of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- the continuing threats we face in the Afghan arena are even graver than those posed before 9/11. Accordingly, abandoning the field in Afghanistan is simply not a tenable strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, accomplishing America's goals does not require remaking Afghanistan's government, economy or military in our image. Believing that only \"nation building\" in Afghanistan could ultimately guard against the terrorist threat was mistaken. For too long, it distracted Washington and materially contributed to the decline in American public support for a continuing military presence there, despite the manifest need for it.\n\nThere is no chance that the Trump administration will pursue \"nation building\" in Afghanistan, as the president has repeatedly made clear. Speaking as a Reagan administration alumnus of USAID, I concur. We should certainly continue bilateral economic assistance to Afghanistan, which, strategically applied, served America well in countless circumstances during the Cold War and thereafter. But we should not conflate it with the diaphanous prospect of nation building.\n\nNor should we assume that the military component in Afghanistan must be a repetition or expansion of the boots-on-the-ground approach that the US has followed since the initial assault on the Taliban. Other alternatives appear available and should be seriously considered, including possibly larger US military commitments of the right sort.\n\nEven more important, there must be far greater focus on Pakistan.\n\nPakistan -- a nuclear weapons state that has been politically unstable since British India's 1947 partition, and is increasingly under Chinese influence because of the hostility with India -- is a volatile and lethal mix ultimately more important than Afghanistan itself. Until and unless Pakistan becomes convinced that interfering in Afghanistan is too dangerous and too costly, no realistic US military scenario in Afghanistan can succeed.\n\nThe stakes are high on the subcontinent, not just because of the \"Af-Pak\" problems, but because Pakistan, India and China are all nuclear powers. The Trump administration should not be mesmerized only by US troop levels. It must concentrate urgently on the bigger strategic picture. The size and nature of America's military commitment in Afghanistan will more likely emerge from that analysis rather than the other way around.

Afghanistan risks becoming a global incubator of international terrorism. It has, in fact, already partially grown to become it,\" Kabulov said in an interview with Russia's Izvestiya newspaper.\n\nKabulov, who is also the Russian Foreign Ministry's director of the Second Asian Department in Afghanistan, therefore urged for withdrawal of the US troops from the country and said that Russia opposes the US idea to replace the regular US Army there with private military contractors.\n\n\"Moscow never hastened the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. But since the US Army [campaign] there has come to nothing, let them leave Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nSputnik Afghanistan discussed the issue with Afghan political analyst Akhtar Shakh Hamdard, who explained why the US won't leave the country \"any time soon\" despite reaching no success there.\n\n\"The US has long-term strategic plans for Afghanistan. They have built their military bases there. Americans have made serious investments into the region, where their opponents (Russia and China) may cause a serious damage to Washington through Afghanistan,\" the political analyst told Sputnik.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Omar SobhaniWhat's Behind Russia's Warning of 'Resorting to Military Force' in Afghanistan?He also echoed another comment of Zamir Kabulov, where he referred to the recent calls of Erik D. Prince, most infamous US military contractor and a founder of the private military company Blackwater Worldwide, to restore the British East India Company approach, which in effect ruled parts of India in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n\"It pretty much resembles a colonial policy. Prince suggested restoring the British East India Company. The Americans therefore revealed their plans: Afghanistan is nothing more than a colony for them,\" Kabulov told Izvestiya.\n\n\"The US has announced Central Asia a zone of their interests, as it is rich of explored natural resources reserves. Iran, which is also rich of oil and gas, is also of strategic importance to Washington. And the shortest route from the US to Iran is through Afghanistan,\" Akhtar Shakh Hamdard told Sputnik.\n\nThese are the reasons why the US won't leave any time soon and all the speculations on this topic are nothing but a usual political game of the US, the political analyst elaborated. Besides, he said, the US has made an agreement with the government of Afghanistan, which made their military present in the country absolutely legal.\n\nThe US is spending on Afghanistan about $20-25 billion, it is mere trifle for the country with an annual military budget of $600 billion, he said. The only thing the US is concerned about is its personnel losses in the country, which could lead to protests within the US.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik/ Alexandr GraschenkovMystery Aviation in Afghanistan: Whose is it?The political analyst also commented on whether the activity of Taliban and Daesh in Afghanistan might force the US to leave.\n\n\"Daesh is the project of the US, UK and Israel.

Daesh militants should have wiped off Shia regime in Iran, seizure the Caucasus and through Afghanistan - Central Asia,\" Akhtar Shakh Hamdard.\n\nThe successful Russia's campaign in Syria has foiled these invasive plans, however Daesh activities in Afghanistan won't force the US to leave the country, the political analyst concluded.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100, "id": 778, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12949"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302586"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "306135", "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349055", "label": {"eng": "Private military company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "438054", "label": {"eng": "East India Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "506623", "label": {"eng": "Academi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamir_Kabulov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "538245", "label": {"eng": "Zamir Kabulov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nDANGEROUS JOB\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an U.S. military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the centre of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nMORE ADVISERS NEED MORE PROTECTION\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfil about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\" The troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.

ISIS's core leadership continues to send funds to Afghanistan despite its depleted resources in its heartlands in Iraq and Syria but the U.N. report states that ISIS in Afghanistan would simply cease to exist without this support.\n\nThe militant group has instructed its affiliate in Afghanistan to push towards the north of of the country but despite its recruitment efforts over the past three years, the militants have not yet established a viable fighting force there.\n\nAt the end of July, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack on the Iraqi Embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul that began with a suicide bomber blowing himself up at the main gate, allowing gunmen to enter the building and battle security forces.\n\nAfghan security forces leave the site of an attack on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, July 31. REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail\n\nISIS has carried out attacks in the Afghan capital targeting members of the mainly Shiite Hazara community. The violence has fueled concerns of a possible spillover into Afghanistan of sectarian violence of the kind seen in Syria and Iraq, Reuters reported.\n\nThe alliances between different groups remain in flux. At the beginning of this month, Afghan officials said Afghan Taliban fighters, separate to the Pakistani Taliban and usually oppsed to ISIS, joined forces with Sher Mohammed Ghazanfar, a commander who has pledged allegiance to the militant group, massacring dozens of civilians in a village.\n\nAQIS and the Taliban are far stronger in terms of internal funding sources and recruits. The two groups are increasingly working alongside each other, causing havoc for the U.S-backed coalition that is trying to degrade them.\n\nThe U.N. estimates there may be as many as 7,000 AQIS and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. As the Taliban continues to wield substantial influence over AQIS, many Al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area have integrated into the Taliban, increasing its military capability.\n\nAlso in July, 35 people were killed in a Taliban attack on government workers in Kabul, underlining Afghanistan's precarious security situation as the United States considers an overhaul of its policy in the region.\n\nWhite House concerns about levels of troops in Afghanistan have reportedly led the Trump administration to a point where it is considering withdrawing U.S. troops from the beleaguered country altogether, against recommendations from the Pentagon.\n\nWithout a clear strategy set out by defense officials, a schism has opened in the administration over U.S. involvement in the country. At the end of April the U.S. military said it would deploy 1,500 soldiers to Afghanistan in response to ISIS and Taliban attacks. However, without broad agreement, it looks unlikely the U.S. will send out forces this summer.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "303301", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303396", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303510", "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303634", "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304453", "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309442", "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazara_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319781", "label": {"eng": "Hazara people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "333644", "label": {"eng": "Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "373435", "label": {"eng": "Durand Line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda_in_the_Indian_Subcontinent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1381239", "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent"}}]}

McCain's proposal does not include a troop-level estimate but calls for far more additional combat advisers than the generals have requested.\n\nSo far, Trump has not decided on any of the options the military has offered, and instead has raised questions about whether the Afghan War is still worth it, current and former military officials have told POLITICO. And he may well go with an idea from another quarter. White House advisers like Steve Bannon are reported to favor replacing uniformed combat advisers with thousands of armed private contractors. The result could be a hybrid option: replacing some advisers with contractors, for example, while leaving other advising tasks in military hands.\n\nThere is broad agreement among former government officials who have served in Afghanistan, however, that pulling up stakes and leaving the Afghan government forces on their own, in the face of widening Taliban advances even with allied support, is not a credible option.\n\n\"A Taliban-controlled Afghanistan is an Afghanistan that is hospitable to Al Qaeda,\" said David Sedney, a former diplomat who oversaw Afghanistan policy for the Pentagon under President Barack Obama and is now a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"They've been a host for Al Qaeda, and their ideology is such that they will always be a potential host for Al Qaeda.\"\n\nNone of the current and former government officials and military officers who spoke to POLITICO thought Trump was likely to tell the military to just keep doing what it's been doing in Afghanistan, although that is one of the options the Pentagon is presenting.\n\nSince the withdrawal of the last large U.S. ground combat units in 2014, the military headquarters in Kabul has overseen a strategy with two parallel tracks -- advise-and-assist and counterterrorism. At the same time, they're constrained by an Obama-era troop cap that limits the number of American service members in the country. The cap is 8,400, although troops on short-term assignments are thought to push the number to 10,000 or more.\n\nWith Afghan losses growing heavier each year and more districts steadily falling under the sway of the Taliban, the latest commander in Kabul, Gen. John Nicholson, initiated his own strategy review when he took charge in early 2016. Afterward he started sending some advisers on tactical missions with conventional Afghan army brigades, using troops already in theater.\n\nGen. Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, \"believed General Nicholson's strategy was about as good as it could be given the resources that were allocated,\" a senior officer familiar with that review said. But for the Afghans to reverse the Taliban's momentum, Nicholson concluded that he would need more troops for more brigade-level adviser teams, and he said as much in congressional testimony in February, soon after Trump took office.\n\n2) Send thousands more troops\n\nNicholson's requested \"uplift package,\" as the military refers to the proposed reinforcements, would be deployed not for a short-term surge but for a long-term shift in how the military advises and assists Afghan troops.\n\nSome 4,000 fresh troops would form additional brigade adviser teams, partner up with an Afghan commando force that is set to double in size over the next few years, and step up support to Afghan forces countrywide with more closely coordinated air, artillery and rocket strikes. Units of HIMARS long-range rockets, which U.S. forces have used heavily to support their Iraqi and Syrian allies over the past year, would form part of the uplift package.\n\nMeanwhile, the existing special operations task force would continue the current counterterrorism mission against Al Qaeda and the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State in areas the Taliban controls, using drone strikes and night raids.\n\nNo one in the military is suggesting that the \"uplift\" would deliver a speedy turnaround in the war. \"There's about a three-year horizon to get sustainable gains here,\" even with the reinforcements, said one American officer in Kabul.\n\nThat matches with a four-year \"road map\" for improvement that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has promulgated for his forces. But it may be too long of a timeline to impress Trump, who, before he was a presidential candidate, often tweeted his displeasure at the long slog and high cost of the Afghan War effort.\n\nThe plan McCain proposed earlier this month as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 1519 (115), is essentially a much-expanded version of the uplift plan, calling for adviser teams to embed not just with a few Afghan army brigades but with many of their subordinate battalions.\n\nThat would be a much more manpower-intensive task and would risk many more American casualties, and there is no indication that McCain's proposal will be up for discussion at Camp David on Friday.\n\n3) Send private contractors\n\nThe proposal that controversial former Blackwater chief executive Erik Prince has been shopping in recent weeks, for a partial privatization of the advisory and air support missions, has met a chilly reception in the Pentagon and especially in Kabul.\n\nLike the McCain plan, it calls for advisers to embed with Afghan battalions on battlefields all around the country, risking heavy casualties on the teams. The difference is that the advisers would be private contractors, not soldiers and Marines, which Prince contends would cut costs.\n\nPutting contractors at the forefront of the advisory effort would probably cause a firestorm in Kabul, however, and badly undermine the military's, State Department's and CIA's carefully cultivated relationships with the Afghan government.\n\n\"In appropriate roles, contractors can be of real assistance,\" said Douglas Ollivant, a former Army officer who was himself a contractor in Afghanistan during the surge there, providing advice to U.S. commanders. \"But I can't imagine any sovereign country being OK with what we're hearing about. Having them in the baggage train, in a supporting role, is something you learn to live with, but having third-party mercenaries holding the guns and making the decisions is something else altogether.\"\n\nThe legal question of \"inherent government functions\" casts a shadow over the Prince plan, too. Prince has proposed getting around this by putting the contractors under CIA, rather than Pentagon, control. But that would radically redefine the intelligence agency's involvement in the country and potentially raise more fresh legal issues than it would answer.\n\n4) Withdraw\n\nPulling up stakes and leaving might have the most emotional appeal to Trump of all the options. Before his White House run, he took to Twitter repeatedly to advocate just that. \"Let's get out of Afghanistan,\" he tweeted in 2013. \"Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA.\" That message fits with the \"America First\" platform that Trump campaign on, too.\n\nBut former officials with long experience in the region warn that the U.S. has essential interests in Afghanistan -- the same ones that drew the military there in 2001 -- and that ceding large parts of the country to the Taliban would open the door to an expanded Al Qaeda presence there.\n\nThe Taliban plays host to Al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan's rugged northeast and other remote areas already, and Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, swore allegiance last year to the Taliban's latest emir, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada.\n\n\"The core reason we went into Afghanistan was to prevent another attack on the U.S. homeland from Afghanistan by Al Qaeda, and so far we have achieved that,\" said Sedney, the former Obama Pentagon official, who was also acting ambassador in Kabul early in the George W. Bush administration. \"But we have not succeeded in placing Afghanistan into an overall political, military and economic situation where that is not likely to happen again. The country retains the potential to be a source of future acts of terrorism against the United States.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100,

Some of the troops quietly wept.\n\nFew details about the blast were available, including a firm number of U.S. wounded or the name of the soldier who was killed. One U.S. official said most of the injured American troops had already been released from medical care.\n\nTwo officials said the U.S. and Afghan forces were hit by an explosion inside a building in Nangarhar. They did not say what caused the explosion.\n\nFor Wilson, a former congresswoman who took over the Air Force's top civilian job three months ago, the ceremony was an unexpected part of her reintroduction to the Afghan war.\n\nWith the latest death, 10 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year, according to the U.S. military. Nearly 2,400 American troops have been killed since the war began in response to al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\n\nThe incident was a reminder of the high stakes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers requests from the top commander in Afghanistan for thousands more troops beyond the roughly 8,400 who are already here.\n\nThe goal would be to help Afghan forces break a stalemate against Taliban insurgents and, at the same time, prevent rival Islamic State fighters from expanding here as their territory shrinks in Syria and Iraq.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.\n\nTrump, Vice President Mike Pence and his national security team are scheduled to discuss Afghan war strategy and regional policy guiding it at a meeting at Camp David on Friday.\n\nWilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein declined to wade into the policy debate about Afghanistan. But, Wilson said, \"Nothing has changed or is likely to change with respect to America's determination to go after terrorists wherever they may be.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's

Hadley was national security adviser to President George W. Bush.\n\nAfter 16 years of sacrifice in Afghanistan, President Trump is right to ask why we are there and what does it take to win.\n\nThe United States has vital national interests in Afghanistan. Since 9/11, preventing another terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland has remained our key objective. While the cost in lives and treasure has been too high, this objective has largely been achieved. But it has required a sustained U.S. troop presence, the active participation of our NATO allies and a close partnership with the Afghan government.\n\nIf the Trump administration now opts to draw down U.S. military forces, the NATO allies would go home and the Afghan state would likely collapse. The result would be a victory for the terrorists. It would undo the Trump administration's recent success against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and provide the Islamic State a haven in Afghanistan from which to foment attacks on the United States.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration can deliver another major blow against terrorism. The Islamic State and al-Qaeda seek to expand their presence in Afghanistan, but virtually none of the Afghan groups -- including the Taliban -- support them. They can be defeated in Afghanistan just as they are being pushed out of Iraq and Syria. This natural extension of the Iraq/Syria campaign would help consolidate the victory against the Islamic State. But it will require U.S. counterterrorism forces to continue operating alongside Afghan security forces.\n\nThe challenge will then be to preserve the victory and help the Afghan people stabilize their country so that the Islamic State and al-Qaeda do not return. This can be done with a political/diplomatic strategy that seeks an inclusive settlement among all Afghan political factions while creating a more legitimate, popularly supported government that addresses the conflict's root causes.\n\nThere has been some progress. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is committed to reform. The Afghan defense forces are bravely fighting at tremendous cost. But the Afghan government must boost its legitimacy by broadening its base of popular support, fighting corruption and ensuring credible presidential elections in 2019. Continued U.S. support must be conditioned on these steps.\n\nThe big question is what to do about the Taliban. The answer: Test its interest in peace.\n\nDefeating terrorist groups that threaten the United States does not include or require defeating the Taliban. The United States and NATO must make clear that they will fully support an Afghan-led political settlement involving all sectors of Afghan society -- including the Taliban.\n\nTo give the Afghan government, military forces and society the confidence to enter into such a process, the Trump administration should authorize the modest increase in U.S. and NATO troop levels recommended by the local U.S. commander. The Afghan government can then credibly tell the Taliban that it will pay a heavy price for continuing to fight, but is welcome to participate in a political settlement.\n\nIf the Taliban prove unwilling, then the United States can still protect its interest by continued support for the Afghan government -- conditioned on reform -- and by further training, advising and assisting the Afghan armed forces so they can continue to keep the Islamic State and al-Qaeda from returning . Even at somewhat increased U.S. troop levels and associated costs, this is an acceptable price to pay to avoid terrorist attacks on our homeland. The Afghan government and its people will then have to outlast the Taliban's appetite for the fight, just as the Colombian government was able to do with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia .\n\nThis new strategy will require U.S. leadership in two additional respects.\n\nFirst, it will require a new U.S. approach to Pakistan that seeks to address its strategic concerns. This means supporting Pakistan more directly in dealing with its internal terrorist threat and the terrorist threat from Afghan territory. This means helping to restart a discrete dialogue between India and Pakistan on issues of mutual concern while encouraging greater regional economic integration. At the same time, Pakistan must show progress in cutting off terrorist activity against India and Afghanistan (including by the Haqqani network) -- with targeted sanctions and other steps to raise the costs to Pakistan if it fails to do so.\n\nSecond, U.S. diplomatic efforts will need to focus on rebuilding a regional consensus on the need for a relatively peaceful and stable Afghanistan. To end the war, the United States should support regional mechanisms such as the Quadrilateral Coordination Group consisting of the United States, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan. More broad-based groups of Afghanistan's neighbors and related regional actors should also be engaged. Russia and Iran should be offered a positive role as an alternative to their increasing support for the Taliban and other problematic groups.\n\nA new Trump administration strategy along these lines can provide a clear victory over the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. It can contribute to a political outcome that can stabilize Afghanistan and preserve that victory.

(Photo by Capt. Thomas Cieslak/ U.S. Army)\n\nThe Pentagon has identified the U.S. Army Green Beret who was killed Wednesday battling Islamic State militants in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nStaff Sgt. Aaron R. Butler, 27, of Monticello, Utah was killed by an improvised explosive device in Nangahar Province, the Pentagon said in a statement late Thursday. An unknown number of U.S. troops were also injured during the fighting as were several Afghan troops working alongside their American counterparts.\n\n[A U.S. service member is killed, others wounded, fighting ISIS in Afghanistan]\n\nButler belonged to a Special Forces team from 19th Special Force Group and was based out of Camp Williams Utah. The 19th Group is an Army National Guard unit with detachments all over the United States, including Washington and Colorado. A Green Beret from 19th Group, Staff Sgt. Matthew McClintock, was the first U.S. combat death in Afghanistan for the year 2016.\n\nButler's death brings the total of Americans killed by hostile fire in Afghanistan this year to 10. Seven of those deaths were directly related to fighting Islamic State militants in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe U.S. military has invested considerable resources and troops in battling the Islamic State's Afghan affiliate. Yet despite numerous offensive operations and a concerted bombing campaign that involved the use of a 22,000-pound bomb and several surgical strikes against the group's leaders, about 1,000 of the militants have remained dug in along the Pakistani border, according to U.S. military officials in Kabul.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn bid to beat back the Taliban, Afghanistan starts expanding its commando

They ignore the positive side and broader geopolitics of the region. Pakistan and Iran are both tacitly training and recruiting insurgents in the region, while Russia still has ties to the Taliban that complicate politics in the region. Over all of this, ambiguity still looms over U.S. strategy.\n\nAfghanistan is a country that connects Central Asia with South Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The geographic location of Afghanistan has made the country most vulnerable in terms of hosting the great game among super powers. The United States, Russia, China, India, Pakistan and Iran all have stakes in the country.\n\nOn the other hand, Afghanistan has occupied the world's attention for the past sixteen years for all the wrong reasons. Terrorist attacks, day to day bombing, fighting and the doom and gloom headlines that appear on daily basis in the news media, have created a wrong image of the country.\n\nIn the effort to take responsibility for the war from coalition forces, the Afghan national security forces fight against terrorists every day. They are keeping the country safe and deny terrorists the territory and foothold to launch attacks against West and particularly the U.S. On average, each day 20 members of the Afghan national security forces give up their lives in the war against terrorism. In a summer show of force, the Taliban tried several times to take hold of some major cities. But they were pushed back by Afghan forces.\n\nGiven the fact that thousands of Afghan, American and coalition lives have been sacrificed during the past 16 years, we need win this war. After all these sacrifices, freedom and a thriving democracy in the region cannot be compromised and handed over to terrorists who think nothing of killing innocent civilians in their campaign of terror and pursuit of power.\n\nThe past two years were tough and challenging for the country. Internal political crises and challenges such as Afghan security forces assuming full responsibility of war, lack of necessary capabilities like not having close air support, medevac, surveillance and other necessary equipment, and a declining job market have put tremendous pressure on the government.\n\nDespite all these formidable challenges, Afghanistan stood strong and is determined to route out terrorists. A progressive, democratic government is in place with a vision of peace, development and prosperity. A country that once was the worst place on earth for women now protects women's rights. From parliament to civil society, from media to government, brave women have had a chance to raise their voices and contribute to national development.\n\nYes, there are still many challenges with which the country is grappling. Insecurity, institutionalized corruption, an inefficient system of governance, lack of accountability and transparency, the limited reach of the rule of law across the country and a powerful illegal drug industry are a few. Roiled by three decades of conflict, the country has inherited many problems.\n\nWe need to respect the sacrifices of those who have lost their lives for the mission to keep the world safe. What kind of message will we have for the families who have lost their loved ones if we leave the mission unaccomplished? Afghanistan and the U.S. are critical partners in the mission. They have common enemies and shared interests and goals. The two countries have come too far and made too much progress in the past decade and a half to falter now. The relationship should continue and constant as both countries need each other. America needs Afghanistan as much as Afghanistan needs America.\n\nWithout U.S. support, all these achievements will be in danger and Afghanistan could fall prey to neighboring countries, their sponsored proxies, and terrorists bent on gaining power. The lack of a strategy only generates problems and doubts. It also encourages countries such as Pakistan and Iran to hedge bets over the ambiguous and uncertain situation, and to increase their support to the enemy.\n\nEven as the U.S. government is negotiating its new strategy in the region, the enemy is stepping up their attacks and colluding with other interests in the region to put pressure on the Afghan government and cause worry among policymakers in Washington. But the fact is that they cannot stand against Afghan security forces as long as the partnership with America remains strong.\n\nAhmad Shah Katawazai (@askatawazai) is the defense liaison for the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington, D.C.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "302586"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303921", "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305998", "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310769", "label": {"eng": "War on Terror"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "313490"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317071", "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "317585", "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "389097", "label": {"eng": "Close air support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

A withdrawal from Afghanistan could mean that the Iranian Regime succeeds further in its destabilisation of the Middle East.\n\nThe Taliban wrote: \"We have noticed that you have understood the errors of your predecessors and have resolved to thoroughly rethink your new strategy in Afghanistan. A number of warmongering congressmen and generals in Afghanistan are pressing you to protract the war in Afghanistan because they seek to preserve their military privileges.\"\n\nUS Defense Secretary James Mattis said that the White House was \"very, very close\" to a decision on Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban told Reuters that they wanted to have peace talks but only if the US withdrew their troops.\n\nThe letter read: \"Everyone now understands that the main driver of war in Afghanistan is a foreign occupation.

It's a longer-term, non-military approach to the conflict that envisages a tripling of trade flows between Pakistan-Afghanistan, the departure of U.S. troops and better military and intelligence cooperation.\n\nThe bespectacled diplomat stressed that the influential preacher Maulana Sami-ul-Haq -- whose seminary trained Taliban leaders Mullah Omar and Akhtar Mohammad Mansour -- had a responsibility to end a conflict that is killing innocent Muslims.\n\n\"I didn't have any reservations,\" said Zakhilwal in an interview at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad of his visits to the controversial school. \"It's an obligation, a religious obligation, that he uses his influence and religious credentials to lessen that suffering.\"\n\nPakistan has long been accused of allowing Afghan Taliban fighters sanctuary within its borders. Zakhilwal's appeal to ul-Haq underscores the complexity of ending the 16-year war in Afghanistan and the need the need for a political solution that draws in Taliban fighters who have fought an insurgency against U.S.-backed forces. With China spending more than $50 billion on planned infrastructure projects in Pakistan, he also hopes Beijing may use its economic leverage to push Islamabad toward a peace deal.\n\nIt won't be easy. America's longest war is destabilizing South Asia and costing Washington roughly $23 billion per year. It's holding back economic growth in Pakistan, the region's second-largest economy, although a sustained crackdown by Pakistan's military has gone some way to improving security and boosting confidence in the economy.\n\nThe Taliban, however, is unlikely to come to the table because they believe the Kabul government is weak and U.S. strategy is in disarray. Last week, Senator John McCain said U.S. President Donald Trump has \"no strategy at all\" amid a State Department policy review.\n\nZakhilwal is \"doing this because he thinks it offers some opportunity at a time when other alternatives really look very unpromising,\" said Ashley Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who previously advised the U.S. government on policy in the region. \"The best he's going to get is a patchwork solution with local ceasefires in some areas. The metric for success will be much more unclear. Because it's not going to be peace or war. It will be peace and war.\"\n\nAlthough Islamabad has cracked down on militants targeting Pakistan, the U.S. accuses the country of supporting insurgents who strike inside Afghanistan and India, including U.S.-designated terrorist group the Haqqani Network. Both Pakistan's government and its military have consistently denied they have given sanctuary or support to the militants.\n\nAfter an explosion killed at least 150 people in Kabul on May 31, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Pakistan was waging an \"undeclared war of aggression\" against his country, an accusation Islamabad said was \"unwarranted.\"\n\nZakhilwal said relations have improved, despite Ghani's comments, noting Pakistan had stopped forcing Afghan refugees to return to Afghanistan. However, the larger issue of Pakistan's support for the Afghan Taliban remains unresolved.\n\n\"Pakistan can do more to use whatever influence they have on the Taliban,\" said Zakhilwal, a former Afghan finance minister. \"For peace with the Taliban, Pakistan has some influence. Direct interaction could be certainly helpful.\"\n\nZakhilwal is also hoping Beijing will assert \"influence over Pakistan,\" pushing it toward peace in order to secure a better investment climate for billions worth of projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\n\"China could only be genuinely interested in peace in Afghanistan for its investments in Pakistan,\" he said. \"China is a next-door neighbor to both countries. Instability in any of these countries does not serve China's interest.\"\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions.\n\nAfghanistan-Pakistan trade -- totaling only $1.6 billion in 2016 -- has declined for years. Zakhilwal said he is trying to \"compartmentalize trade\" in discussions with Pakistani officials to potentially triple trade flows, helping to reduce the poverty that drives people toward militancy and the opium trade, of which Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer.\n\n\"If we have lawlessness there will be drugs,\" he said.\n\nZakhilwal hopes preachers such as ul-Haq can use their influence for peace and said he \"certainly has done things which show he wants to be helpful.\"\n\n\"Whatever the influence of Maulana is, I do believe it could be used for peace and stability in Afghanistan,\" he said, using the preacher's honorific. \"I put him on the phone with President Ghani in one of my meetings.\"\n\nAnalysts aren't sure that will work. Carnegie's Tellis said Pakistan's goal continues to be a weak and \"subordinate\" Afghanistan. And current battlefield commanders oppose any talks while American soldiers remain in Afghanistan, said Abdul Basit, an associate research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"When Kabul is struggling, when Washington is struggling with its own Afghan policy, why should the Taliban come to the table?\" Basit said. \"If anyone has influence, it's the Pakistani military establishment.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of

How are they going to fight against the Taliban?\" the diplomat wondered.\n\nThe US Department of Defense has spent more than $76 billion on weapons and equipment for the Afghan security forces since 2002, the US Government Accountability Office said last week.\n\nWashington has paid for 600,000 weapons, including rifles and pistols, for the Afghan Army and police, the GAO report, released on Thursday, said.\n\nThe key equipment provided included 163,000 tactical and non-tactical radios; 76,000 vehicles, such as Humvees; 30,000 equipment items for disposing of explosives, such as bomb disposal robots; and 16,000 equipment items for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, such as unmanned surveillance drones, just to name a handful.\n\nThe report came as President Donald Trump said he is \"very close\" to announcing a new strategy on Afghanistan.\n\n\"It's a very big decision for me,\" he told reporters in Bedminster on Thursday.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12949"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303299", "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304163", "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304332", "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306002", "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "306135", "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "315405", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izvestia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317981", "label": {"eng": "Izvestia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "319740", "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324819", "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329335", "label": {"eng": "Bomb disposal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "384527", "label": {"eng": "Humvee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamir_Kabulov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "538245", "label": {"eng": "Zamir Kabulov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

Some of the troops quietly wept.\n\nFew details about the blast were available, including a firm number of U.S. wounded or the name of the soldier who was killed. One U.S. official said most of the injured American troops had already been released from medical care.\n\nTwo officials said the U.S. and Afghan forces were hit by an explosion inside a building in Nangarhar. They did not say what caused the explosion.\n\nFor Wilson, a former congresswoman who took over the Air Force's top civilian job three months ago, the ceremony was an unexpected part of her reintroduction to the Afghan war.\n\nWith the latest death, 10 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year, according to the U.S. military. Nearly 2,400 American troops have been killed since the war began in response to al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\n\nThe incident was a reminder of the high stakes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers requests from the top commander in Afghanistan for thousands more troops beyond the roughly 8,400 who are already here.\n\nThe goal would be to help Afghan forces break a stalemate against Taliban insurgents and, at the same time, prevent rival Islamic State fighters from expanding here as their territory shrinks in Syria and Iraq.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.\n\nTrump, Vice President Mike Pence and his national security team are scheduled to discuss Afghan war strategy and regional policy guiding it at a meeting at Camp David on Friday.\n\nWilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein declined to wade into the policy debate about Afghanistan. But, Wilson said, \"Nothing has changed or is likely to change with respect to America's determination to go after terrorists wherever they may be.\" (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Toni Reinhold)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 287, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47377"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303510", "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "304965", "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305998", "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306135", "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309668", "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317222", "label": {"eng": "Taliban insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323686", "label": {"eng": "Camp David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Air_Force", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "331851", "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336083", "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagram_Airfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "377676", "label": {"eng": "Bagram Airfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "508893", "label": {"eng": "Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "952183", "label": {"eng": "Heather Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet\u2013Afghan_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1118979", "label": {"eng": "Soviet\u2013Afghan War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

It's a longer-term, non-military approach to the conflict that envisages a tripling of trade flows between Pakistan-Afghanistan, the departure of U.S. troops and better military and intelligence cooperation.\n\nThe bespectacled diplomat stressed that the influential preacher Maulana Sami-ul-Haq -- whose seminary trained Taliban leaders Mullah Omar and Akhtar Mohammad Mansour -- had a responsibility to end a conflict that is killing innocent Muslims.\n\n\"I didn't have any reservations,\" said Zakhilwal in an interview at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad of his visits to the controversial school. \"It's an obligation, a religious obligation, that he uses his influence and religious credentials to lessen that suffering.\"\n\nPakistan has long been accused of allowing Afghan Taliban fighters sanctuary within its borders. Zakhilwal's appeal to ul-Haq underscores the complexity of ending the 16-year war in Afghanistan and the need the need for a political solution that draws in Taliban fighters who have fought an insurgency against U.S.-backed forces. With China spending more than $50 billion on planned infrastructure projects in Pakistan, he also hopes Beijing may use its economic leverage to push Islamabad toward a peace deal.\n\nIt won't be easy. America's longest war is destabilizing South Asia and costing Washington roughly $23 billion per year. It's holding back economic growth in Pakistan, the region's second-largest economy, although a sustained crackdown by Pakistan's military has gone some way to improving security and boosting confidence in the economy.\n\nThe Taliban, however, is unlikely to come to the table because they believe the Kabul government is weak and U.S. strategy is in disarray. Last week, Senator John McCain said U.S. President Donald Trump has \"no strategy at all\" amid a State Department policy review.\n\nZakhilwal is \"doing this because he thinks it offers some opportunity at a time when other alternatives really look very unpromising,\" said Ashley Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who previously advised the U.S. government on policy in the region. \"The best he's going to get is a patchwork solution with local ceasefires in some areas. The metric for success will be much more unclear. Because it's not going to be peace or war. It will be peace and war.\n\nAlthough Islamabad has cracked down on militants targeting Pakistan, the U.S. accuses the country of supporting insurgents who strike inside Afghanistan and India, including U.S.-designated terrorist group the Haqqani Network. Both Pakistan's government and its military have consistently denied they have given sanctuary or support to the militants.\n\nAfter an explosion killed at least 150 people in Kabul on May 31, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Pakistan was waging an \"undeclared war of aggression\" against his country, an accusation Islamabad said was \"unwarranted.\"\n\nZakhilwal said relations have improved, despite Ghani's comments, noting Pakistan had stopped forcing Afghan refugees to return to Afghanistan. However, the larger issue of Pakistan's support for the Afghan Taliban remains unresolved.\n\n\"Pakistan can do more to use whatever influence they have on the Taliban,\" said Zakhilwal, a former Afghan finance minister. \"For peace with the Taliban, Pakistan has some influence. Direct interaction could be certainly helpful.\"\n\nZakhilwal is also hoping Beijing will assert \"influence over Pakistan,\" pushing it toward peace in order to secure a better investment climate for billions worth of projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\n\"China could only be genuinely interested in peace in Afghanistan for its investments in Pakistan,\" he said. \"China is a next-door neighbor to both countries. Instability in any of these countries does not serve China's interest.\"\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions.\n\nAfghanistan-Pakistan trade -- totaling only $1.6 billion in 2016 -- has declined for years. Zakhilwal said he is trying to \"compartmentalize trade\" in discussions with Pakistani officials to potentially triple trade flows, helping to reduce the poverty that drives people toward militancy and the opium trade, of which Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer.\n\n\"If we have lawlessness there will be drugs,\" he said.\n\nZakhilwal hopes preachers such as ul-Haq can use their influence for peace and said he \"certainly has done things which show he wants to be helpful.\"\n\n\"Whatever the influence of Maulana is, I do believe it could be used for peace and stability in Afghanistan,\" he said, using the preacher's honorific. \"I put him on the phone with President Ghani in one of my meetings.\"\n\nAnalysts aren't sure that will work. Carnegie's Tellis said Pakistan's goal continues to be a weak and \"subordinate\" Afghanistan. And current battlefield commanders oppose any talks while American soldiers remain in Afghanistan, said Abdul Basit, an associate research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"When Kabul is struggling, when Washington is struggling with its own Afghan policy, why should the Taliban come to the table?\" Basit said. \"If anyone has influence, it's the Pakistani military establishment.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories":

That is why we are here and that is why we must win,\" said Nicholson.\n\nAs United States President Donald Trump is set to unveil its new military policy in Afghanistan, Nicholson said that they should and will defeat the insurgents to safeguard their own homeland.\n\n\"If we fail in Afghanistan, we will invite terror attacks on our homelands.

As a result, President Donald Trump has been left with a disaster on his hands. Loser superpower,\" Senator Aleksey Pushkov tweeted.\n\nPushkov released this comment soon after Taliban released an open letter to Trump in which it claimed that the military operation in Afghanistan was in vain despite the huge costs, both in terms of human casualties and material losses. The letter then urged Trump to make a decision that would always see him remembered as an advocate of peace.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed receipt of the Taliban's open letter and said that Washington was considering various options as far as possible troop removal from Afghanistan is concerned.\n\nEarlier this week, the Russian president's special envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said in a press interview that the US campaign in Afghanistan had failed and Washington needs to withdraw troops. He added that Moscow strongly opposes the plan to replace the regular US military forces in Afghanistan with military contractors.\n\nOn Thursday, the deputy head of the Russian upper house Committee for International Affairs, Andrey Klimov, told reporters that Kabulov's statement was a sign that Moscow intended to use political and diplomatic leverage to prevent further spreading of US military presence.\n\n\"A US-led military intervention has been taking place for 16 years, right near the CIS borders. And considering the fact that the borders within the CIS are transparent this means that this is happening right near our borders,\" Klimov said in comments with Vzglyad internet daily. The CIS is the Commonwealth of Independent States - a Russia-led political and economic bloc of former Soviet republics.\n\n\"In recent years this has borne no resemblance to an anti-terrorist operation and looks more like a colonial policy, an attempt to keep the US military contingent there at any cost,\" he added.\n\nThe senator also noted that previously Russia has approved of the military operation conducted by the US and its NATO allies in Afghanistan, and even provided assistance to this operation, but this position has been reconsidered because of the deterioration of Russia-US relations and also because the operation in Afghanistan has failed to yield any positive results.\n\n\"Quite some time ago is became clear that the anti-terrorist operation conducted by the US and NATO in Afghanistan is ineffective, but in the course of this operation the flow of illegal drugs into Russia has increased many-fold, according to some estimations even 100-fold,\" he said.\n\n\"All this calls for a reaction and the first statements made on the subject reveal that Russia intends to use political and diplomatic means to prevent this gray spreading of the US military presence in Afghanistan,\" the senator concluded.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 163, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military"},

While its unclear whether Butler was that particular trooper who was killed, iCasualties.org has not yet added to that death toll count as of press time.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 287, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Nangarh\u0101r"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47377"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monticello"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello,_Utah", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monticello"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231727"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231788"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315405", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "338965", "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "342305", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "712636", "label": {"eng": "Camp Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_Special_Forces_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "876592", "label": {"eng": "19th Special Forces Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_Support_Mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1277132", "label": {"eng": "Resolute Support Mission"}}]}

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nDANGEROUS JOB\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an U.S. military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the centre of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nMORE ADVISERS NEED MORE PROTECTION\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfil about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\" The troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "date": "2017-08-18",

It ended when the U.S. and its coalition allies marked the official conclusion of their combat mission in Afghanistan in 2014. But with the goal of stabilizing the country unachieved, plans for an exit of the NATO-led forces have been put off. The remaining 13,400 foreign troops in Afghanistan -- 8,500 of them American -- support a government that faces intensifying attacks from the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalists who once ruled the country. A departure of the coalition would leave a weak Afghan military vulnerable to defeat at the hands of its tenacious enemies.\n\nSince the Afghan military officially became responsible for security in 2014, conflict in the country has escalated. The radical group Islamic State established a presence in the country's east and has claimed credit for terrorist attacks in the capital Kabul. The larger threat is the resurgent Taliban, which has expanded its territorial reach. Afghan and U.S. officials have expressed increasing concern over evidence that Russia may be arming the group; Russian officials have denied it. About a tenth of Afghanistan's districts are under insurgent control, and another third or so are contested. Civilian casualties rose to 11,418 last year, a record since the United Nations began tracking them in 2009. More than 660,000 people fled their homes because of the conflict in 2016, also a record and a 40 percent increase from 2015. The coalition led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization provides training and advice to the Afghan military, which has been hampered by insufficient air power and heavy combat losses and desertions. Additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan are part of a counter-terrorism force. U.S. President Donald Trump's top military advisers have recommended deploying an additional 3,000 to 5,000 forces, according to a White House official. Defense Secretary James Mattis told lawmakers Trump gave him the authority to determine the appropriate troop level.\n\nIn 1989, the Soviet military pulled out of Afghanistan, after a decade-long occupation that had made the country a front line in the Cold War. The U.S., which actively supported the Soviets' opponents, including radical Islamist factions, also disengaged. Bloody chaos followed until the Taliban seized Kabul from the feuding warlords who had all but leveled it. The Taliban imposed stern theocratic rule and gave the terrorist group al-Qaeda a base. In 2001, after the Taliban refused to extradite al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden following his group's Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., the U.S. invaded Afghanistan. When Bin Laden and the Taliban leadership fled, the U.S. mission morphed into a nation-building undertaking -- but with limited military resources, as the U.S. focused on a separate war in Iraq. Eventually, more than 50 nations joined a coalition led by NATO. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama ordered a \"surge\" in forces that reached a peak of 140,000 in 2011. Military commanders reported progress on the ground, but war fatigue at home, especially after the killing of Bin Laden in Pakistan, led Obama to start winding down the American troop presence. Doubts that the Afghan military could stand on its own prompted him to leave the last of them in place when he turned the presidency over to Trump in January. An estimated 165,000 people been killed in the conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Efforts to organize peace talks have stalled, with the Taliban saying it wouldn't negotiate until all foreign forces leave the country.\n\nSome U.S. intelligence officials and lawmakers think it's time to bring all the troops home. They fear getting drawn further into the fighting if the Kabul government falters. Others say that the U.S. shouldn't just walk away after such a commitment of lives and money. They argue that, with help, the Afghan government can contain the Taliban and prevent the resurgence of al-Qaeda. Both sides point to Iraq, where the government forced the U.S. into a total withdrawal in 2011. The rise of Islamic State there prompted a return of U.S. forces three years later. The intervention began as a training and bombing mission, but expanded to include special forces. And even noncombat troops have been killed. The Iraq experience can stand as a reminder of the perils of a complete pullout -- or of the reasons for getting out before the bottom drops out.\n\nTerry Atlas contributed to the original version of

As a result, President Donald Trump has been left with a disaster on his hands. Loser superpower,\" Senator Aleksey Pushkov tweeted.\n\nPushkov released this comment soon after Taliban released an open letter to Trump in which it claimed that the military operation in Afghanistan was in vain despite the huge costs, both in terms of human casualties and material losses. The letter then urged Trump to make a decision that would always see him remembered as an advocate of peace.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed receipt of the Taliban's open letter and said that Washington was considering various options as far as possible troop removal from Afghanistan is concerned.\n\nEarlier this week, the Russian president's special envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said in a press interview that the US campaign in Afghanistan had failed and Washington needs to withdraw troops. He added that Moscow strongly opposes the plan to replace the regular US military forces in Afghanistan with military contractors.\n\nOn Thursday, the deputy head of the Russian upper house Committee for International Affairs, Andrey Klimov, told reporters that Kabulov's statement was a sign that Moscow intended to use political and diplomatic leverage to prevent further spreading of US military presence.\n\n\"A US-led military intervention has been taking place for 16 years, right near the CIS borders. And considering the fact that the borders within the CIS are transparent this means that this is happening right near our borders,\" Klimov said in comments with Vzglyad internet daily. The CIS is the Commonwealth of Independent States - a Russia-led political and economic bloc of former Soviet republics.\n\n\"In recent years this has borne no resemblance to an anti-terrorist operation and looks more like a colonial policy, an attempt to keep the US military contingent there at any cost,\" he added.\n\nThe senator also noted that previously Russia has approved of the military operation conducted by the US and its NATO allies in Afghanistan, and even provided assistance to this operation, but this position has been reconsidered because of the deterioration of Russia-US relations and also because the operation in Afghanistan has failed to yield any positive results.\n\n\"Quite some time ago is became clear that the anti-terrorist operation conducted by the US and NATO in Afghanistan is ineffective, but in the course of this operation the flow of illegal drugs into Russia has increased many-fold, according to some estimations even 100-fold,\" he said.\n\n\"All this calls for a reaction and the first statements made on the subject reveal that Russia intends to use political and diplomatic means to prevent this gray spreading of the US military presence in Afghanistan,\" the senator concluded.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 163, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military"},

Experts disagree on whether the current or potential future terrorist threat justifies continuing to spend American blood and treasure in the war-torn country where the Taliban is going from strength-to-strength. The strategy developed to turn things around, which includes increasing the number of U.S. forces by several thousand, is far from perfect. Aggressively pursuing a peace deal with the Taliban or simply playing for time are also unappealing options. As bad as these and other possible options are, however, one is far worse: hiring mercenaries to do the job of U.S. troops.\n\nThere are currently 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Approximately two thousand of them conduct counterterrorism operations against Islamic State militants and other international terrorists. The rest are assigned to the Operation Resolute Support, where they -- along with another approximately six thousand troops from other countries -- train, advise and assist Afghan forces fighting against the Taliban. The United States already outsources many support missions in Afghanistan. Now, Blackwater founder Erik Prince and DynCorp International owner Stephen A. Feinberg have concocted a plan for 5,500 private contractors to take over the train, advise and assist mission. According to Prince, the plan would also include a ninety-plane private air force to provide air support to Afghan forces.\n\nThe Pentagon hates the plan. So do heavy-hitters on the Hill, like Sen. Lindsay Graham, who has pledged to fight Trump at every turn if he endorses the proposal. National Security Advisor McMaster is not a fan either. So why is Prince's idea still getting a hearing? Two reasons. First, Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, is chummy with Prince and likes his proposal. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is enamored with the idea as well, according to USA Today. Second, the president appears desperate to avoid any strategy that even vaguely resembles Obama's approach to Afghanistan. For all the ways in which he likes to live dangerously, Trump also seems reluctant to accept the risks that come with making a decision about what to do in the war-torn country. Out-of-the-box thinking about Afghanistan is welcome, but this plan never should have gotten to the president's desk.\n\nOne of Prince's main selling points is that contractors are cheaper than U.S. troops. The United States could save money while continuing to support the war effort against the Taliban, or so the argument goes. Contractors do not enjoy the same support systems as U.S. troops and so they cost less on paper. However, without proper oversight, which would be almost impossible to conduct from afar, the government would not be able to guard against waste, fraud and abuse. At best, outsourcing the war effort would save some money. But there are other costs that would be damaging to U.S. interests.\n\nThere is no reason to think a contracted force would be any more effective than the current Operation Resolute Support and plenty of reasons why it likely would be worse. As my colleague Phil Carter observed, the evidence from Afghanistan and Iraq indicates that contractors fared no better than troops when it came to advising foreign forces. However, because they operate outside of the military chain of command, it is much harder to hold them accountable. Firing a military officer ends his or her career. A contractor who is let go can move on to another private-security company. That's the nature of being a mercenary.\n\nIt gets worse. Research tells us that turning contractors loose in a failing state like Afghanistan is a recipe for greater and more indiscriminate violence that could benefit the Taliban-led insurgency. Because the United States is prohibited by law from employing contractors to serve in a military combat role Prince wants to place them under Title 50, which governs classified operations. This would make it much more difficult to hold accountable any contractors who commit crimes and seriously hamper congressional oversight.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100, "id": 287, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302950", "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303322", "label": {"eng": "Counter-terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303353", "label": {"eng": "Afghan National Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304254", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304332", "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305157", "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324819", "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "332605", "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "343065", "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349055", "label": {"eng": "Private military company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "349738", "label": {"eng": "Australian Defence Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "389097", "label": {"eng": "Close air support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Feinberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "470132", "label": {"eng": "Steve Feinberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Prince", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "506624", "label": {"eng": "Erik Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynCorp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "529987", "label": {"eng": "DynCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_Support_Mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1277132", "label": {"eng": "Resolute Support Mission"}}]}

More than 2.5 million Afghans have fled -- the second largest refugee population after Syria's.\n\nHossaini's oldest son, Khadim, was 10 years old when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He went on to study computer science and earn a degree, but these days he is searching for work.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nKhadim's younger sisters, Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. Najiba studied information technology and was eventually hired by the Petroleum Ministry, which sent her to Japan to earn a master's degree.\n\nBut as the Hossainis pursued their dreams, Afghanistan remained mired in conflict. The Taliban have expanded their reach across much of the country, where they compete with increasingly powerful warlords. Corruption is rife, and the economy is in ruins.\n\nMaryam, who is studying computer science in Kabul, said her sister had considered staying in Japan, fearful of the growing unrest. But Najiba eventually returned, only to have her improbable journey ended by a suicide bomber, who rammed his car into a bus full of Petroleum Ministry employees on July 31.\n\n\"All my dreams for my country, for my children, died with Najiba,\" said Hossaini.\n\nMaryam recalls racing from hospital to hospital until finally she found what remained of her sister -- a hand and a leg. She recognized her sister's engagement ring, which Najiba's fiance had given her after making two trips to their rural home in the Daikhundi province to convince her parents he was good enough to marry their accomplished daughter.\n\n\"Every day someone is dying. Who can live in Afghanistan without wondering if they will be the next to be killed?\" Maryam said. \"We have only one hope now in Afghanistan, and that hope is just to survive.\"\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nAndrew Wilder, vice president of the United States Institute for Peace's Asia program, said Afghanistan's young were the greatest benefactor of a post-Taliban \"bubble economy\" generated by international aid as well as opium trafficking.\n\n\"High-paying jobs were relatively plentiful for bright young Afghans with English language and computer skills,\" he said.\n\nThose opportunities dwindled as the security situation worsened, and the bubble finally burst after 2014, when the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission. Aid organizations also scaled back efforts in response to the growing chaos and the need to address other global crises, including in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe deterioration has fueled a \"growing sense of hopelessness and despair\" that has led many Afghans to flee, Wilder said.\n\nAfghanistan's deputy minister of youth affairs, Kamal Sadat, sees a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We had a golden chance to change things with all the money which came in,\" he said. \"We didn't use those opportunities the way we should have.\"\n\nHe said more attention was paid to building schools and universities than to staffing them with quality teachers. Nowadays many Afghans have turned to private institutions instead.\n\nMany young people say they know of someone who has left and that they would do the same if they had the means.\n\nShaban Hamraz works in a local grocery store, but the 19-year-old says he hopes to leave Kabul for Iran or Turkey. Three friends recently headed to neighboring Iran, and Hamraz has heard that some smugglers charge as little as $1,400 for the crossing.\n\nOf those who remain, many refuse to attend school or pursue other opportunities because of the violence.\n\n\"In just one month, three attacks in Afghanistan killed almost 100 people,\" said Ahmad Riaz, an 18-year-old high school graduate. \"I have no heart to go out of the house.\"\n\nAn Afghan man, who asked not to be named because he works for a foreign organization and fears Taliban retribution, said he sent his entire family to live in Turkey last year after a Taliban assault on the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where his son was a student.\n\nHe recalls watching the bodies being carried away from the campus as he fearfully awaited word on his son. He finally emerged unharmed at 4 a.m. He says he kept his family in Afghanistan through decades of war and instability, but now he believes it's too dangerous for them.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still pockets of hope.\n\nMahal Wak was in the vicinity of the blast that killed Najiba, and recalls the screaming, the shrapnel and the bodies. \"I was in a bad condition,\" the 17-year-old said. \"But all I could think of at the time was to help the wounded, the children.\"\n\nShe's determined to remain in the country, and to continue working as a model for traditional embroidered Afghan clothing. \"If (the Taliban) think this is wrong that is their mistake. We are sharing our culture,\" she said.\n\nHer employer, Ajmal Haqiqi, who hails from the restive Ghazni province, said he exhibits and markets the traditional clothing in hopes of preserving Afghanistan's 5,000-year-old culture.\n\n\"I think if I die here or somewhere else, does it matter?\" he said. \"I love my country.\"\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302976", "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303062", "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303634", "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307408", "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "320559", "label": {"eng": "Opium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "326817", "label": {"eng": "Pashtun people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "332764", "label": {"eng": "Demography of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349602", "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University_of_Afghanistan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "573670", "label": {"eng": "American University of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

The country's President instructed relevant officials to hold a seminar in connection with reviewing Afghanistan military history book so that researchers could write articles on each chapter of the book. \"If you want to build Afghanistan, then know well this country\", President Ghani stressed, adding that it was needed to have discussion related to culture of the country and youth should further make effort in this regard.\n\nIn the ceremony, head of U.S. Institute of Peace for Afghanistan Shah Mahmoud Miakhil spoke and while appreciating the country's President, writers and cultural figures said each book had some vacuums and mistakes and the first volume of architects of homeland also had some vacuums in connection with role of women, but the vacuums have been addressed in second volume of the book.

More than 2.5 million Afghans have fled - the second largest refugee population after Syria's.\n\nHossaini's oldest son, Khadim, was 10 years old when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He went on to study computer science and earn a degree, but these days he is searching for work.\n\nKhadim's younger sisters, Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. Najiba studied information technology and was eventually hired by the Petroleum Ministry, which sent her to Japan to earn a master's degree.\n\nBut as the Hossainis pursued their dreams, Afghanistan remained mired in conflict. The Taliban have expanded their reach across much of the country, where they compete with increasingly powerful warlords. Corruption is rife, and the economy is in ruins.\n\nMaryam, who is studying computer science in Kabul, said her sister had considered staying in Japan, fearful of the growing unrest. But Najiba eventually returned, only to have her improbable journey ended by a suicide bomber, who rammed his car into a bus full of Petroleum Ministry employees on July 31.\n\n\"All my dreams for my country, for my children, died with Najiba,\" said Hossaini.\n\nMaryam recalls racing from hospital to hospital until finally she found what remained of her sister - a hand and a leg. She recognized her sister's engagement ring, which Najiba's fiance had given her after making two trips to their rural home in the Daikhundi province to convince her parents he was good enough to marry their accomplished daughter.\n\n\"Every day someone is dying. Who can live in Afghanistan without wondering if they will be the next to be killed?\" Maryam said. \"We have only one hope now in Afghanistan, and that hope is just to survive.\"\n\nAndrew Wilder, vice president of the United States Institute for Peace's Asia program, said Afghanistan's young were the greatest benefactor of a post-Taliban \"bubble economy\" generated by international aid as well as opium trafficking.\n\n\"High-paying jobs were relatively plentiful for bright young Afghans with English language and computer skills,\" he said.\n\nThose opportunities dwindled as the security situation worsened, and the bubble finally burst after 2014, when the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission. Aid organizations also scaled back efforts in response to the growing chaos and the need to address other global crises, including in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe deterioration has fueled a \"growing sense of hopelessness and despair\" that has led many Afghans to flee, Wilder said.\n\nAfghanistan's deputy minister of youth affairs, Kamal Sadat, sees a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We had a golden chance to change things with all the money which came in,\" he said. \"We didn't use those opportunities the way we should have.\"\n\nHe said more attention was paid to building schools and universities than to staffing them with quality teachers. Nowadays many Afghans have turned to private institutions instead.\n\nMany young people say they know of someone who has left and that they would do the same if they had the means.\n\nShaban Hamraz works in a local grocery store, but the 19-year-old says he hopes to leave Kabul for Iran or Turkey. Three friends recently headed to neighboring Iran, and Hamraz has heard that some smugglers charge as little as $1,400 for the crossing.\n\nOf those who remain, many refuse to attend school or pursue other opportunities because of the violence.\n\n\"In just one month, three attacks in Afghanistan killed almost 100 people,\" said Ahmad Riaz, an 18-year-old high school graduate. \"I have no heart to go out of the house.\"\n\nAn Afghan man, who asked not to be named because he works for a foreign organization and fears Taliban retribution, said he sent his entire family to live in Turkey last year after a Taliban assault on the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where his son was a student.\n\nHe recalls watching the bodies being carried away from the campus as he fearfully awaited word on his son. He finally emerged unharmed at 4 a.m. He says he kept his family in Afghanistan through decades of war and instability, but now he believes it's too dangerous for them.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still pockets of hope.\n\nMahal Wak was in the vicinity of the blast that killed Najiba, and recalls the screaming, the shrapnel and the bodies. \"I was in a bad condition,\" the 17-year-old said. \"But all I could think of at the time was to help the wounded, the children.\"\n\nShe's determined to remain in the country, and to continue working as a model for traditional embroidered Afghan clothing. \"If (the Taliban) think this is wrong that is their mistake. We are sharing our culture,\" she said.\n\nHer employer, Ajmal Haqiqi, who hails from the restive Ghazni province, said he exhibits and markets the traditional clothing in hopes of preserving Afghanistan's 5,000-year-old culture.\n\n\"I think if I die here or somewhere else, does it matter?\" he said. \"I love my country.\"\n\n----\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc", "id": "107"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302976", "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303062", "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303634", "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307408", "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "320559", "label": {"eng": "Opium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "326817", "label": {"eng": "Pashtun people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "332764", "label": {"eng": "Demography of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349602", "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University_of_Afghanistan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "573670", "label": {"eng": "American University of Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

Afghanistan.\n\nThe administration is split over what stance to adopt on the longest-running war in US history.\n\nPossible plans include sending thousands more troops into the nearly 16-year conflict, or taking the opposite tack and pulling out, leaving private military contractors to help the Afghans oversee the fragile security situation.\n\n\"The president along with the vice president will meet with the national security team on Friday at Camp David to discuss the South Asia strategy,\" the White House said.\n\nTrump's generals have called the Afghan conflict a \"stalemate\" and even after years of intensive help from the US and other NATO nations, Afghanistan's security forces are still struggling to hold back an emboldened Taliban.\n\nIn an early move to address the situation, Trump gave his Pentagon chief, former general Jim Mattis, broad powers to set troop numbers.\n\nBut several months later, the level remains stuck at about 8,400 US and about 5,000 NATO troops, mainly serving in a training and advisory capacity.\n\nMattis wants to wait until the White House has come up with a coherent strategy for not just Afghanistan but the broader region, notably Pakistan and how it deals with terror groups, before he commits to adjustments.\n\nBut reports have suggested that other Trump advisers, including his influential strategy chief Steve Bannon, favor cutting American losses by pulling out or sending private military contractors to replace troops.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100,

Each wounded warrior was medically evacuated from the battlefield in Afghanistan to hospitals in the U.S. and Germany.\n\nThe group included dual master's degree holders, a Harvard graduate, motivational speakers and a Medal of Honor recipient. Each veteran had deployed to Afghanistan in the early years of the war and had been personally impacted by the mission to rebuild the country.\n\n\"Yours was an incredibly selfless and honorable act which has earned you the eternal gratitude of all of your fellow citizens,\" said Gen. John Nicholson, commander, Resolute Support.\n\nOperation Proper Exit offers a chance for injured service members to get closure and a unique opportunity to witness first-hand the progress in Afghanistan that they helped bring about.\n\n\"Your sacrifice is incredibly important. The stakes are high. If we fail in Afghanistan, we will invite terror attacks on our homelands and embolden jihadists globally. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces are delivering on the mission which you began,\" Nicholson said.\n\nAfter Nicholson's remarks, each veteran shared their story of their life after their injuries, and why it was important for them to come back to Afghanistan. In the years since the veterans were evacuated, each have had to focus on their recovery, but they wanted to come back for closure.\n\n\"Every thought I had was how to return to Afghanistan as quickly as possible ... I think about Afghanistan every day,\" said Sgt. 1st Class (Ret.) Joe Healey.\n\nHealey was on his ninth deployment when he sustained serious injuries a helicopter accident in October 2005.\n\n\"I am very grateful to be here again and see the beautiful faces and the great terrain in the country of Afghanistan,\" said Sgt. 1st Class (Ret.) Joe Healey.\n\nHealey also spoke about his invisible scars and personal battles with reintegrating to society as his physical condition deteriorated.\n\n\"All of coalition forces represented here today have an important role in making a difference in the fight,\" Healey said.\n\nThe wounded warriors' visit comes at a significant moment in the history of Afghanistan, as the coalition forces have moved from a frontline position to a train, advise, and assist mission, according to Col.

The job of about a dozen soldiers is to protect just two international advisers on their way to meet Afghan soldiers.\n\nWhile every mission varies, for every adviser deployed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led multinational force, many more soldiers are tasked with providing security and support.\n\nThe minimum security requirements mean that providing even just a few thousand advisers for Afghan security forces is a monumental task that, if continued, will keep many thousands more international troops and contractors facing daily threats.\n\nThat calculus will factor into arguments put before U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday as he and advisers meet ahead of a long-awaited decision on strategy and troop levels for the United States' longest war.\n\nFewer than 25 percent of coalition troops in Afghanistan are dedicated advisers - with the rest either in a security, support or a combined role.\n\nThe need to balance the force with more advisers is a driving factor behind the military's request for more troops, which has met with scepticism in Washington, where Trump was elected on a platform of reducing American commitments overseas.\n\nDANGEROUS JOB\n\nProviding security and support for the advising mission can be a deceptively dangerous job, with hours of quiet routine that can be broken by deadly violence at any moment.\n\nOn Aug. 2, two American soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomb as they were providing security for a convoy in the southern province of Kandahar.\n\nThe next day, a Georgian soldier was killed when a coalition convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul.\n\nAnd just two days after that, Romanian soldiers providing security for advisers in Kandahar were forced to shoot and kill an Afghan policeman who attacked the international troops.\n\nFor the soldiers of the British army's Royal Irish Regiment in Kabul, this \"taxi and bodyguard service\" is a far cry from their last deployment to Afghanistan when they battled militants in Helmand province in 2011.\n\n\"We're there in the background if anything happens,\" said ranger Riley Tolliday, describing his job as a \"guardian angel\" escorting advisers to meetings around the Afghan capital.\n\nAfter months of relative calm, since April the Royal Irish Regiment has deployed a \"quick reaction force\" to at least three attacks in the city, said Major Paul Martin, a company commander.\n\nIn April, the regiment's soldiers were deployed to mediate a dispute that arose after a vehicle carrying foreign troops was involved in a traffic accident and was fired upon by Afghan police.\n\nIn early May, the soldiers escorted the disabled vehicles of an U.S. military convoy that had been struck by a suicide bomber, killing eight Afghan bystanders and wounding three Americans.\n\nAnd on May 31, they responded to the scene of a massive truck bomb that detonated in the centre of Kabul, killing at least 92 people.\n\nThe British soldiers helped secure the scene and then evacuated casualties from the German embassy, which was heavily damaged.\n\nMORE ADVISERS NEED MORE PROTECTION\n\nEven at the height of the international military mission in Afghanistan, a large proportion of troops was involved behind the scenes providing security and other support for the main mission.\n\nOf the 12,447 troops from 39 countries that make up the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, about 2,865 are classified as advisers, according to numbers provided by the coalition.\n\nAnother 7,766 are considered \"enablers\", which can range from logistics and security troops to fighter aircraft pilots.\n\nAnd, finally, 1,816 are deployed as \"command and control\".\n\nAmong the enablers plus command-and-control troops, many also have part-time roles advising Afghan counterparts, but the numbers reveal the massive number of supporting troops needed to field even a limited advising mission.\n\nAmong the 23,500 private contractors also employed by the U.S. military in Afghanistan, only 800 are classified as trainers, according to the Pentagon.\n\nErik Prince, the high-profile founder of the private security firm Blackwater, has proposed using contractors to take over all of the foreign mission in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the U.S. military has used contractors to buttress the force in Afghanistan, including using private guards for security around some bases, officials say they hope to reduce overall reliance on contractors by deploying more troops.\n\nThe command in Kabul is now waiting on the stalled request for thousands more American troops, which they hope will allow them to deploy more soldiers dedicated to working with the Afghans, but also a \"significant\" number to provide more security, said one senior military official.\n\nSecurity services have seen a recent increase in demand as advisers try to reach more Afghan units, Martin said.\n\n\"We're able to fulfil about 80 percent of the requests we receive.\" The troops tasked with escorting the advisers on their missions have to not only provide protection from potential militants, but also from so-called insider attacks by members of the Afghan security forces, who have occasionally turned on their foreign allies.

Security on Independence day: Delhi-UP border to be sealed from Monday nightMy India Has ChangedThe too late nation\n\nIndia celebrates her 70th year of independence alongside the confidence and strength to project power more than ever before. This for Afghanistan is cause for jubilation. For us Afghans, India is not only a country and an ancient civilization but a contemporary brand too. An iconic brand representing diversity, tolerance, culture, humility, deep knowledge amid humility and a sincere friend.\n\nIndia is a byword in every Afghan household when it comes to matters of energy, higher education, rural development, medicine, medical tourism, food, TV dramas, and of course Bollywood. The advent of cinema in Afghanistan from the very beginning has been synonymous with Indian actors, actresses and movie songs. Afghans used to, and perhaps still do, associate themselves with the age and era of Bollywood stars and the themes and issues of their movies. This is not due to lack of alternatives or options, but because of the vast similarities between our peoples.\n\nDuring the 1980s, after the invasion of Afghanistan by the former Soviet Union, we were incentivized to watch Soviet movies, but the effort failed. Bollywood continued to play a dominant role in our lives. The rise and fall of Indian film stars continue to make headlines in Afghanistan. All India Radio's Dari programme was most popular both in urban and rural Afghanistan, prior to the cyber revolution.\n\nIndia's post-Independence magic has been the unity of her 'Amars, Akbars and Anthonys.' All her children found their home, and under one ceiling embraced their lost mother, while retaining and celebrating their diversity of beliefs and skills. They were all synced to one script and sang 'Jai Hind !'\n\nWe have learned and continue to learn a lot from India, but the best lesson we can learn from India is the lesson and experience of diversity under one ceiling and deep attachment to the idea of one soil, one country and several identities in one nationality.\n\nMany thousands of Afghans who have studied in India and continue to pursue their higher studies return home with the experience of radically diverse - and possible divisive - issues such as race, language, rights of constituents, state legitimacy , rule of law, history and best practices to contribute to the rebuilding of their nation and country. In India they learn the art of contribution, peaceful struggle, to do more with less and the ability to master obstacles through endurance, devotion and humility.\n\nIndia discovered the number Zero which is hardly appreciated worldwide, but the fact is that we can't live without it for a day. India's relevance in our lives is as vivid as her various discoveries during the course of history.\n\nThe venom of partition in 1947 created a physical distance between our two countries but with modern ways of connectivity we have been able to come closer than ever before. India's relationship with Afghanistan has been based on the principle of care and share, a development partnership without caveats and unconditional support for democratic and constitutional process.\n\nAs we see it from here, strengthening the state-to-state relationship is the core pillar of India's bilateral relationship with Afghanistan. Based on this valued and cherished principle India declined to minimize her relationship with the Afghan government in 1996 when Kabul was overrun and captured by the Pakistan-backed Taliban, Al-Qaeda, JUI (Jamiat Ulema Islam) & other militant groups.\n\nIt set a precedent in the post-Soviet era that sheer force and violence shouldn't dictate the fate of multi ethnic and diverse societies and that proxy wars should face and result in a dead end. With India's political and meagre financial assistance, the anti Taliban resistance continued to hold on and thus prevent Afghanistan becoming a de-facto colony of Pakistan through creeping invasion.\n\nThat slice of history, from 1996-2001, known as the era of resistance in Afghanistan, evolved around the sacrifices of the Afghan people who defended their unique identity and rejected Pakistan-backed religious dogmatism and militancy. It is yet another hallmark of our shared vision for peace & security and standing against injustice and domination.\n\nUnlike what is sometimes propagated India has never asked Afghanistan to be her ally against others, has encouraged and supported an Afghanistan-owned peace settlement and has shown visible and solid respect to the diversity and fabric of Afghan society.\n\nIndia's respect for Afghanistan has generated reciprocal respect. Thus, India remains the most liked and favored country throughout Afghanistan. India has become richer, stronger and far more confident and is assuming its rightful & historic place in the region. We dream to assume our rightful place in the region as well.\n\nAfghanistan has indeed been a crossroad of civilizations and cultures. We are mindful and cherish our Buddhist, Zoarastarian, Hindu and Islamic heritage. The divergence and congregation of all these magnificent civilizations in Afghanistan has not been a coincidence of history. Our location served as an unavoidable magnet for connectivity, divergence of civilizations & settlement of ideas. We want to get back to our roots and resist the axe that wants to divide us Afghans. Much before the dark era of the Taliban or the Cold War, we are searching for and want to revive our historic roots as well.\n\nIn this endeavor, India can do far more with and for Afghanistan. Afghanistan in not in search of a new identity. We are defending an identity that some in our neighborhood have tried to snatch from us, corrupt and belittle us with madrassa-born ideologies. We, however, are confident that we will prevail in this conquest.\n\nAfghanistan is not offering itself as an ally to one power against the other. It is trying to emerge as a contributor to peace andvsecurity in the region and not as a spoiler or a launching pad for one neighbour against the other. Afghanistan's potential remains unexploited and unopened. We are looking to transform from being a country dependent on foreign aid and susceptible to the dark influence of our neighbors, to a hub of friendship, connectivity, trade, tourism & tolerance. It may seem a distant dream but we are moving steadily towards that direction. That has been our status in the past.\n\nWe want to change today's reality. Today much of Afghanistan's fresh fruits rot in storages or in the back of trucks, as every year Pakistan closes its border for our produce and denies us land access to India. On the other hand India is ready to buy all our fresh agriculture produce. An air corridor was recently established between Kabul and Delhi to solve the problem. Our restricted access to Karachi port pushed us to find alternatives and today Afghanistan is linked to more ports than it has ever been.\n\nToday we are a land-linked country, not a landlocked one. But for the new realities and for us to utilize them properly, more time and adaptability is needed.

There had been strong speculation the policy would be released at the NATO summit in late May, but it has yet to be finalized. U.S. commanders have said the military situation has ground to a \"stalemate.\"\n\nThe White House says Trump plans to meet Friday with his security team and Vice President Mike Pence at Camp David to examine the options, which range from a troop surge, as requested by General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to a complete pullout. Other options include turning over the mission to private contractors.\n\nForced out of power by the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban has remained a destabilizing force in the international effort to foster reconstruction in a country plagued by extremism. The group is an important player that can't be overlooked, but it has failed to come to the negotiating table, instead pursuing attacks and intimidation, while increasing the territory that it holds over the past year.\n\n\"If you failed to win the Afghan war with disciplined U.S. and NATO troops, advanced technology, experienced military generals, consecutive strategies and mighty economy, you shall never be able to win it with mercenaries, notorious contractor firms and immoral stooges,\" said the Taliban letter.\n\nAimal Faizi, spokesman of former president Hamid Karzai, questioned the Taliban's authority and aims. He said the letter won't make any impact on U.S. strategy.\n\n\"On Afghanistan, Washington certainly has long-term plans and strategies,\" Faizi said.\" All the president does is choose from the available options to him. Trump is not going to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. So the letter... will not change anything in the White House.\"\n\nTrump has taken a tougher stance toward terrorism, and his administration has continued pressure on Pakistan to eliminate the Haqqanis. This seems to have pressured the Taliban, and the letter might be a tactic to ease the heat, said Khadim Hussain, a political analyst based in Peshawar.\n\n\"It certainly is a tactic to counter the pressure being built on the security establishment of Pakistan,\" Hussein said.\n\nSami Yousufzai, a journalist with The Daily Beast, agrees. \"In fact, the U.S. nowadays is pumping Pakistan to take solid action against the Haqqnai network,\" he said.\"To ease growing pressure, the Taliban have sent a letter to Trump, just to show they are not insane killers, but in reality, the Taliban are preparing for killing and bloodshed in Afghanistan in coming months.\"\n\nIn the seven months since Trump took office, the policy that terrorism must be eradicated, wherever it is, has remained firm.\n\nSadiq Sadique, director of the Media and Information Center Afghanistan, tweeted the Taliban and their supporters are trying to sound reasonable because they dread Trump's focus coming fully on them.\n\n\"The Taliban and their backers are afraid of him; they know he will be serious and will go after them and their backers,\" he wrote.\n\nTrump also has shown frustration over the length of the Afghan war, and the country's endemic corruption has caused other frustrations.\n\nAccording to a report from the U.S. Special Inspector General for the Reconstruction of Afghanistan, territory under the Afghan government's control diminished significantly in 2016 as the Taliban made large gains.\n\nAbout 8,400 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, training, advising and assisting local forces under a NATO-led military coalition, in addition to conducting counterterrorism operations.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pesh\u0101war"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pesh\u0101war"}, "type": "loc", "id": "48347"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}, "type": "loc", "id": "285692"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304965", "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308026", "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "322022", "label": {"eng": "Hamid Karzai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322596", "label": {"eng": "Endemism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323851", "label": {"eng": "International Security Assistance Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "333031", "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haqqani_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "353087", "label": {"eng": "Haqqani network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet\u2013Afghan_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1118979", "label": {"eng": "Soviet\u2013Afghan War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u201314)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1167189", "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)"}}]}

More than 2.5 million Afghans have fled -- the second largest refugee population after Syria's.\n\nHossaini's oldest son, Khadim, was 10 years old when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He went on to study computer science and earn a degree, but these days he is searching for work.\n\nKhadim's younger sisters, Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. Najiba studied information technology and was eventually hired by the Petroleum Ministry, which sent her to Japan to earn a master's degree.\n\nBut as the Hossainis pursued their dreams, Afghanistan remained mired in conflict. The Taliban have expanded their reach across much of the country, where they compete with increasingly powerful warlords. Corruption is rife, and the economy is in ruins.\n\nMaryam, who is studying computer science in Kabul, said her sister had considered staying in Japan, fearful of the growing unrest. But Najiba eventually returned, only to have her improbable journey ended by a suicide bomber, who rammed his car into a bus full of Petroleum Ministry employees on July 31.\n\n\"All my dreams for my country, for my children, died with Najiba,\" said Hossaini.\n\nMaryam recalls racing from hospital to hospital until finally she found what remained of her sister -- a hand and a leg. She recognized her sister's engagement ring, which Najiba's fiance had given her after making two trips to their rural home in the Daikhundi province to convince her parents he was good enough to marry their accomplished daughter.\n\n\"Every day someone is dying. Who can live in Afghanistan without wondering if they will be the next to be killed?\" Maryam said. \"We have only one hope now in Afghanistan, and that hope is just to survive.\"\n\nAndrew Wilder, vice president of the United States Institute for Peace's Asia program, said Afghanistan's young were the greatest benefactor of a post-Taliban \"bubble economy\" generated by international aid as well as opium trafficking.\n\n\"High-paying jobs were relatively plentiful for bright young Afghans with English language and computer skills,\" he said.\n\nThose opportunities dwindled as the security situation worsened, and the bubble finally burst after 2014, when the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission. Aid organizations also scaled back efforts in response to the growing chaos and the need to address other global crises, including in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe deterioration has fueled a \"growing sense of hopelessness and despair\" that has led many Afghans to flee, Wilder said.\n\nAfghanistan's deputy minister of youth affairs, Kamal Sadat, sees a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We had a golden chance to change things with all the money which came in,\" he said. \"We didn't use those opportunities the way we should have.\"\n\nHe said more attention was paid to building schools and universities than to staffing them with quality teachers. Nowadays many Afghans have turned to private institutions instead.\n\nMany young people say they know of someone who has left and that they would do the same if they had the means.\n\nShaban Hamraz works in a local grocery store, but the 19-year-old says he hopes to leave Kabul for Iran or Turkey. Three friends recently headed to neighboring Iran, and Hamraz has heard that some smugglers charge as little as $1,400 for the crossing.\n\nOf those who remain, many refuse to attend school or pursue other opportunities because of the violence.\n\n\"In just one month, three attacks in Afghanistan killed almost 100 people,\" said Ahmad Riaz, an 18-year-old high school graduate. \"I have no heart to go out of the house.\"\n\nAn Afghan man, who asked not to be named because he works for a foreign organization and fears Taliban retribution, said he sent his entire family to live in Turkey last year after a Taliban assault on the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where his son was a student.\n\nHe recalls watching the bodies being carried away from the campus as he fearfully awaited word on his son. He finally emerged unharmed at 4 a.m. He says he kept his family in Afghanistan through decades of war and instability, but now he believes it's too dangerous for them.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still pockets of hope.\n\nMahal Wak was in the vicinity of the blast that killed Najiba, and recalls the screaming, the shrapnel and the bodies. \"I was in a bad condition,\" the 17-year-old said. \"But all I could think of at the time was to help the wounded, the children.\"\n\nShe's determined to remain in the country, and to continue working as a model for traditional embroidered Afghan clothing. \"If (the Taliban) think this is wrong that is their mistake.

More than 2.5 million Afghans have fled -- the second largest refugee population after Syria's.\n\nHossaini's oldest son, Khadim, was 10 years old when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He went on to study computer science and earn a degree, but these days he is searching for work.\n\nKhadim's younger sisters, Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. Najiba studied information technology and was eventually hired by the Petroleum Ministry, which sent her to Japan to earn a master's degree.\n\nBut as the Hossainis pursued their dreams, Afghanistan remained mired in conflict. The Taliban have expanded their reach across much of the country, where they compete with increasingly powerful warlords. Corruption is rife, and the economy is in ruins.\n\nMaryam, who is studying computer science in Kabul, said her sister had considered staying in Japan, fearful of the growing unrest. But Najiba eventually returned, only to have her improbable journey ended by a suicide bomber, who rammed his car into a bus full of Petroleum Ministry employees on July 31.\n\n\"All my dreams for my country, for my children, died with Najiba,\" said Hossaini.\n\nMaryam recalls racing from hospital to hospital until finally she found what remained of her sister -- a hand and a leg. She recognized her sister's engagement ring, which Najiba's fiance had given her after making two trips to their rural home in the Daikhundi province to convince her parents he was good enough to marry their accomplished daughter.\n\n\"Every day someone is dying. Who can live in Afghanistan without wondering if they will be the next to be killed?\" Maryam said. \"We have only one hope now in Afghanistan, and that hope is just to survive.\"\n\nAndrew Wilder, vice president of the United States Institute for Peace's Asia program, said Afghanistan's young were the greatest benefactor of a post-Taliban \"bubble economy\" generated by international aid as well as opium trafficking.\n\n\"High-paying jobs were relatively plentiful for bright young Afghans with English language and computer skills,\" he said.\n\nThose opportunities dwindled as the security situation worsened, and the bubble finally burst after 2014, when the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission. Aid organizations also scaled back efforts in response to the growing chaos and the need to address other global crises, including in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe deterioration has fueled a \"growing sense of hopelessness and despair\" that has led many Afghans to flee, Wilder said.\n\nAfghanistan's deputy minister of youth affairs, Kamal Sadat, sees a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We had a golden chance to change things with all the money which came in,\" he said. \"We didn't use those opportunities the way we should have.\"\n\nHe said more attention was paid to building schools and universities than to staffing them with quality teachers. Nowadays many Afghans have turned to private institutions instead.\n\nMany young people say they know of someone who has left and that they would do the same if they had the means.\n\nShaban Hamraz works in a local grocery store, but the 19-year-old says he hopes to leave Kabul for Iran or Turkey. Three friends recently headed to neighboring Iran, and Hamraz has heard that some smugglers charge as little as $1,400 for the crossing.\n\nOf those who remain, many refuse to attend school or pursue other opportunities because of the violence.\n\n\"In just one month, three attacks in Afghanistan killed almost 100 people,\" said Ahmad Riaz, an 18-year-old high school graduate. \"I have no heart to go out of the house.\"\n\nAn Afghan man, who asked not to be named because he works for a foreign organization and fears Taliban retribution, said he sent his entire family to live in Turkey last year after a Taliban assault on the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where his son was a student.\n\nHe recalls watching the bodies being carried away from the campus as he fearfully awaited word on his son.

Pakistan's support to the Afghan-led peace process is critical and it goes without saying that peace in Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Afghanistan are victims of terror and this menace cannot be completely uprooted until there is meaningful coordination and collaboration between the two countries. Sadly, the track record of Pak-Afghan cooperation has been poor. Leaders of both countries have been accusing each other of carrying out selective action against militants and playing double games. It is about time we addressed the issue at hand rather than indulge in more rhetoric.\n\nWhile Pakistan's pledge to collaborate with Afghanistan is laudable, we should also come clean on allegations of differentiating between the good and bad Taliban. As a matter of fact, Pakistan's policy vis-\u00e0-vis terrorism had been flawed in the past with the military only acting against groups that targeted Pakistan and sparing those that use the country's soil to launch attacks in other countries. But we did see a shift in that long-held policy after the country's leadership decided to form a new anti-terror plan in the wake of Army Public School (APS) attack.\n\nIf Pakistan is acting against all groups of terrorists indiscriminately in Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, it ought to respond to the allegations of differentiating between 'good and bad Taliban' by highlighting as to what action was taken against groups such as the Haqqani network that were previously considered as the state's\n\nstrategic assets.\n\nAfghanistan should also act responsibly and refrain from blaming Pakistan after every terror attack. The Afghan leadership should also address Pakistan's grievances about supporting terrorists such as the groups that refer to themselves as the Pakistan Taliban. Both countries need to talk to each other on a regular basis. Pakistan and Afghanistan must realise that it is the time to unite against the common enemy.

That undermines the Afghan population and also the Afghan government,\" said US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert.\n\nIn the report it has been noted that Afghanistan's non-Muslim minorities such the Sikhs, Hindus and Christians have also complained about discrimination and mistreatment in society.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "2"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Sar-e Pul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sar-e_Pol_Province", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wil\u0101yat-e Sar-e Pul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47294"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47507"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Her\u0101t"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Her\u0101t"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47543"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valdaora"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olang", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valdaora"}, "type": "loc", "id": "153173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303023", "label": {"eng": "Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303094", "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303326", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303327", "label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303355", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304451", "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305935", "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309620", "label": {"eng": "Caliphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309898", "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Assistance_Mission_in_Afghanistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "422137", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Khorasan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "485830", "label": {"eng": "Greater Khorasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Independent_Human_Rights_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "502662", "label": {"eng": "Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Samar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "1153426", "label": {"eng": "Sima Samar"}}]}

More than 2.5 million Afghans have fled - the second largest refugee population after Syria's.\n\nIn this Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017 photo, Maryam Hossaini, left, whose sister Najiba was killed in a suicide attack last month, looks at a poster showing her sister during an interview with The Associated Press, in Kabul, Afghanistan. Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. (AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)\n\nHossaini's oldest son, Khadim, was 10 years old when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. He went on to study computer science and earn a degree, but these days he is searching for work.\n\nKhadim's younger sisters, Najiba and Maryam, were part of the first generation of Afghan women to attend school after the fall of the Taliban, who had outlawed women's education. Najiba studied information technology and was eventually hired by the Petroleum Ministry, which sent her to Japan to earn a master's degree.\n\nBut as the Hossainis pursued their dreams, Afghanistan remained mired in conflict. The Taliban have expanded their reach across much of the country, where they compete with increasingly powerful warlords. Corruption is rife, and the economy is in ruins.\n\nMaryam, who is studying computer science in Kabul, said her sister had considered staying in Japan, fearful of the growing unrest. But Najiba eventually returned, only to have her improbable journey ended by a suicide bomber, who rammed his car into a bus full of Petroleum Ministry employees on July 31.\n\n\"All my dreams for my country, for my children, died with Najiba,\" said Hossaini.\n\nMaryam recalls racing from hospital to hospital until finally she found what remained of her sister - a hand and a leg. She recognized her sister's engagement ring, which Najiba's fiance had given her after making two trips to their rural home in the Daikhundi province to convince her parents he was good enough to marry their accomplished daughter.\n\n\"Every day someone is dying. Who can live in Afghanistan without wondering if they will be the next to be killed?\" Maryam said. \"We have only one hope now in Afghanistan, and that hope is just to survive.\"\n\nAndrew Wilder, vice president of the United States Institute for Peace's Asia program, said Afghanistan's young were the greatest benefactor of a post-Taliban \"bubble economy\" generated by international aid as well as opium trafficking.\n\n\"High-paying jobs were relatively plentiful for bright young Afghans with English language and computer skills,\" he said.\n\nThose opportunities dwindled as the security situation worsened, and the bubble finally burst after 2014, when the U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission. Aid organizations also scaled back efforts in response to the growing chaos and the need to address other global crises, including in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe deterioration has fueled a \"growing sense of hopelessness and despair\" that has led many Afghans to flee, Wilder said.\n\nAfghanistan's deputy minister of youth affairs, Kamal Sadat, sees a missed opportunity.\n\n\"We had a golden chance to change things with all the money which came in,\" he said. \"We didn't use those opportunities the way we should have.\"\n\nHe said more attention was paid to building schools and universities than to staffing them with quality teachers. Nowadays many Afghans have turned to private institutions instead.\n\nMany young people say they know of someone who has left and that they would do the same if they had the means.\n\nShaban Hamraz works in a local grocery store, but the 19-year-old says he hopes to leave Kabul for Iran or Turkey. Three friends recently headed to neighboring Iran, and Hamraz has heard that some smugglers charge as little as $1,400 for the crossing.\n\nOf those who remain, many refuse to attend school or pursue other opportunities because of the violence.\n\n\"In just one month, three attacks in Afghanistan killed almost 100 people,\" said Ahmad Riaz, an 18-year-old high school graduate. \"I have no heart to go out of the house.\"\n\nAn Afghan man, who asked not to be named because he works for a foreign organization and fears Taliban retribution, said he sent his entire family to live in Turkey last year after a Taliban assault on the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, where his son was a student.\n\nHe recalls watching the bodies being carried away from the campus as he fearfully awaited word on his son. He finally emerged unharmed at 4 a.m. He says he kept his family in Afghanistan through decades of war and instability, but now he believes it's too dangerous for them.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still pockets of hope.\n\nMahal Wak was in the vicinity of the blast that killed Najiba, and recalls the screaming, the shrapnel and the bodies. \"I was in a bad condition,\" the 17-year-old said. \"But all I could think of at the time was to help the wounded, the children.\"\n\nShe's determined to remain in the country, and to continue working as a model for traditional embroidered Afghan clothing. \"If (the Taliban) think this is wrong that is their mistake. We are sharing our culture,\" she said.\n\nHer employer, Ajmal Haqiqi, who hails from the restive Ghazni province, said he exhibits and markets the traditional clothing in hopes of preserving Afghanistan's 5,000-year-old culture.\n\n\"I think if I die here or somewhere else, does it matter?\" he said. \"I love my country.\"\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.\n\nIn this Thursday, Aug. 3, 2017 photo, Maryam Hossaini, left, whose sister, Najiba, was killed in a suicide attack last month, wipes a tear during an interview with The Associated Press, in Kabul, Afghanistan.

According to official, of Herat chambers of commerce and industries, with implementation of this plan, the level of the country's exports particularly the west zone, would be increased many field. As at present according to available official data, Afghan imports are 10 pc while its exports are 10 pc.\n\nAt the same time the officials of WTC would assess Afghanistan exports problems and the way of implementation of this strategy will be paved at the end of current year. According to WTC advisor Mujeeburrahman Khatir, this strategy would improve situation of Afghanistan exports.\n\nThe officials of Herat CCI have said that there is a deep gap between imports-exports of Afghanistan, the world and the region and efforts are underway to establish balance between these two partners. They emphasize that the west zone has achieved US $250m exports to regional and world countries and this process is growing.\n\nAccording to head of Herat CCI Saad Khatibi, Afghanistan imports are several times higher. In their opinion, the reason behind not improving of Afghanistan exports are lack of government support from exporters. Afghanistan annual imports is over US $ 10b while its exports are less than US $ 600m. Afghan exports items include carpets and animal and herbal products. President Ghani has already considered imbalance of our imports- exports as the biggest threat after poverty, corruption and drugs. It is believed that the Afghan government is trying to change this country to an exporter country because many ways are already paved for most products.\n\nAccording to president Ghani, the Afghan government has managed to defend itself politically but so far she lacks economic independence and political independence is defected without autarky.\n\nThe Afghan MoCI has time and again announced that balance of imports-exports are important for Afghanistan economic development. According to MoCI, at present the most Afghanistan exports are taking place to Pakistan and India and efforts will be made to increase exports to other countries too.\n\nTo improve trade, Afghanistan has signed bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral agreements with neighboring and regional countries and efforts are going on to connect Afghanistan to regional and international waters. According to MoCI, similar agreements have been proposed to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to pave the way of Afghanistan exports improvement to these countries.\n\nAfghanistan exports mainly include, fresh and dried fruits, medicinal herbs, carpets, fur etc but it is said that the value of exports items is more than the registered data.

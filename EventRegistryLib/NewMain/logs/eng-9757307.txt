Mott has faced criticism following England's failure to defend their world titles.\n\nEngland's defence of both world titles came to a disastrous end after a horrendous campaign in India during the ODI World Cup last year. This was followed by a semi-final exit to India in the T20 World Cup 2024, as the pressure on Mott increased.\n\nAccording to reports in the British media, Mott will step down, and England has begun to interview potential successors. Morgan was one of the candidates mentioned for the role, but he promptly disregarded the suggestions. Morgan told Sky Sports, while commentating on the Hundred, that it was genuinely news to him.\n\n\"This news is actually news to me. It's obviously not nice when a coach comes under fire and there is a lot of speculation about his future, but only time will tell what will happen,\" Morgan said.\n\nMorgan said he would like to coach the team in the future when the timing is right now. The former England skipper stated that he currently has a young family and would like to spend more time with them.\n\n\"I've been asked a lot [in the media] over the past couple of months about the role, and if I would take it on. My answer has simply been that the timing for everything in my life at the moment is not right. Yes, I want to coach down the line. But I have a young family, and I spend a lot more time at home and watching cricket doing this [commentary].

In the Super 8, they managed to pull off a victory over the hosts West Indies to make it to the semi-finals. But they could not stand a chance against a strong Indian team in the semi-final as they lost the match by 68 runs.\n\nThis was not the only unsuccessful campaign with Matthew Mott as head coach. Under Mott, England had a disappointing ODI World Cup 2023 campaign last year, where they entered as defending champions.\n\nBut Jos Buttler and his men failed to qualify for the semi-finals and finished seventh in the points table with 3 wins and 6 defeats. As a result, the pressure has started mounting on Matthew Mott and Jos Buttler.\n\nAlso read: Hardik Pandya skips Suryakumar Yadav's first address to team India as their captain\n\nWhen asked about taking up the role of England's new head coach during the Hundred's commentary stint, Morgan expressed his surprise at the news and denied the rumors.\n\n\"This news is actually news to me.

These results have intensified the pressure on the current coach, Matthew Mott, with speculation rife about potential replacements.\n\nBritish media reports have suggested that Mott may leave his post, and England's cricket board has begun exploring possible candidates for the position.

Both Mott and Jos Buttler came under pressure after England won three out of nine games at the 50-over World Cup last year, two of which came after their elimination.\n\nAt the T20 World Cup, they reached the semi-finals but were thrashed by India in Guyana, and only won once in their four matches against Test-playing opposition. Rob Key, England's managing director, said he would review that tournament \"in the next few weeks\" after their elimination and that process is now underway.\n\nThe Times reported that Mott is likely to leave his role and that Key was sounding out potential candidates.

It's obviously not nice when a coach comes under fire and there is a lot of speculation about his future, but only time will tell what will happen.' Eoin Morgan expressed on the opening evening of 'The Hundred 2024'.\n\nIt was the 37-year-old himself who supported both Mott and Buttler to continue, as he remarked on having no interest in the given role due to his young family, with whom he wants to share more time, along with the broadcasting work.\n\n'I've been asked a lot [in the media] over the past couple of months about the role, and if I would take it on.

England entered both events as the defending champions but could not leave a mark, failing to progress beyond the first round in the 50-over event and bowing out in the semi-finals last month in the T20 World Cup.\n\nMott took over the white-ball sides from Chris Silverwood in 2022 for two years and led the team to the T20 World Cup in Australia that year. However, since then, performances have declined with England winning just one T20I bilateral series. They also lost ODI series' in Australia, South Africa and the West Indies.\n\nAsked on Sky Sports whether he would be eager to take over potentially from Mott, Morgan outright denied the possibility. \"I've been asked a lot over the last couple months about the role and whether I would take it on. My answer has simply been, the timing for everything in my life at the moment is not right.\n\n\"Yes, I want to coach down the line, but I've got a young family and I spend a lot more time at home. I'm loving what I'm doing, watching cricket through this.\"\n\nEarlier, Morgan had rallied around Mott and the white-ball skipper Jos Buttler, urging them to continue in their respective roles. Speaking on Wisden Cricket Monthly, he had said: \"I do think Jos and Motty should stay on. Given they came into the tournament with the least amount of expectation, they made the semi-final and you have to acknowledge that.\n\n\"You shouldn't take that for granted - it's not a given you can get there, with the likes of Australia not making it and New Zealand being knocked out in the group stage. There were various challenges other teams couldn't overcome and England did, so a lot of credit has to go to both of them in that instance.\n\n\"One thing that will be flagged is that they only beat West Indies out of the Full Member nations but, still, they managed to get to a semi-final. So, for me, Mott and Buttler stay in their positions, particularly when I don't see any obvious replacements. Giving them more time to get better and grow is the decision that should be made.\"\n\nEngland's next white-ball series is against Australia in September, where they will play three T20Is and as many ODIs.", "source": {"uri": "wisden.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wisden"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoin_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eoin Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Mott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Mott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Silverwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Silverwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Buttler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos Buttler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_women's_cricket_team_in_England_in_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia women's cricket team in England in 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers'_Almanack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.wisden.com/static-assets/waf-images/43/e1/1e/16-9/PoNjoskTys.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757307", "eventUri": "eng-9757307", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Though England reached the semifinals of the T20 World Cup, where they lost by 68 runs to India, they had to rely on Australia to beat Scotland in order to advance to the Super Eight.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports, Morgan said as quoted by ESPNCricinfo, \"This news (reports of him taking over from Mott) is actually news to me.

In 356 matches for England, he scored 10,115 runs at an average of 35.61, with 15 centuries and 59 fifties. His best score was 148. After England's humiliating group stage exit in the 2015 ODI World Cup, it was captain Morgan who rebuilt the English side with more aggressive talent like Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Alex Hales and Buttler, making up a power-packed, aggressive batting line-up that could play its flashy, attacking and high-risk game irrespective of conditions.\n\nEngland's next white-ball assignment will be a three T20I and five ODI series against Australia in September.

After England's humiliating group stage exit in the 2015 ODI World Cup, it was captain Morgan who rebuilt the English side with more aggressive talent like Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Alex Hales and Buttler, making up a power-packed, aggressive batting line-up that could play its flashy, attacking and high-risk game irrespective of conditions.\n\nEngland's next white-ball assignment will be a three T20I and five ODI series against Australia in September.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Buttler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos Buttler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Hales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Hales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/16/1600x900/Cricket_1713260878026_1713260990583.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757307", "eventUri": "eng-9757307", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Ultimately, he has ended up as one of the coaches of The Hundred franchises, I'm sure with half an eye on building him towards being an international coach in the future.\"\n\nWith Buttler also expected to leave his position, Key will probably have to appoint an interim option anyway as the captain is likely to be injured for September's one-day and T20 home series.\n\nOne option would be to appoint Moeen Ali, the current vice-captain, for those two series and the November tour of the West Indies.\n\nHowever, a younger interim such as Sam Curran might be preferable.\n\nFor the Champions Trophy in Pakistan next February and March, choosing a new captain would be more complicated.\n\nHarry Brook could feasibly be handed the white-ball job ahead of that tournament with the caveat that he might have to miss several series in the run-up to the Ashes in Australia that starts in November 2025.\n\nAnother option would be to appoint Joe Root, an experienced former England captain, just for the Champions Trophy with Brook taking on the top job after the Ashes.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

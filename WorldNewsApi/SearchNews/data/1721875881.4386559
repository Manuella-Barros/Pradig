The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Per the photos, the family of late \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin, who died in 2006, spent much of their time in the East African country outdoors. The first photo in the set featured the whole family attempting to pose for a group shot together, with Chandler, 27, Robert, 20, and Terri, 59, sitting on what appears to be a large piece of tree bark as Bindi ran after a jovial Grace, 3. They eventually were successful, per the second photo in the set, which featured mountains and a body of water in a breathtaking backdrop. Chandler and Bindi took a sweet selfie together in another slide, and Robert stood on top of the tree bark holding his arms out wide as his sister and mother posed in front of him in another photo. The family's adventures featured unpredictable terrain and weather, with Grace walking over a bridge that appeared to be covered in snow in one of the photos, as her father led the way in front of her. Being the daughter of wildlife conservationists, Grace is a friend to wildlife and no stranger to adventure.

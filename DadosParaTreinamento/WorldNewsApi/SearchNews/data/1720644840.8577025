Karl Considine, who runs Kampus-based bar Love From, has made history by opening the first non-alcoholic bar within the festival\u2019s 14-year history. It means that the 80,000 festival goers at each day of the Heaton Park festival can order themselves the likes of a Heaton Park Colada without the concern of a hangover. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on us,\u201d Karl admits to the Manchester Evening News on the first day of the festival. \u201cNot only is it a massive festival, but it\u2019s also a huge space where people are known to come and drink a lot.

These are grown up drinks, they're not just a can of pop.\u201d Getting underway today (June 8), the first day of Parklife will feature the likes of Sugababes, Becky Hill, Peggy Gou, Disclosure, Camelphat and CASISDEAD across nine live stages, with the weather bringing out a collection of bright and colourful outfits. Karl says their selection of drinks, which also include alcohol-free wines, have gone down a storm so far, and says he has served people who are not drinking whatsoever, and those who also want to limit the amount of alcohol they have through the day. He explains: \u201cSome people have told us they\u2019re doing Zebra Drinking, which is essentially where people will have an alcoholic drink, then a non-alcoholic drink like an alcohol-free cocktail or beer, to pace it out. \u201cIt\u2019s something that, in my day and age, would have been such a weird thing to do but people are alternating and it's quite a popular choice amongst young people today.\u201d Karl says he chose to come to Parklife, not solely just to break down barriers but also because it\u2019s the kind of thing he\u2019d want to go to himself. \u201cI have always been into electronic music,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn my party boy days, going to the Warehouse Project was my place to go. \u201cWith Love From, it\u2019s really important to me that we can demonstrate in places like this, where you have such strong beliefs that you have to be in a certain mindset, that it can be done. We exist to challenge perceptions, so why shouldn't there be an alcohol-free bar at Parklife?\u201d", "summary": "&quot;People have said they are glad we are here, but why shouldn\u2019t we be?&quot;", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/some-people-responded-quite-funny-29318200", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29318301.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AMR_MEN_080624_PLjpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:43:11", "author": "Adam Maidment", "authors": ["Adam Maidment"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.514}

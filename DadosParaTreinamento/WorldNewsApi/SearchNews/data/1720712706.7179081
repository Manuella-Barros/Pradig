Here are the key moments from day 18 of the campaign: \u2013 Going nowhere The Tories were quick to quash rumours that Rishi Sunak could quit as Prime Minister before polling day to allow someone else the chance to boost Conservative chances at the ballot box. Speculation about the unlikely-sounding scenario had been fuelled by former Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries, an arch-critic of the Prime Minister, who said late on Saturday there were \u201crumours around tonight that Sunak\u2019s about to fall on his sword\u201d in the wake of the D-Day row. But Cabinet minister Mel Stride, who helped run Mr Sunak\u2019s leadership campaign, said the Prime Minister would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be in place for polling day and suggested there was time for the Tories to turn around their campaign. He told Sky\u2019s Sir Trevor Phillips: \u201cTo your point about whether \u2018all is lost\u2019, we have four weeks, that\u2019s a long time in politics.\u201d \u2013 Away from the spotlight Mr Sunak himself was keeping a low profile on Sunday, away from the media, after a Saturday event at which he dodged questions from reporters. A Labour source said the Tory campaign was \u201cdescending further into farce\u201d and \u201cSunak will surely have to come out of hiding soon and explain how families can afford five more years of this madness\u201d. \u2013 New skirmish in political Battle of Normandy Nigel Farage was accused of using \u201cdog whistle\u201d tactics by claiming Rishi Sunak\u2019s early exit from the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations showed he did not understand \u201cour culture\u201d. Labour\u2019s Shabana Mahmood said his criticism of the British-Asian Prime Minister was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d while Mr Stride said it left him feeling \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d. Asked what he meant by his comments, Mr Farage told BBC1\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg that Mr Sunak \u201cis utterly disconnected by class, by privilege, from how the ordinary folk in this country feel\u201d. Meanwhile, Mr Stride suggested the Prime Minister had been hurt by the backlash to his decision to skip the international event on Omaha Beach in Normandy. \u201cI think he will be feeling this personally, very deeply because he\u2019s a deeply patriotic person. He will be deeply uncomfortable with what has happened,\u201d Mr Stride told Sky News. \u2013 No return to austerity Labour\u2019s manifesto will commit the party to not increasing income tax, national insurance or VAT despite the parlous state of the public finances. Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said both Labour and the Tories \u201cdon\u2019t really want to talk about the scale of the challenge facing them\u201d in terms of public spending. Because they had ruled out increasing \u201csimple taxes\u201d, he told Sky\u2019s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips there was a risk of ending up with \u201ccomplicated and actually quite economically damaging taxes\u201d in order to avoid spending cuts across the public sector. But on a campaign visit in Essex, Sir Keir Starmer said his priority was to raise money by growing the economy and insisted \u201cwe are not returning to austerity\u201d. \u2013 Class warfare Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry acknowledged that her party\u2019s plan to charge private schools VAT could increase class sizes in the state sector as parents switch to save money. The shadow attorney general told GB News there were spaces in her local primary and secondary schools and if the private pupils wanted to come there \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d. \u201cIf we have to, in the short term, have larger classes, we have larger classes,\u201d she said. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said that would mean Sir Keir\u2019s party \u201cpunishing children to pay for their plans\u201d, with pupils \u201cimpacted by Labour\u2019s politics of envy\u201d. \u2013 Picture of the day \u2013 Quote of the day \u2013 Social media moment Despite keeping away from press cameras, Mr Sunak posted a picture on his X feed showing him stroking a dog \u2013 which appeared to be wearing a Tory rosette \u2013 in Bedale. The North Yorkshire town was part of his constituency but boundary changes have moved it into the neighbouring Thirsk and Malton seat. \u2013 What\u2019s happening tomorrow? The Liberal Democrats will launch their manifesto at the start of a week which is also expected to see the Tories and Labour set out their promises to the nation. Mr Sunak will face Nick Robinson for a BBC Panorama special interview at 8pm. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage will lead a press conference to set out his plans for the economy.", "summary": "A senior ally was forced to dismiss speculation Rishi Sunak could quit before July 4\u2019s polling day following the backlash over his Normandy exit.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/nadine-dorries-labour-rishi-sunak-nigel-farage-prime-minister-b1163166.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/53939d1fabad0f5f9285d57da5ba4156Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDI5MTEz-2.76462289.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:35:14", "author": "David Hughes", "authors": ["David Hughes"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.362}

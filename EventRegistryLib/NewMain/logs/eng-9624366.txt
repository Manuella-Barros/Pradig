He founded the media company back in 2013.\n\nDiddy's once thought-to-be impregnable empire and reputation has been seemingly coming apart at the seams ever since November 16, 2023, when Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against the mogul accusing him of sexual assault, amongst other crimes. Although the suit was settled a day after it was filed, the damn had been broken, with multiple victims since coming forward to accuse Combs of similar abuse.\n\nInitially, Diddy vehemently denied all the claims, and he still does, save for former Bad Boy artist Ventura's. But that seems to be only because in May 2024, CNN acquired and shared footage of Diddy beating Cassie in the hall of a Los Angeles hotel back in 2016. The video of the incident confirmed what Cassie had described in her lawsuit. A video apology issue by Diddy shorty thereafter was almost universally maligned for its alleged insincerity.\n\nOn Tuesday (June 4), Revolt announced that Combs had sold his stake in the company. Prior to that, in late November 2023, Revolt shared that Diddy had stepped from his position as Chairman of the company.\n\nRevolt now boasts that it is owned by employees, and remains Black-owned. \"REVOLT is honored and proud to announce that, in an unprecedented and historic move in the Black media space, our newly projected largest shareholder group are REVOLT's current employees,\" read a statement announcing Combs' shared have been \"fully redeemed and retired.\" \"Our mission to become the largest media company powered by creators and fueled by the culture continues.\"\n\nThe New York Times reports that Detavio Samuel's, Revolt's CEO, says, \"One-hundred percent of Sean Combs's shares have been redeemed and retired,\" Mr. Samuels said in the interview. \"He is no longer chairman. He is no longer on the board. He has no shares, no equity in Revolt. We have completely separated and dissociated from each other.\"\n\nSome of the other entities that have cut ties with Combs or hs products include Hulu, Capital Preparatory Schools and America's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses.\n\nRELATED TAGS\n\nDiddy Revolt", "source": {"uri": "hiphopwired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Latest Hip-Hop News, Music and Media | Hip-Hop Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alvin_aqua_blanco@hiphopwired.com", "name": "Alvin Aqua Blanco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolt (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Best_Contacts_&_Eyeglasses", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "America's Best Contacts & Eyeglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(radio_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital (radio network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/06/17175219814193.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624366", "eventUri": "eng-9624366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1049, "textEnd": 1055}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 297, "textEnd": 308}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

In normal times, he'd likely have congratulated her publicly on his social media accounts, followed by a lavish party and the inevitable big-money gifts that celebrities usually give their children on such occasions.\n\nBut Diddy was noticeably absent from the graduation, his social media accounts gone silent since he apologized for his violent 2016 altercation with ex Cassie Ventura, who he dragged, kicked and threw a lamp at while they were staying in a Los Angeles hotel. In 2023, he settled with her the day after she filed a lawsuit alleging a pattern of sexual, emotional and physical abuse throughout their almost decade-long relationship.\n\nThe incident was detailed in the lawsuit. This week more revelations were made in a sweeping Rolling Stone story, and federal government authorities are reportedly ready to impanel a grand jury to talk to Combs' various accusers.\n\nHere is what transpired this week:\n\nFeds Impaneling Grand Jury?\n\nCNN acquired the hotel surveillance video that shows Diddy assaulting Cassie, and they are reporting that federal authorities are poised to impanel a grand jury to investigate the allegations. Combs is the subject of seven civil lawsuits, which include allegations of sexual assault. CNN reports that the accusers have been notified that they may be asked to provide testimony before a grand jury to see if there is enough evidence to indict but have not yet been prepped to do so. The Department of Homeland Security would not say on the record if they have a grand jury in the works but did tell the outlet that the investigation is \"ongoing.\"\n\nAbuse Allegations Date Back To College\n\nCombs did not graduate from Howard University but did matriculate there in 1987, leaving to pursue his music industry dreams. A six-month investigation by Rolling Stone magazine was full of explosive allegations about Diddy's temper and mistreatment of various Bad Boy staffers. The article details abuse going back to his days at one of the most venerated HBCUs in the country. Former Howard students detail witnessing Combs beating a girlfriend with a belt in front of horrified dorm residents. \"She was trying to defend herself a little bit,\" the witness told RS. \"She was crying. And we were telling him, 'Get off of her.' We were screaming for her.\" The two reporters say they reached out to 300 former Bad Boy artists staffers and industry insiders, ultimately talking to 50, most of whom wanted to remain anonymous.\n\nVoletta Wallace Weighs In\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.'s mother, Voletta Wallace, told Rolling Stone in a separate interview that the abuse allegations and revelations that her son wanted to leave the Bad Boy label in the last months of his life have upset her.\n\n\"I'm praying for Cassie. I'm praying for his mother. I don't want to believe the things that I've heard, but I've seen [the hotel video],\" she said. \"I pray that he apologizes to her.\"\n\nFormer Bad Boy executive Kirk Burrowes says that Diddy, then known as Puff Daddy was jealous of Biggie and Tupac Shakur's friendship which soured in 1994 when Shakur was shot at a New York City recording studio. Shakur said then that Combs and Wallace had him set up, something that was dismissed at the time. Former gang member Duane \"Keefe D\" has been arrested for Shakur's murder after providing details about it on various interview shows. He says that Combs offered him $1M to kill Shakur.\n\nWallace, now 71, doesn't appear to believe Combs had anything to do with her son's death, saying that she liked him.\n\n\"I hope that I see Sean one day and the only thing I want to do is slap the daylights out of him. And you can quote me on that.\" She added, \"Because I liked him. I didn't want to believe all the awful things, but I'm so ashamed and embarrassed.\" And she's not the only mother of someone connected to Combs who weighed in on his bad behavior. Portia Stewart, the mother of music industry executive Shakir Stewart, said Combs hit her son over the head with a chair in Italy because of his relationship with Kim Porter, the mother of three of Diddy's children. Stewart needed stitches. He died by suicide in 2009.\n\nRolling Stone says that Combs was provided with a detailed list of the allegations. In response, his lawyer, Johnathan Davis, told the outlet, \"Mr. Combs cannot comment on settled litigation, will not comment on pending litigation, and cannot address every allegation picked up by the press from any source, no matter how unreliable.\"\n\nHe added, \"We are aware that the proper authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and therefore have confidence any important issues will be addressed in the proper forum, where the rules distinguish facts from fiction.\"\n\nRELATED TAGS\n\ncassie Diddy Domestic Violence Domestic violence allegations lawsuit Sexual assault

Combs later issued a video admission of his abuse of Ventura, who filed a $30 million lawsuit against Combs last year. Combs, however, has previously denied abuse agsint Ventura. Combs settled the suit in one day, but a slew of other lawsuits by other people-women and men-accusing the business man of abuse.\n\nCarnell's tweet highlights a growing sentiment within the music industry and among the public about Combs and his seeming pattern of abuse. Many are re-examining the legacy of the man known by various monikers including Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Love. \"Everyone in the music industry knows about Diddy's insidious past,\" one source told Page Six.\n\nFollowing the settlement, the hashtag #SurvivingDiddy trended on social media. Former associates, like singer Aubrey O'Day of Danity Kane, have hinted at the dark side of Combs' persona, claiming they've tried to expose his behavior for years.\n\nCarnell's condemnation of Combs is a broader call to re-evaluate how success and influence are defined and rewarded in the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nThe man has always been a monster. And too many #ADOS want to be celebrities so they can be monsters too. Somewhere along the way, people started mistaking being a Boss with being a terror. No space for community in that. It's time to re-evaluate our values.", "source": {"uri": "moguldom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moguldom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_brown@moguldom.com", "name": "Ann Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Descendants_of_Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Descendants of Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(Kanye_West_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monster (Kanye West song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reparations for slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danity_Kane", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danity Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://moguldom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-04-at-9.10.19-AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624366", "eventUri": "eng-9624366", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Its Own Employees", "body": "Revolt CEO Detavio Samuels, speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, revealed that the answer is not another high-flying media or music mogul, nor is it a larger company looking to fold Revolt into its portfolio.\n\nRevolt's new ownership group is being led by its own employees.\n\n\"I think there's been a lot of speculation around who owned Revolt, who was going to own Revolt. And while we've been well aware of the rumors over the last several months, I would say that it was important for us to stay the course on this specific approach,\" Samuels says. \"What makes me excited about the news to share today is just the realization that we didn't need anybody else, that we were the ones that we have been looking for the whole time.\"\n\nSamuels says that Revolt's employees will hold the largest pool of equity in the company, with other shareholders holding smaller pools of capital. There is no single majority owner, with a board of directors overseeing the company, but Samuels says that the other shareholders are \"all people who have been along for the ride for a long time.\" Page Six reported that Shea Moisture founder Richelieu Dennis was the buyer of Diddy's shares, though he is not involved in the move to the employee ownership structure.\n\nRevolt launched just over a decade ago as a cable TV play. Founded by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the media company initially was focused on carving out a piece of the pay-TV business with a music-focused channel for young consumers.\n\nWhile Revolt has pivoted a few times since then, and changed its leadership, it remained very much a product of Diddy. That is until serious allegations of sexual assault were raised about the mogul, and leaks about a federal trafficking investigation emerged. Diddy stepped aside as executive chairman of Revolt late last year, and subsequently disposed of his large stake in the company.\n\nSpeaking to THR in March, Samuels said that the company did not lose any business due to the association with Diddy.\n\n\"I'm grateful for this team that stood in the midst of the fire and didn't crumble, and I'm grateful for those advertisers and brands who stood by us,\" he said at the time. \"I think they recognize that if Revolt leaves the Black-owned media ecosystem, that is quite a loss. So whether they spoke to us or they didn't, behind the scenes, they kept us protected and kept investing in Revolt. The purpose of the company isn't shifting, regardless of who owns it or who doesn't own it.\"\n\nThat focus has, in recent years, been on creators, with less emphasis on the declining business of cable TV (though Revolt still has a linear channel).\n\n\"We exist to shift the narrative for Black people globally. Our mission, how we do that, is by building the world's largest, most powerful Black storytelling engine on the planet, we've always said we were going to be powered by creators,\" Samuels says. \"And so while you won't see a change, what you'll see us really leaning into right now is this creator idea, positioning ourselves as Revolt, the home for creators that shape culture. We have a right to win there. We've been doing that for the last four years, we will continue doing that, but now only in a bigger and better way.\"\n\nSamuels says that the company will further build out its creator business, including turning its Atlanta studio into a creator studio \"for those people who we know are more likely to be left out of the equation.\"\n\n\"We see a phenomenal opportunity to build the best creator playground for Black creatives. Nobody else has what we have,\" Samuels adds. \"Nobody can take a creator and put them on cable TV, FAST channel, CTV, mobile, YouTube, audio, podcast, live events.\"\n\nAnd the executive, who represents the workforce on Revolt's board, frames the new ownership structure as one that he wants to be replicated across the economy.\n\n\"Gone are the days where employees just go work for yet another rich family or yet another multi-millionaire or billionaire. I'm hoping that we set a new standard, which is the people who give their blood, sweat and tears to these companies every day deserve to participate in the success of the company from a strategy standpoint,\" Samuels says. \"I'm hoping that we get to that billion dollar valuation, and when we do that, our employees will have generated generational wealth could have never imagined. So that's the long term play for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weprin@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Alex Weprin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolt (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_ad-supported_streaming_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free ad-supported streaming television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CTV Television Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Image-H-2024.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624366", "eventUri": "eng-9624366", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

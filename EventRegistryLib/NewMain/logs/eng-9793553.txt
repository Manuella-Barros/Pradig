Bar a huge surprise, Eluned Morgan will be named the sixth person to hold the role, and the first woman.\n\nMs Morgan was elected Welsh Labour leader on July 24 after Vaughan Gething triggered the second leadership contest of the year for the party after standing down. To become First Minister, a vote of all Senedd members has to take place and they are being recalled from their summer break for that to happen.\n\nWe expect the Conservatives will put forward their leader, Andrew RT Davies, and Plaid Cymru their leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, however, Labour holds more seats than both those parties so parliamentary maths means Mrs Morgan is likely to win. The vote is being held at 11am.\n\nREAD MORE: Eluned Morgan has 'crisis after crisis to fix' and the scale of the job can't be underestimated\n\nMrs Morgan, who has been the health minister in the Welsh Government since 2021, was named Welsh Labour leader on July 24.

Previous recalls have been to discuss pressing matters like the Covid pandemic, Brexit and the future of the steel industry.\n\nThe last time it was recalled was in September 2022 to pay tribute following the death of HM Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThis time, it is meeting in what is known as hybrid form, meaning that some members will be in the chamber in Cardiff Bay while others will attend and vote virtually.\n\nArrangements have also been made to allow MSs who are overseas to play their part. Previously that wasn't allowed.\n\nVoting is done via a 'roll call' in which Senedd members are called in alphabetical order to say who they want to be first minister.\n\nLabour members are expected to nominate Eluned Morgan while the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru will nominate their own leaders.\n\nLabour is the largest party in the Senedd but doesn't have a majority so if all three opposition parties join forces they could block Eluned Morgan's nomination.\n\nHowever, Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds is expected to abstain, meaning Ms Morgan is almost certain to be chosen.\n\nOnce that decision has been taken, the Llywydd or Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, will contact the King to inform him of the Senedd's choice.\n\nAt some point during the afternoon, the King will confirm he has appointed Eluned Morgan to be first minister after which she will swear her oath of office in front of a judge.\n\nHer first task will be to appoint a cabinet. Given how deeply divided the Labour group has been in the last few months, that won't be an easy job.\n\nShould she appoint her predecessor Vaughan Gething or does she need to put further distance between her time in charge and the divisive period of his time?\n\nWho will take over from Eluned Morgan in health? There's speculation that the former economy secretary, Jeremy Miles, will be given the job.\n\nHe stood in the leadership election which Vaughan Gething won but decided not to stand this time in the interests of party unity.\n\nFor many Gething supporters, Mr Miles is seen as being part of the problems which engulfed their party this year, which could lead to problems further down the line.\n\nThe all-important budget\n\nI'm told that the Labour group is determined to put aside its differences and heal its wounds, but those wounds are deep and healing them won't be easy.\n\nNot only that but the new first minister will need to reach out to other parties because Labour's lack of majority means it will need the support or abstention of at least one of the opposition groups (including the single Lib Dem MS) to pass legislation and, more crucially, its budget.\n\nThat had become an impossibility under Vaughan Gething because all opposition members had voted against him in a confidence vote, making it unlikely that any deal could change their mind.\n\nEluned Morgan will have to start talks straight away if they haven't already begun with the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems, to see what would persuade them to allow her budget to pass at the end of the year.\n\nIf she can't do that, then we really are in uncharted waters. If a first minister can't govern, it could lead to an early Senedd election when the next one isn't due to be held until 2026.\n\nThat's certainly what Plaid Cymru is calling for, pointing out that Labour politicians regularly called for a UK election when the Conservatives had three prime ministers in one year without an election.\n\nNow that there have been three first ministers in one year, Plaid Cymru argues that voters here in Wales should be given a say. It's a view that has been shared by some within Welsh Labour, too, though I detect that the appetite for that may have gone away.\n\nEarly or not, an election is very much on Labour's minds.\n\nMany within the party here in Wales think they are on course for a hammering in 2026, something borne out by recent research from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, a hammering likely to be made worse by a new, proportional voting system which Labour itself (with the support of Plaid Cymru) is introducing.\n\nNew FM has most difficult task in 25 years\n\nSo, in a short space of time, Eluned Morgan has to unite the divided Labour group in the Senedd, reach deals with opposition parties that will enable her to get a budget and future legislation as well as persuading voters to give her party another chance in 2026 at a time when funding is shrinking and the ability to blame Conservative UK governments has disappeared.\n\nAll of that means that she's about to have the most difficult task of any FM in 25 years, but one thing that might help her is her own experience in politics.\n\nIt may sound strange to describe anyone who's a Baroness and has been in elected Labour politics for 30 years as an underdog, but in some ways she has been just that.\n\nShe has been seen as too 'Blairite' for many on the left in Welsh Labour and too left-wing for many in the centre. She nearly didn't make it to the ballot in 2018's leadership election, only Carwyn Jones 'lending' his nomination to ensure a woman was in the contest enabled her to stand.\n\nNow with the odds so heavily stacked against her, as well as being the first female first minister, she could also be the first underdog first minister.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV

ministers.\n\nBaroness Morgan, 57, was confirmed as leader of the Welsh Labour Party on July 24, but could not take over as First Minister without a vote in the Senedd.\n\nThe Welsh Parliament, which would normally be on summer break, was recalled on Tuesday to allow Baroness Morgan, the health minister, to take over as leader of the Welsh government.\n\nShe becomes the first woman to lead the country.\n\nShe had the support of the Labour members of the Senedd while Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives voted for their respective party leaders.\n\nJane Dodds, the sole Liberal Democrat, abstained from endorsing a candidate, despite having supported Mr Gething earlier this year.\n\nThe opposition parties putting forward alternative choices was largely symbolic, with neither having enough votes to secure the role.\n\nIn total, Baroness Morgan received 28 votes, one more than her predecessor Mr Gething.\n\nThe Conservatives' Andrew RT Davies won 15 votes and Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth 12 votes.\n\nHer backers include the outgoing FM Mr Gething.\n\nBaroness Morgan is the first woman to lead the Welsh government in its 25-year history, something she has said she is extremely proud of.\n\nShe is also the third leader of Welsh Labour this year, after a difficult few months since Mr Gething took over from Mark Drakeford in March.\n\nMr Gething announced his intention to resign last month after four members of his government quit, criticising his leadership.\n\nDuring the last leadership race, Mr Gething took a \u00a3200,000 donation for his campaign from a company owned by a man twice convicted of environmental offences, which led to some members of his own party criticising his judgment.\n\nIn June, Mr Gething lost a vote of no confidence in the Senedd, after rows over the donation, and his decision to sack Delyn MS Hannah Blythyn as a minister.\n\nBaroness Morgan ran on a \"unity ticket\", promising to bring the Labour group back together.", "source":

She is expected to be named the sixth person to hold the role, and the first woman.\n\nMs Morgan was elected Welsh Labour leader on July 24 after Vaughan Gething triggered the second leadership contest of the year for the party after standing down.\n\nTo become First Minister, a vote of all Senedd members has to take place and they are being recalled from their summer break for that to happen, reports WalesOnline. The vote is scheduled to take place at 11am.\n\nREAD MORE: Police probe major parking scam targeting drivers in two North Wales resorts\n\nREAD MORE: Exact locations of all 110 mobile speed camera sites in North Wales in August 2024\n\nIt comes after Vaughan Gething formally resigned as First Minister. Yesterday he wrote on X: \"I have today written to His Majesty The King to tender my resignation as Prif Weinidog. It has been an honour to serve the people of Wales. The decency, generosity and creative spirit that defines our nation is, and will continue to be, our greatest strength.\"\n\nIt expected the Conservatives will put forward their leader, Andrew RT Davies, and Plaid Cymru their leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth. But Labour holds more seats than both those parties so parliamentary maths means Mrs Morgan is likely to win. The vote is being held at 11am.\n\nMrs Morgan, who has been the health minister in the Welsh Government since 2021, was named Welsh Labour leader on July 24. She was the only person who put her name forward for election after Mr Gething announced he would stand down as leader after four of his senior cabinet colleagues quit en masse.\n\nWelsh Labour had announced a summer-long leadership contest to replace him, and Mr Gething had expected to be in place until the autumn, but because Mrs Morgan was elected as Welsh Labour leader unopposed, the process has been much quicker.\n\nThe vote in the Senedd is a roll call vote, meaning Senedd members say the name of the person they want to vote for. As the vote is being held during the summer break, Senedd members will be allowed to vote from overseas.\n\nSign up now for the latest news on the North Wales Live Whatsapp community\n\nSee the news happening in your area:", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_bagnall@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Steve Bagnall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ruth_mosalski@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Mosalski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Conservative_Party_leadership_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Conservative Party leadership election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluned_Morgan,_Baroness_Morgan_of_Ely", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eluned Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Ely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_RT_Davies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew RT Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhun_ap_Iorwerth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhun ap Iorwerth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Post_(North_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Post (North Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Vigoro", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Vigoro", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article28015332.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_rbp_mai100123eluned11272JPGjp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793553", "eventUri": "eng-9793553", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 192, "textEnd": 199, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Morgan has been confirmed as the first female first minister of Wales, following a vote in the Welsh Parliament.\n\nThe Senedd was recalled from its summer break to nominate her, after Vaughan Gething resigned.\n\nMembers of the Senedd (MSs) were able to take part in the vote virtually, including from abroad.\n\nMs Morgan said it was \"the greatest honour of my life to stand before you today as the first woman to become the first minister of Wales\".\n\nMs Morgan became leader of Welsh Labour last month and has been health minister since May 2021.\n\nShe was backed by 28 MSs, Conservative Andrew RT Davies received 15 votes and Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth 12.\n\nMs Morgan, who becomes the sixth Welsh first minister of Wales, thanked Mr Gething for his service, describing him as a \"true trailblazer\" on Wales' \"devolution journey\".\n\n\"As I take up the mantle of leadership I promise to honour [my predecessor's] achievements and add my own contributions to this legacy,\" she told the Senedd.\n\n\"Perhaps with a vibrant splash of colour - the grey suits are out.\"\n\nMr Gething quit last month after four members of his cabinet resigned.\n\nHis leadership was mired in controversy after he accepted donations from a man twice convicted of environmental offences during his election campaign.\n\nThe sacking of one of his cabinet ministers over leaked messages also caused a row within the party.\n\nMs Morgan told MSs that she looked forward to the day when a \"woman becoming first minister is no longer extraordinary but a normal part of our Welsh political life\".\n\nShe told women watching Tuesday's events in Cardiff Bay \"you need to know your potential is limitless\".\n\n\"The path to leadership is not now just a possibility, it's a reality,\" she said.\n\nAfter a period of infighting within the Welsh Labour group, which she described as \"difficult\" Ms Morgan said \"we must work to restore trust\".\n\n\"Wales is warm and welcoming nation and our political discourse needs to reflect that.\"\n\n\"Our differences should be a source of strength, not a source of division,\" she said.\n\n\"We have been through some turmoil, but we know we are best when we work in unity, as a party and nation.\"\n\nPledging to focus on achievement and delivery, she also warned of \"tough decisions\" because of what she called the \"dire\" state of UK public finances.\n\nOffering Ms Morgan his \"heartfelt congratulations and support\", Sir Keir Starmer said Ms Morgan had \"today made history as the first ever woman to become first minister of Wales\".\n\n\"Eluned has a long history of public service and her commitment to delivering for the people of Wales is unwavering,\" he said.\n\nIn a nod to the turmoil that has engulfed Welsh Labour in recent months, the path of events that had led to her appointment, the prime minister added: \"I know she will lead a unified and ambitious Welsh government.\n\n\"Labour in Wales and Westminster will work side by side firmly in the service of working people.\"\n\nHow did opposition parties respond?\n\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies congratulated Ms Morgan on winning the top job, but warned that \"for the last few months, the Welsh Labour government has been so busy with infighting it has further neglected our public services\".\n\n\"Wales needs someone in the top job now who can drive down our waiting lists, improve educational attainment and turbocharge our economy,\" he said.\n\n\"Sadly, on the basis of her record, there is little reason to believe Eluned Morgan will be that person.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth called for a Senedd election, 21 months before one is due to take place to end the \"revolving door of first minsters\".\n\nWales has now had three first ministers since March, when Mr Gething replaced his predecessor Mark Drakeford.\n\nWith 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay, Labour needs opposition help to govern, and Plaid pulled its support from a cooperation agreement with Welsh ministers during Vaughan Gething's administration.\n\nMr ap Iorwerth said he had \"no intention to do a budget deal with Welsh Labour\".\n\n\"We will look at things in a mature way, but whilst always telling the people of Wales now at this crucial juncture, less than two years from the next Senedd election, there is a different way of doing politics,\" he said.\n\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, and the party's only MS, said she was \"delighted to see another woman leading the way in Welsh politics\".\n\nShe said that \"with the new government in Westminster and a new first minister, we have a real opportunity here in Wales to demonstrate a fresh Welsh, ambitious approach and a different kind of politics\".", "source":

the position and is likely to be appointed to the role.\n\nMr Gething announced his resignation less than four months into his tenure.\n\nHis departure came following the coordinated resignation of three ministers, including Wrexham's Lesley Griffiths, and the Welsh Government's chief legal adviser.\n\nControversies such as a \u00a3200,000 donation from a convicted polluter, a lost no-confidence vote, and the dismissal of a minister accused of leaking sensitive information mired Mr Gething's time in office.\n\nRecall\n\nThe Senedd has been recalled for a special session today (Tuesday, 6 August) at 11.00 am to nominate a new First Minister.\n\nMr Gething will formally tender his resignation to the King, with the Llywydd (Presiding Officer) notifying the Senedd once the resignation is officially accepted by the Palace.\n\nA dedicated Plenary session will commence, expected to last around 30 minutes, during which the Llywydd will invite Members to nominate candidates for the First Minister position.\n\nFollowing her recent election as leader of Welsh Labour, Eluned Morgan MS is anticipated to be nominated by her party group and to become the next First Minister.\n\nEluned Morgan, also known as Baroness Morgan of Ely, has been a Member of the House of Lords since 2011.\n\nHer position in the Lords does not preclude her from becoming First Minister, as she has been on a

Minister.\n\nProcess\n\nShould no other nominations arise, Eluned Morgan will be declared the nominee.\n\nIn the case of multiple nominations, a roll call vote will be conducted, with additional votes required in the event of a tie.\n\nFor more than two candidates, a series of votes will continue until a single candidate secures a majority, with the lowest vote-getter eliminated in each round.\n\nThe successful candidate will deliver a short address before the Llywydd concludes the session.\n\nThe Llywydd will then recommend the nominee to the King for formal appointment.\n\nUpon confirmation, the new First Minister will begin forming their Cabinet, with announcements expected in the following weeks.\n\nA temporary Counsel General may be appointed immediately, but the Senedd must later approve a motion for a permanent appointment.\n\nThis debate is expected to occur after the Senedd's summer recess.\n\nAdditionally, changes to Senedd postholders, including new Committee

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe woman set to be named Wales' First Minister has a long list of issues to tackle when, barring a dramatic turn of events, she unpacks her boxes in the First Minister's office this afternoon. Eluned Morgan is widely expected to be named First Minister after a vote in the Senedd today (August 6) which takes place from 11am.\n\nAs long as she succeeds, she will replace Vaughan Gething in the role. He quit last month after months of pressure came to a head when four of his senior cabinet colleagues quit en masse. She has already replaced him as Welsh Labour leader after standing unopposed.\n\nFormer MP and current member of the House of Lords, Mrs Morgan will be the sixth First Minister of Wales, the third person to have held the role in 2024, and the first woman to have ever held it in the 25 years of devolution. You can read all about her here.\n\nREAD MORE: Man who fled to Wales after being shot taken to court by Caribbean water supplier\n\nREAD MORE: The huge challenge facing Welsh Labour as major change forecast at Senedd election\n\n1. Keeping colleagues happy\n\nVaughan Gething will be able to tell Eluned Morgan the perils of your colleagues not having your back, so it will be imperative she has their backing, and keeps it. When she announced she planned to stand as First Minister for a second time (she was defeated by Mark Drakeford and Vaughan Gething in 2018) it was greeted by a flood of supportive messages from her Labour colleagues. That universal support hasn't always been the case, but her decision to stand on a unity ticket, seems to have brought the 29 other Labour Senedd members on side.\n\nPolitics, however, is a fickle business, and as she herself has admitted, she will need to keep them on side not just now, in these early days, but long term.\n\n2. Appointing a cabinet\n\nThe final straw for Vaughan Gething was when four of his cabinet colleagues: Jeremy Miles, Lesley Griffiths, Julie James and Mick Antoniw, quit en masse within minutes of each other. Soon after Vaughan Gething started the process of standing down as First Minister as it was no longer possible for him to remain in post without his cabinet. He then did a quick rejig, expanding the briefs of some of the more senior politicians, and adding two big promotions. Sarah Murphy, the Bridgend MS, had only been made a junior minister when Mr Gething sacked Hannah Blythyn a few weeks into her tenure, but she was promoted to minister level, and Jack Sargeant, the Alyn and Deeside MS, was given a junior role in cabinet for the first time.\n\nHowever, now Eluned Morgan has to work out exactly what to do with who. She's promised big changes, but there's a fairly limiting factor - there isn't a huge pool of people to pick from, and there are some egos to massage.\n\nThe biggest questions are who she will give her health role to, and what she will do with Vaughan Gething. Will she keep him in the cabinet, and does he even want to be there? One theory is Vaughan Gething might be given the Counsel General role, given his legal background. In terms of health, you need experience, but it is an all encompassing, draining role, and one not everyone is keen to take on given the pressure and likely chances of making any progress with long-standing issues.\n\nWe know Huw Irranca-Davies will be deputy First Minister, but don't know if he will keep his rural affairs role - something that was a worry to people we spoke to at the Royal Welsh a few weeks ago.\n\nAnd will those who were rapidly promoted be just as rapidly demoted? Watch this space.\n\n3. Health\n\nMore than anyone, she knows the huge list of things that need fixing in the health service. Most pressing are averting doctors' strikes and getting waiting lists down but neither is easily solved, something she knows first hand. She also knows without some headline grabbing improvements soon, it is something her party will be battered over at the ballot box.\n\nShe needs to pick someone to take the role on who can hit the ground running and make some quick progress, because there is a Senedd election in 2026 with some worrying predictions for Labour, and being able to go on the doorsteps and shout about some good health news would, you'd imagine, assuage an awful lot of the questions around Labour's influence.\n\nFun fact: Both Mark Drakeford and Vaughan Gething were health ministers before being first ministers too.\n\n4. Money, money, money\n\nThe Welsh Government gets money from the UK Government to pay for the services it delivers, more than \u00a318bn a year. When it was a Conservative administration in Downing Street, the most common attack line from Labour politicians in Cardiff Bay was that they weren't getting enough and it was their fault Labour couldn't deliver everything it wanted. Politically, they can't say that any more.\n\nPlus, listen to anything the new UK Labour government was saying before the election and it was clear, more money wasn't coming down the M4. That's been put into sharper focus since chancellor Rachel Reeves made a speech outlining exactly how little money there was.\n\nIt means Eluned Morgan has to make some big ticket adjustments without any budget.\n\n5. Making friends across the chamber\n\nOne of the many talking points that had made it clear Vaughan Gething was going to struggle to continue as First Minister was when Lib Dem Jane Dodds said she wouldn't support him to pass a budget. It led many of us to the rulebooks to check exactly what happens if that didn't happen, with a realistic possibility being that there could be an early Senedd election.\n\nIt's because Labour hold exactly half of the Senedd's 60 seats. So to get anything passed, they need the support of another MS from anywhere in the chamber. Sometimes, that's a given if it's something they back, but they are politicians and that means politics also comes into it.\n\nPlaid and the Lib Dems are more likely to lend Labour votes than the Conservatives but on the budget - the process of which will dominate the autumn term - they will want something in return. Sometimes that has been by getting backing for a specific project or pledge of an idea, or one thing talked about regularly is whether Ms Dodds would be offered a ministerial or deputy ministerial role, something Lib Dem Kirsty Williams had when she became education minister under Carwyn Jones.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors":

Wales is a warm and welcoming nation and our political discourse needs to reflect that.\"\n\nBaroness Morgan, who was elected Welsh Labour leader on July 24 after no contest, thanked Mr Gething who she described as trailblazer on the devolution journey.\n\nThe vote was the first time members have been recalled to confirm a new first minister, with the Senedd last recalled in 2022 to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFinishing a distant third in the race to replace Carwyn Jones as leader in 2018, Baroness Morgan could hardly have imagined then she would become first minister.\n\nShe declined to stand when Mark Drakeford stood down in December due to the \"bruising\" experience in 2018 but she now has been thrust into the top job.\n\n'Glass ceiling'\n\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservative opposition, congratulated Baroness Morgan but warned that the revolving door of first ministers has had a corrosive effect.\n\nHe told the Senedd: \"When I was speaking to my daughters this morning, they made the point that there will be a different dynamic having a woman in the centre of the chamber.\"\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth reiterated his party's calls for a snap Senedd election, criticising Labour \"chaos\" and warning that \"more of the same is no longer an option\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's leader urged Baroness Morgan to reset the relationship between the Welsh and UK Governments beyond mere sound bites.\n\nMs Dodds, the Lib Dems' leader in Wales, who abstained in the vote, called for unity, warning of the \"dark truth\" of a lack of confidence in politicians.\n\nClosing proceedings in the Siambr, Elin Jones pointed to the ceiling in the Senedd chamber, saying \"we finally broke through that glass ceiling\".\n\nWho is Eluned Morgan?\n\nBorn in Ely, Cardiff, one of the most deprived parts of the country, the politician's parents were both local councillors and her father was a Church in Wales vicar.\n\nEducated at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, then the only Welsh-medium school in the city, she later picked coffee in Nicaragua while supporting the Sandinista movement in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1994, she was the youngest member of the European Parliament when she was elected to represent Mid and West Wales aged 27.\n\nMade a peer in 2011, Baroness Morgan was elected to the Senedd in 2016, joining the cabinet a year later as minister for Welsh language and lifelong learning.\n\nIn 2022, she apologised unreservedly after receiving a six-month driving ban for repeated speeding, with the standards commissioner criticising her for setting a poor example.\n\nShe also faced criticism in 2023 after placing Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board back into special measures but she narrowly survived a Conservative motion of no confidence.\n\nWhat next?\n\nBaroness Morgan is expected to unveil her cabinet in the next few days, with Wales' new first minister set for her first FMQs after summer recess on September 17.\n\nWe know Ogmore MP Huw Irranca-Davies, the climate change minister, who ran on a joint ticket with Baroness Morgan, will become deputy first minister.\n\nHe will be the first person to hold the role since Ieuan Wyn Jones, the former Plaid Cymru leader, who held the post as part of the 'One Wales' government from 2007 to 2011.\n\nAs well as trying to unite a fractured Labour group, a key challenge facing Baroness Morgan will be passing the Welsh Government's draft budget which will be published in December.\n\nLabour holds exactly half of the Senedd's 60 seats, meaning the Welsh Government will need wider support to agree its spending plans for 2025/26.\n\nThen there's the small matter of a Senedd election on the horizon in 2026, with Labour leading Plaid Cymru by only 1% according to latest polls.", "source":

But I'm acutely aware that he and I are just links in a chain of leadership that stretches back to the very start of devolution: Alun, who helped lay the foundations of the Assembly; Rhodri, the visionary advocate; Carwyn, who steered us through austerity; Mark, who guided us during the pandemic; and Vaughan, who broke diversity barriers with his historic victory.\n\n\"As I take up the mantle of leadership, I promise to honour their achievements and add my own distinctive contribution to this legacy, perhaps with a vibrant splash of colour -- the grey suits are out. This is a historic day as a woman becomes the First Minister of Wales for the first time in our history.\"\n\nHis leadership was beset by controversy over donations from a convicted polluter and the sacking of a cabinet colleague accused of leaking to the press.\n\n'Turmoil'\n\nNominated by her predecessor, Baroness Morgan said: \"We must work to restore trust. Wales is a warm and welcoming nation and our political discourse needs to reflect that.\"\n\nBaroness Morgan, who was elected Welsh Labour leader on July 24 after no contest, thanked Mr Gething who she described as trailblazer on the devolution journey.\n\nThe vote was the first time members have been recalled to confirm a new first minister, with the Senedd last recalled in 2022 to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFinishing a distant third in the race to replace Carwyn Jones as leader in 2018, Baroness Morgan could hardly have imagined then she would become first minister.\n\nShe declined to stand when Mark Drakeford stood down in December due to the \"bruising\" experience in 2018 but she now has been thrust into the top job.\n\n'Glass ceiling'\n\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservative opposition, congratulated Baroness Morgan but warned that the revolving door of first ministers has had a corrosive effect.\n\nHe told the Senedd: \"When I was speaking to my daughters this morning, they made the point that there will be a different dynamic having a woman in the centre of the chamber.\"\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth reiterated his party's calls for a snap Senedd election, criticising Labour \"chaos\" and warning that \"more of the same is no longer an option\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's leader urged Baroness Morgan to reset the relationship between the Welsh and UK Governments beyond mere sound bites.\n\nMs Dodds, the Lib Dems' leader in Wales, who abstained in the vote, called for unity, warning of the \"dark truth\" of a lack of confidence in politicians.\n\nClosing proceedings in the Siambr, Elin Jones pointed to the ceiling in the Senedd chamber, saying \"we finally broke through that glass ceiling\".\n\nWho is Eluned Morgan?\n\nBorn in Ely, Cardiff, one of the most deprived parts of the country, the politician's parents were both local councillors and her father was a Church in Wales vicar.\n\nEducated at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, then the only Welsh-medium school in the city, she later picked coffee in Nicaragua while supporting the Sandinista movement in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1994, she was the youngest member of the European Parliament when she was elected to represent Mid and West Wales aged 27.\n\nMade a peer in 2011, Baroness Morgan was elected to the Senedd in 2016, joining the cabinet a year later as minister for Welsh language and lifelong learning.\n\nIn 2022, she apologised unreservedly after receiving a six-month driving ban for repeated speeding, with the standards commissioner criticising her for setting a poor example.\n\nShe also faced criticism in 2023 after placing Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board back into special measures but she narrowly survived a Conservative motion of no confidence.\n\nWhat next?\n\nBaroness Morgan is expected to unveil her cabinet in the next few days, with Wales' new first minister set for her first FMQs after summer recess on September 17.\n\nWe know Ogmore MP Huw Irranca-Davies, the climate change minister, who ran on a joint ticket with Baroness Morgan, will become deputy first minister.\n\nHe will be the first person to hold the role since Ieuan Wyn Jones, the former Plaid Cymru leader, who held the post as part of the 'One Wales' government from 2007 to 2011.\n\nAs well as trying to unite a fractured Labour group, a key challenge facing Baroness Morgan will be passing the Welsh Government's draft budget which will be published in December.\n\nLabour holds exactly half of the Senedd's 60 seats, meaning the Welsh Government will need wider support to agree its spending plans for 2025/26.\n\nThen there's the small matter of a Senedd election on the horizon in 2026, with Labour leading Plaid Cymru by only 1% according to latest polls.", "source":

Wales is a warm and welcoming nation and our political discourse needs to reflect that.\"\n\nBaroness Morgan, who was elected Welsh Labour leader on July 24 after no contest, thanked Mr Gething who she described as trailblazer on the devolution journey.\n\nThe vote was the first time members have been recalled to confirm a new First Minister, with the Senedd last recalled in 2022 to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFinishing a distant third in the race to replace Carwyn Jones as leader in 2018, Baroness Morgan could hardly have imagined then she would become First Minister.\n\nShe declined to stand when Mark Drakeford stood down in December due to the \"bruising\" experience in 2018 but she now has been thrust into the top job.\n\nAndrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservative opposition, congratulated Baroness Morgan but warned that the revolving door of First Ministers has had a corrosive effect.\n\nHe told the Senedd: \"When I was speaking to my daughters this morning, they made the point that there will be a different dynamic having a woman in the centre of the chamber.\"\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth reiterated his party's calls for a snap Senedd election, criticising Labour \"chaos\" and warning that \"more of the same is no longer an option\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's leader urged Baroness Morgan to reset the relationship between the Welsh and UK Governments beyond mere sound bites.\n\nMs Dodds, the Lib Dems' leader in Wales, who abstained in the vote, called for unity, warning of the \"dark truth\" of a lack of confidence in politicians.\n\nClosing proceedings in the Siambr, Elin Jones pointed to the ceiling in the Senedd chamber, saying \"we finally broke through that glass ceiling\".\n\nBorn in Ely, Cardiff, one of the most deprived parts of the country, the politician's parents were both local councillors and her father was a Church in Wales vicar.\n\nEducated at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf, then the only Welsh-medium school in the city, she later picked coffee in Nicaragua while supporting the Sandinista movement in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1994, she was the youngest member of the European Parliament when she was elected to represent Mid and West Wales aged 27.\n\nMade a peer in 2011, Baroness Morgan was elected to the Senedd in 2016, joining the cabinet a year later as minister for Welsh language and lifelong learning.\n\nIn 2022, she apologised unreservedly after receiving a six-month driving ban for repeated speeding, with the standards commissioner criticising her for setting a poor example.\n\nShe also faced criticism in 2023 after placing Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, in north Wales, back into special measures but she narrowly survived a Conservative motion of no confidence.\n\nBaroness Morgan is expected to unveil her cabinet in the next few days, with Wales' new First Minister set for her first FMQs after summer recess on September 17.\n\nWe know Ogmore MP Huw Irranca-Davies, the climate change minister, who ran on a joint ticket with Baroness Morgan, will become Deputy First Minister.\n\nHe will be the first person to hold the role since Ieuan Wyn Jones, the former Plaid Cymru leader, who held the post as part of the 'One Wales' government from 2007 to 2011.\n\nAs well as trying to unite a fractured Labour group, a key challenge facing Baroness Morgan will be passing the Welsh Government's draft budget which will be published in December.\n\nLabour holds exactly half of the Senedd's 60 seats, meaning the Welsh Government will need wider support to agree its spending plans for 2025/26.\n\nThen there's the small matter of a Senedd election on the horizon in 2026, with Labour leading Plaid Cymru by only 1% according to latest polls.", "source": {"uri": "caerphilly.observer", "dataType":

In his resignation statement, he added: \"This has been the most difficult time, for me, and my family. In 11 years as a minister, I have never ever made a decision for personal gain. I have never ever misused or abused my ministerial responsibilities. My integrity matters.

As I take up the mantle of leadership I promise to honour [Gething's] achievements and add my own contributions to this legacy - perhaps with a splash of colour: the grey suits are out.'\n\nShe added: 'For women watching today, you need to know your potential is limitless. The path to leadership is not now just a possibility, it's a reality.' Her election as leader marks the first time a part of Labour has been fronted by a woman.\n\nThough Morgan's path to the leadership has been relatively smooth, she is already facing trouble from other parties within the Senedd. Plaid Cymru is asking for an election after a 'revolving door of first ministers' in the country while Welsh Tory leader Davies said that, based on her record, there is not much reason to think she can deliver for the country, adding: 'More Labour failure is the last thing Wales needs.' As she rebuilds trust following a turbulent time in Welsh politics, Morgan could be in for a bumpy ride.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_tomes@spectator.us", "name": "Hannah Tomes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_and_West_Wales_(Senedd_electoral_region)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid and West Wales (Senedd electoral region)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_RT_Davies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew RT Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluned_Morgan,_Baroness_Morgan_of_Ely", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eluned Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Ely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Irranca-Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huw Irranca-Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhun_ap_Iorwerth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhun ap Iorwerth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Vigoro", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Vigoro", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2XKT81W.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793553", "eventUri": "eng-9793553", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Twenty-five years ago, we witnessed the dawn of a new era with the birth of devolution. This pivotal moment was the realisation of Welsh ambition, a rekindling of our national spirit and the beginning of a journey towards greater self-determination within the United Kingdom.\n\nI'd like to thank my direct predecessor in this role, Vaughan Gething, for his service -- another innovator on the journey of devolution.\n\nI want to thank my immediate predecessor to this role, Vaughan Gething, for his service, another true trailblazer on that devolution journey. But I'm acutely aware that he and I are just links in a chain of leadership that stretches back to the very start of devolution: Alun, who helped lay the foundations of the Assembly; Rhodri, the visionary advocate; Carwyn, who steered us through austerity; Mark, who guided us during the pandemic; and Vaughan, who broke diversity barriers with his historic victory.\n\nAs I take up the mantle of leadership, I promise to honour their achievements and add my own distinctive contribution to this legacy, perhaps with a vibrant splash of colour -- the grey suits are out. This is a historic day as a woman becomes the First Minister of Wales for the first time in our history.\n\nThis isn't just about shattering glass ceilings -- it's about shattering them for ever, using the pieces to create a mosaic of new possibilities. I carry with me the wisdom of the women who have battled, struggled, and persevered without the recognition that they've deserved.\n\nTo the young women watching today, you need to know your potential is limitless, the path to leadership is not now just a possibility, it's a reality, and I look forward to the day when a woman becoming First Minister is no longer extraordinary, but a normal part of our Welsh political life. As First Minister, I promise to champion voices and experiences that have too often been sidelined and silenced, to champion parts of Wales that too often feel like they're on the periphery, like my home in St Davids in west Wales. No-one will be left out. I extend my hand in gratitude and in genuine partnership to everyone in Wales. In a world where things that divide us are amplified and emphasised, sometimes for profit, I want to make it clear that I will be a listening First Minister, listening to all, not just those who shout the loudest or who have the most power.\n\nI hope to be defined by my tireless commitment to the people of Wales, by my years of public service, and my commitment to creating a fairer, greener and more prosperous nation for all of us, a leader who focuses on achievement and delivery, and who's ambitious for our nation, a leader who is driven by a sense of service and respect to the people I serve.\n\nI hope to be defined by my unwavering commitment to the people of Wales, by my years of public service and my determination to create a fairer, greener and more prosperous nation for us all, a leader focused on delivery and on ambition for our nation, a leader driven by a sense of service and respect for the people I serve. For 30 years I've dedicated my life to public service, guided by the values of fairness and justice. This journey has taken me from the European Parliament, to the chambers of Westminster, to the Senedd, representing Mid and West Wales, and now to the heart of the Welsh Government.\n\nI grew up in Ely, one of the largest council housing estates in Europe. As many of you know, our home, the vicarage, had an open-door policy. People would come along with their needs and troubles at all hours, day and night. It struck me then, as it does now, that so many intelligent and decent people weren't getting the breaks that they deserved. It also struck me how the incredible people, many of them women, some who are in the gallery today, who held that community together, created a deep sense of belonging and strength. This is the community that shaped me, the community that ignited my passion for democratic politics, and that made me a socialist and the trade unionist that I am today.\n\nAs I lived in that community, I learned an invaluable lesson about the need to listen -- to truly listen to the concerns and hopes of everyone.\n\nLiving in that community taught me the invaluable lesson of listening -- really listen to the concerns and hopes of everyone.\n\nRecent experiences on the doorsteps across Wales have revealed a troubling truth, I think, to us all, that many people have become deeply disconnected from the political process. Others are falling for superficially attractive answers to the most complex of issues -- answers that scapegoat the most vulnerable and breed mistrust and division. But, make no mistake, the greatest threat to our democracy isn't a particular party or ideology, it's the belief that politics cannot change society for the better. And I reject that belief entirely. As the threat of discord grows, we cannot be passive observers. We must all be active advocates for the fact that politics can change things for the better, and we must all be advocates that promote the proposition that all people are entitled to live with dignity and need to be afforded respect. We must work to restore trust with the public.\n\nWales is a warm and welcoming nation, and our political discourse needs to reflect that. Our differences should be a source of strength, not division. Our differences must be a source of strength, not a cause of division.\n\nThe last few weeks have been difficult and we've been through some turmoil, but we know that we are at our best when we work in unity, as a party and as a nation. Under my leadership, our focus will be firmly on Wales and its people, listening to what people want and delivering in every corner of this great nation.\n\nNow is the time to focus on the issues that genuinely impact our communities and are important to them.\n\nOver the summer, I'll be in all parts of Wales, listening to you, the public, to ensure that we tackle the concerns that really matter to you.\n\nMy vision is to see Wales as a nation where everyone can contribute to our success, regardless of their background.\n\nMy vision for Wales is one where everyone can contribute to our shared success, regardless of background. It's our job in Government to provide everyone with the opportunity to fulfil their potential. And this is based on a deep belief I have that the success of one leads to the success of many.\n\nBut we have to be realistic about the challenge ahead. The last 14 years have left the public finances in a dire state, and there will be some tough decisions to make. But the difference now will be that we will be making that work in partnership with the new UK Labour Government and its genuine commitment to public services, renewed respect for devolution and a desire to work together.\n\nNow, they used to say that behind every successful man there is a woman. On this occasion, there will be an impressive man behind a woman. Now, on this occasion, I'm not talking about my lovely husband Rhys. I'm thrilled to be embarking on this journey with Huw Irranca-Davies, and this marks the first step of many changes to come. I couldn't ask for a more capable political partner.\n\nWe bring a whole host of experience and understanding to our leadership, as well as a deep belief in the fact that people succeed when they work together for Wales.\n\nLlywydd, as we look to the future, I want everyone to know that their voices are important.\n\nI'll not be some distant figure in Cardiff Bay. I'm a Welsh citizen, just like you. I want to understand the challenges that you face. I want your priorities to become my priorities. Together, we can build a Wales that is open for business and committed to wealth creation, because if you want to share wealth, first of all you have to create it. We will fight poverty through economic growth and by redistributing our riches fairly. We will build a Wales that understands that well-being is at the heart of people's happiness and their ability to contribute; a Wales where our children can grow up with opportunities, where they can feel hopeful for the future; a Wales that leaves no stone unturned in our efforts to improve our NHS and education system, where we harness the latest technology to make public services better, and where we understand that, for the sake of future generations, we'll need to make changes to respond to the climate and nature emergencies.\n\nIn speaking up for Wales at every opportunity I intend to lead a government that listens, that learns and delivers. Today I invite you to join me in creating and forging a dynamic, diverse, nation where everyone can prosper and see themselves as people of possibility and potential.\n\nAt every opportunity I intend to lead a government that listens, learns and delivers.\n\nDiolch yn fawr.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

{"id": 231268062, "title": "Messenger's new community chats don't need to be connected to Facebook groups", "text": "Meta will now let you create massive community chats on Messenger with people you aren't connected to in any way. Back in 2022, the company launched community chats for Facebook Groups, giving people belonging to the same groups an easy way to talk in real time. While that community feature is tied to groups on the social network, this one isn't \u2014 it will let use Messenger like Discord to connect with as many as 5,000 random people using the app. The company didn't post an announcement, but it confirmed the new feature's rollout to TechCrunch. All community chats will be displayed in one place inside the Messenger app, with each one having a \"Home\" space where administrators can post updates and announcements. According to Meta's Help page for the feature, it's \"not available to everyone or on all platforms at this time.\" You'll know if you're part of this rollout if you see the option to create a new community in the left menu of your Messenger app on mobile. If you do create a community, you'll get the power to remove someone from the chat, report or remove content and delete the chat altogether. All members can issue shareable invites, though, so communities have the potential to grow big beyond the initial participants' circle. The fact that this flavor of Facebook chats is meant for public conversations, however, also means that you'd have to be more careful of what you share. It's not just current members who'll be able to see what you've said, but also future members other people invite. As TechCrunch notes, you could use the new option to make chats for schools, organizations, neighborhoods and other groups with a large number of potential members. It could also be a more convenient and better option than WhatsApp's similar community chats feature, since the app needs to be connected to a phone number.", "summary": "<p>Meta will now let you create massive community chats on Messenger with people you aren&#39;t connected to in any way.

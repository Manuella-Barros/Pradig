India and South Africa have both played excellent cricket and really deserve their place in Barbados this weekend. It is going to be so hard to call \u2013 with two teams who have played clean and aggressive cricket throughout the tournament. India are going to be so hard to beat. They bat so deep and in Jasprit Bumrah, have a world-class death bowler who can break the hearts of the opponents. In contrast, I picked South Africa as a dark horse before the tournament began, and it is very special to see them finally reach their first final after so many semi-final upsets. Getting over the hump and winning a World Cup is so special and if they can do it, it will create memories that will last a lifetime for the players and the nation. I have won the T20 World Cup on two occasions, and they are among the most special experiences I have in life \u2013 let alone cricket. I have so many treasured items from my career but my two rings for winning World Cups are the standouts. They are like Super Bowl rings, almost physical proof that you have climbed to the top of the mountain and become champions of the world. When she\u2019s older, I will give both of my rings \u2013 for being part of the West Indies sides that won the T20 World Cups in 2012 and 2016 \u2013 to my daughter and I can\u2019t wait for that moment. I will tell her to keep one, and then pass the other one down to my future grandchildren, and I\u2019m so proud to keep them in our family for generations. Barbados is going to be at its regal best for the final and the build-up to the match has brought back so many memories of our special day in 2012. But before I get to that, it\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s the journey to get to a final that truly forms a team and their identity. We played New Zealand in the final match of the Super 8s, and it went down to a Super Over \u2013 with the winner going through to the semi-final. I knew I had to be brave when I went out to bat, and I was lucky enough to thrive in situations where the pressure was most intense. I smacked the first ball for six, and in that moment I knew we\u2019d go on, win the match and the tournament. We played against Sri Lanka, the host nation, in the final and we really struggled. But Marlon Samuels played one of the innings of his life and we posted an okay total on a low-scoring pitch. Our bowlers then did the rest. When that final Sri Lankan wicket fell, and it was an indescribable moment. At first, I think I felt relief more than anything and then just pure joy. I didn\u2019t actually sleep that night, I think I was up for 24 hours after winning it. We went for a photoshoot the next morning and I don\u2019t think I want to see the pictures! We were so tired but so content with life at the same time. I had a good tournament in 2012 and finished as the fourth-highest run-scorer in six innings. Four years on, we were lucky enough to do it again and Carlos Brathwaite played that remarkable innings against England. Remember the name? In so many ways, it was more phenomenal to win it again \u2013 but I think experience counts for so much in finals. It\u2019s why India will be so confident on Sunday. Whoever comes out on top, they will join a select group of people who can call themselves a Men\u2019s T20 World Cup champion. I promise the winners, it\u2019s the most amazing feeling in the world.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/sports/chris-gayle-the-mens-t20-world-cup-final-is-one-to-savour/\" title=\"Chris Gayle: the Men&#8217;s T20 World Cup final is one to savour\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"709\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Chris-Gayle-28.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Chris-Gayle-28.jpg 709w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Chris-Gayle-28-150x100.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px\" /></a><p>ICC Exclusive Column<br />\nWe are at the end of what has been a brilliant ICC Men&#8217;s T20 World Cup 2024 &#x2013; and we have a final fit for the occasion.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/sports/chris-gayle-the-mens-t20-world-cup-final-is-one-to-savour/\">Chris Gayle: the Men&#8217;s T20 World Cup fina", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/sports/chris-gayle-the-mens-t20-world-cup-final-is-one-to-savour/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Chris-Gayle-28.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:01:04", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.142}

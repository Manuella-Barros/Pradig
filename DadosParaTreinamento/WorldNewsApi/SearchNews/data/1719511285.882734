It\u2019s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It\u2019s a nightmare. \u201cWe have so many questions that have no answers. But one. \u201cWas Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and - it seems - by many of you who are reading this. He was loved, and he will be missed. \u201cWe would like to thank the PGA Tour and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now. \u201cPlease respect our privacy as we work through this incredible tragedy, and please honour Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else. \u201cThank you.\u201d Murray (30) had spoken openly about his battles with alcoholism and depression. He played in this week\u2019s Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas but withdrew with two holes of his second round remaining, citing illness. He was found dead on Saturday, and the PGA Tour announced his death in a statement from Commissioner Jay Monahan. Murray won three times on the Korn Ferry Tour and twice on the PGA Tour, with his most recent win coming in January\u2019s Sony Open. Immediately after the win, an emotional Murray said: \u201cIt's not easy. I wanted to give up a lot of times. Give up on myself. Give up on the game of golf. Give up on life, at times.\" He also praised his fiancee, Christiana Ritchie, and Jesus. \"When you get tired of fighting, let someone else fight for you. ... I hope everyone at home watching can get a little inspiration from it. If I can just help one person, that's all it takes ... I knew today was not going to change my life, but it did change my career, and I'm excited.\" He qualified for the PGA Tour in 2017 and won the Barbasol Championship but was not shy in discussing his personal problems. In 2021, he revealed on Twitter that he was on probation from the PGA Tour for an incident in a hotel bar in Hawaii. He went on to write that he was an alcoholic and that playing the PGA Tour had been \u201cawful\u201d for him while claiming the tour had ignored his pleas for help. The PGA Tour released a statement in response, saying: \u201cWe can unequivocally say that the PGA Tour is a family, and when a member of that family needs help, we are there for him. That has been the case here and will continue to be.\u201d Monahan spoke to reporters at Colonial yesterday. \u201cI spent a lot of time with him because I wanted to understand what we could do, in his estimation, in his opinion, to help everybody else out here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m devastated by Grayson\u2019s loss \u2026 the conversations I had with him, particularly the last year, I learned an awful lot from him. He was very open and transparent with me.\u201d Peter Malnati, who played with Murray in Texas, broke down when speaking about the late star on Golf Channel on Saturday. \"This is gonna be really hard,\" he began. \"I didn\u2019t know Grayson all that well, but I spent the last few days with him. It\u2019s so funny... we get so worked up out here about a bad break here or a good break there. You know, we\u2019re so competitive, so competitive out here. We all want to beat each other. And then something like this happens and you realise we\u2019re all just humans. \"This is just a really, really hard day because you look at Grayson and you see in him someone who has visibly, outwardly struggled in the past, and he\u2019s been open about it. And you see him get his life back to a place where he\u2019s feeling good about things. It\u2019s just so sad.\u201d If you\u2019re affected by the issues in this article, you can find details of help here.", "summary": "<p>The parents of the late PGA Tour star Grayson Murray have spoken of the \u201cnightmare\u201d of his death by suicide yesterday at the age of 30.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/parents-of-grayson-murray-issue-statement-after-nightmare-of-his-tragic-death/a1514055212.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/t7Gb3vRkYjt_SbX9OqIb_2QnPhY=/0x27:3593x2422/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/8f6aa034-5ff1-43c4-a7b9-c2a636c07843/f9cdeb34-29ea-4780-83a8-0d2639bf120d/8f6aa034-5ff1-43c4-a7b9-c2a636c07843.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:28:41", "author": "Brian Keogh", "authors": ["Brian Keogh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.156}

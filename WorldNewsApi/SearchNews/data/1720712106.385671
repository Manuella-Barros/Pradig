{"id": 231931178, "title": "I tried \u00a35 Aldi Hawaiian Tropic suncream that's \u00a38 cheaper than Amazon and am returning for more", "text": "Buying quality suncream can get expensive, especially if you have a family to plaster with it. I recently bought a Lacura SPF 50+ Refreshing Dry Mist which cost \u00a33.99 for 200ml. Lacura is Aldi's own brand of skincare products. It sprayed on easily and wasn't at all greasy but my son's face got burnt and started to peel so I was very disappointed with it. I think perhaps you have to spray a lot to get the benefits. Either way, it made me realise I wanted to stick to well-known brands rather than supermarket own brand cream. So, next time I went to Aldi I was pleased to see that Hawaiian Tropic was on the Specialbuys aisle. You could choose from SPF30 and SP50 so I opted for the one with greater protection. The Hawaiian Tropic Luminosity SPF50 Sun Lotion generally costs between \u00a312.99 and \u00a314.99 for 180ml (currently on offer for \u00a312.45 at Amazon) whereas at Aldi, I could get it for just \u00a34.99. I thought it was worth a go. There's also the Hawaiian Tropic Island Glow Dry Spray Oil and the Body Butter in the Aldi deal.

It had a lovely coconut smell that reminded me of beach holidays. It's water resistant, is a vegan formulation, PETA certified cruelty-free and contains no oxybenzone or octinoxate. The lotion was silky and sank straight into the skin without leaving white marks and greasiness. As the name suggests, I felt it gave my skin a 'luminous' glow. It's blended with mango and shea butter extracts so it felt moisturising at the same time and it worked well under my make-up. More importantly, I put some on my son's face before we went out for a whole day in the sunshine. He didn't burn at all, without us even topping it up later in the day. Result. I plan to return for another bottle before it sells out. It is described as follows by Hawaiian Tropic: \"Luminosity Sun Lotion SPF 50 leaves skin protected, soft and with a radiant glow. Formulated not only to effectively protect, but to delight your senses and be enjoyable to use with Hawaiian Tropic's iconic island botanical scent and a luxurious feeling texture that leaves your skin with a beautiful looking glow.\" If you'd prefer to order online, Boots has a Hawaiian Tropic Hydrating Protection Sunscreen Lotion which costs \u00a37.90 for a 180ml bottle with an SPF 50 rating. There's a deal at Boots at the moment where you can save 10 percent if you spend more than \u00a360. Simply use the code SAVE10 at the checkout. It can be used on almost anything, including sunscreen. You can also get a bundle of three Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Protective Sun Lotion bottles for \u00a325.49 from Amazon. The SPF30 formula gets a 4.6 star rating from more than 160 reviews and has been bought more than 50 times in the past month.", "summary": "The Hawaiian Tropic Sun Lotion gave me and my kids all day protection and a 'luminous glow'", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/tried-5-aldi-hawaiian-tropic-29321138", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29321346.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ZCR_BEM_090624Aldijpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:09:33", "author": "Zoe Chamberlain", "authors": ["Zoe Chamberlain"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.137}

By contrast, most international pressure to end the war has placed the onus on Israel to halt its fighting in Gaza. Israel is increasingly isolated as the country faces genocide charges in the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court prosecutor is seeking the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\n\"Israel has offered a comprehensive proposal,\" Biden said. \"Now it's time to raise your voices and demand that Hamas come to the table,\" he said, addressing protesters and foreign leaders who have pressed for a ceasefire.\n\nThere was not yet any confirmation from Netanyahu's government of the deal. Israel's national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, reportedly told relatives of hostages that Israel would not agree to a deal to end the war in exchange for the hostages' release. Earlier this week, he predicted that the war would last until the end of the year.\n\nThe deal Biden described would start with a six-week ceasefire and the release of women, wounded and elderly hostages, as well as a withdrawal of Israeli forces from population centers, and the acceleration of the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, where the humanitarian crisis is believed to be cascading into a state of famine. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange.\n\nThe second phase of the deal would see the release of Israeli troops held by Hamas, and the final phase would release the bodies of hostages who were killed by Hamas or who died in captivity and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, more than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza. Israel says more than a third of that number are combatants, and has itself lost close to 300 soldiers in the war.\n\nBiden said Hamas would be incapacitated to the extent that it could not carry out another Oct. 7-style attack. Israel's aim in the war until now was the freeing of hostages and the destruction of Hamas. Biden, who did not take questions, did not say whether Hamas would have any role in the reconstruction he envisioned after the war.\n\n\"The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to your own security because they've devastated Hamas forces over the past eight months,\" he said. \"At this point. Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7, [which] is one of Israel's main objectives of this war and quite frankly a righteous one.\"\n\nBiden appeared to anticipate resistance from Israel's right wing, including from far-right ministers in Netanyahu's cabinet.\n\n\"I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan will call for the war to continue indefinitely,\" Biden said. \"Some are even in the government coalition, and they have made it clear they want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years, and hostages are not a priority. Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal.\"\n\nBiden held out the prospect of a comprehensive Middle East peace deal that would include normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia, long a key goal for Netanyahu.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_kampeas@jta.org", "name": "Ron Kampeas",

Gaza officials said 45 people were killed and about 250 wounded.\n\nThe White House however said this week that while the Israeli strike was \"devastating,\" it did not breach Biden's red lines for withholding weapons deliveries to the key US ally.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza\u2013Israel_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza\u2013Israel conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.rtl.lu/sassets/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2024/05/31/20/01b925fe5ad2da0ad8486e36988bf124.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615324", "eventUri": "eng-9615324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 844, "textEnd": 853}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Israel recently issued a new proposal to secure the hostages' release.\n\nThe president told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview this month that he would limit some US arms to Israel if the country's military \"go into Rafah.\"\n\nBut he has remained vague about how he will quantify such a decision, leading to frustrations and a degree of confusion over his stance. Many Democrats, along with foreign leaders who the US counts as allies, say Israel's actions clearly cross a red line - if not Biden's, then their own and those of international law.\n\nWhite House officials have sought this week to explain Biden's stance, suggesting his barometer for changing policy would be a \"major ground invasion\" of the city.\n\nA major ground invasion, national security spokesman John Kirby has said, would be obvious should it begin: \"Lots of units of tens of thousands of troops or thousands of troops moving in a coordinated set of maneuvers against a wide variety of targets on the ground in a massive way. That's a major ground operation. Pretty simple.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

In a statement Friday, Israel said its military found Hamas rocket launchers, tunnels and weapons being stored in central Rafah, though the AP reported the military hasn't specified where. Israel began its strike on Rafah earlier this month despite the U.S. and others encouraging it to not invade Rafah because of the humanitarian risks to the people seeking shelter and ongoing aid operations there. On Tuesday, U.S. national security communications advisor John Kirby said the scenes from Rafah are \"heartbreaking\" and \"horrific,\" but that the U.S. hadn't seen what it considers to be \"a major ground operation,\" which could lead Biden to \"make different decisions in terms of support.\"\n\nNegotiations for a cease-fire had stalled in recent weeks as Hamas and Israel have been unable to agree on terms, with Hamas saying Thursday that it wouldn't participate in negotiations while Israel continues its \"aggression\" in fighting, Reuters reported. On Wednesday, a senior Israeli official said it's likely the war will last through the end of this year. Israel and Gaza-based militant group Hamas have been fighting almost constantly since Oct. 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. Since then, it's estimated that more than 36,000 Palestinians have died as a result of the war, leading to increased calls for a cease-fire. Last week, the United Nation's highest court told Israel it had to \"immediately halt\" its military operation in Rafah and allow for humanitarian aid to the area. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained set on operating in Rafah, though, something he has said is necessary to totally defeat Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62499fdeb85d6719dc85cb1a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615324", "eventUri": "eng-9615324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 692, "textEnd": 698, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

What is it like working with Zac and Buster, the two dogs who play Colin? Patrick Brammall: Good. The roles they are playing are not a stretch. They are usually the most professional actors on set every time. Harriet Dyer: They\u2019re your supermarket brand good boys. In one episode, Patty had to manipulate the dog\u2019s mouth and do silly accents and the dog just let him do it for like 20 minutes. I would have bitten you. What has been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? PB: I saw Ewan McGregor at this thing in Los Angeles. I was like, I\u2019m going to go up to Ewan McGregor and tell him that Long Way Around inspired me to start riding a motorbike. I now love motorbikes. But as I was tapping him on the shoulder, I knew I\u2019d made the wrong decision. I said, \u201cHey mate, I just want to say \u2026 \u201d and I just started mumbling about motorbikes. And he turned away! I left that function pretty quickly. I mean, what did he care? I was just another white guy telling him, \u201cNow I have a Thruxton!\u201d What is the weirdest thing you\u2019ve done for love? PB: We got married, had a baby and did a show all at the same time. That\u2019s pretty weird. HD: I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. PB: It\u2019s gone well for us but it\u2019s pretty weird. It\u2019s not natural to do all that together. HD: I remember being in year 7 and I really liked a guy called Nick. Do you remember that Nickelodeon had a song that went [sings] \u201cNickelodeon Nation\u201d? I was swinging around a pole singing, \u201cNickelodeon Nation, I love Nick. Nick loves me, Nickelodeon Nation\u201d \u2013 hoping that he\u2019d recognise I was singing about him. It was so horrible. He just walked away and I was left there, just swinging on a little pole. PB: [pityingly] Oh, mate. What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? HD: It sounds silly. I literally count sheep jumping over a fence. [complete silence] No one else? Am I a psycho? PB: No one else! I just toss and turn until I go to sleep. HD: I fall asleep pretty much straight away. I always ask Patty if I looked adorable when he came to bed. PB: She always is. HD: How adorable was I last night? PB: So adorable. Can barely go to sleep for looking at you. What is the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received? HD: My grandmother Joan: \u201cWhat is for you won\u2019t go past you.\u201d Bang on every time. You cannot poke a hole in that. PB: I\u2019m gonna be making it up, sorry. I don\u2019t have anything HD: \u201cUse eye cream\u201d \u2013 said by your wife three weeks ago? PB: That was pretty good advice. Paying divs tonight. What is the ideal length of men\u2019s shorts? PB: I don\u2019t think we talk about this enough. Thank you for bringing it up. Let\u2019s do this. [stands up and gestures mid-thigh] I think the short short is coming back for men. HD: You should wear them more, you have good pins. You know, there was a man in Townsville who had an ice-cream van and his shorts were a little shorter than that and he didn\u2019t wear undies. And when he was like, \u201cDo you want nuts on that?\u201d \u2013 it was borderline. I hope they arrested him. PB: I hope he is not still selling ice-cream to kids. If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? HD: It\u2019s salami. It\u2019s olive tapenade. It\u2019s mozzarella. It\u2019s mushrooms. It\u2019s basically like a capricciosa pizza. You could even do capers, anchovies \u2013 it is a salt assault. PB: Sharp cheddar, tomato, mustard, Branston pickle, on sourdough. Bit of a ploughman\u2019s vibe. HD: You probably want a boiled egg. PB: What the hell are you talking about? Do you have a party trick? PB: I can juggle. HD: There\u2019s also that thing you do on the dancefloor that we probably can\u2019t say. With the cat. PB: Oh yeah. No, no. HD: It\u2019s an intense mime he does. He has stopped doing it at parties. I\u2019m pretty good at karaoke. I\u2019ve got a decent set of pipes. What\u2019s your go-to karaoke song? HD: All I Want for Christmas Is You, at any time of year. PB: My go-to karaoke song is The Confrontation from Les Mis\u00e9rables. HD: The guy who does songs from musicals at karaoke needs help. PB: He\u2019s a cool guy. Who do you want to play you in the biopic of your life? PB: Ryan Reynolds. And it is a big budget flick. HD: Goodness. Carey Mulligan? Maybe someone funnier. Natalie Portman, because we look so alike. Actually, Scarlett Johansson \u2013 we always get mistaken for each other. Actually no \u2013 Olivia Colman. If you see this, Olivia, do me, babes. Both seasons of Colin from Accounts are streaming on Binge in Australia.

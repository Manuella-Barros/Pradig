Cerone's experience with shows like The Blacklist and Dexter shows a bid to maintain the crime series' upward trajectory. Season 3 had to rework storytelling due to the sad passing of male lead Adam Canto, who played Thony's protector.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady has undergone a shakeup behind the scenes ahead of the show's return for a fourth season. Earlier in the year, Fox announced that the popular crime series had been renewed with a 12 episode order for a new season. The announcement also revealed a backstage shakeup with developer Miranda Kwok and Jeannine Renshaw who served as co-showrunners and executive producers on Season 3, exiting the show. In place of the departed duo, Deadline now reports that Fox and Warner Bros. Television have brought in Daniel Cerone, who will take over as executive producer and showrunner for the upcoming fourth season of The Cleaning Lady.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady has performed impressively since its premiere, and this latest shakeup points at a bid to maintain the show's upward trajectory, relying on experience. Cerone is an established, veteran television writer and producer whose credits include the crime drama, The Blacklist starring James Spader and Megan Boone, Showtime's 2006 drama, Dexter, CBS's The Mentalist, among others. While Cerone might be taking over the main reins for the show going forward, Kwok will be staying on as executive consultant on Season 4 while developing new projects for Warner Bros Television.\n\nBased on an Argentine series called La Chica Que Limpia, The Cleaning Lady centers on Thony De La Rosa portrayed by \u00c9lodie Yung (Daredevil), a former surgeon of Cambodian-Filipino descent, who is living, working and catering for her young son in Las Vegas, on an expired visa. Unable to take up a role suitable to her medical skills due to her immigration status, Thony takes up a role as a cleaning service worker alongside her sister-in-law, Fiona (Martha Millan). Things soon take a turn when Thony witnesses a murder, and is employed as a doctor and cleaning lady, by a criminal organization.\n\nThe Shakeup In Season 3\n\nThe popularity of The Cleaning Lady can't be overemphasized as the third season of the series averaged 3.6 million viewers across platforms. However, the storytelling for season 3 had to be reworked to accommodate the sad passing of its male lead, Adam Canto. Canto, who portrayed gangster Arman Morales, Thony's protector, sadly died after a battle with cancer earlier this year. The show had hoped to welcome him back after he had undergone treatment, with his character kidnapped and left offscreen in the season premiere. Sadly, he never made that comeback.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady also stars Eva De Dominici, Kate Del Castillo, Santiago Cabrera, Sean Lew, Faith Bryant, and Sebastien and Valentino LaSalle.\n\nThe first three seasons of The Cleaning Lady are available to stream on Hulu.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady\n\nRelease Date January 3, 2022\n\nCast Elodie Yung , Adan Canto , Martha Millan , Sean Lew , Sebastien LaSalle , Faith Bryant , Valentino LaSalle , Oliver Hudson\n\nMain Genre Crime\n\nSeasons 3\n\nCreator(s) Miranda Kwok\n\nNetwork FOX\n\nExpand\n\nWATCH ON HULU", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "makuochi_echebiri@collider.com", "name": "Makuochi Echebiri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cleaning_Lady_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Cleaning Lady (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cerone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cerone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blacklist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Blacklist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dexter (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Arman sacrificed himself to save Thony, a moment that honors Canto, who died of cancer in early 2024. Arman's absence will impact season 4, leaving a significant void in Thony's journey. But, despite the loss, the show could continue to pay tribute to Canto's legacy in future episodes.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady director Catriona McKenzie has explained Arman's death in season 3 of the show, including how it paid tribute to the death of his actor, Adan Canto, who died in early 2024. Canto had portrayed the Los Angeles gangster since the series began, but was absent throughout The Cleaning Lady season 3's story. That was until episode 6, when he sacrificed himself to save Thony from one of the people who'd previously captured him, resulting in the car he was in driving off a bridge. His final, noble action was saving the show's main protagonist.\n\nSpeaking with Screen Rant, McKenzie explained why Arman's death in The Cleaning Lady season 3 happened the way it did, as well as how it honors Canto's time on the series. The director revealed how the moment cemented his character as a hero, acting as a positive sendoff despite the tragic circumstances. Check out what McKenzie had to say below:\n\nOne of the things that I'm good at is I'm really good at leading with a sense of compassion. As a director, you fall into the engine that is a show in its third season show. It's an engine that is up and running, and it's a very tight-knit crew and a crew that are grieving.\n\nI'm good at doing action, and I knew they wanted to really honor Adan's life and give his character a good sendoff. He sacrifices himself as a hero, so we did the Thelma and Louise thing and sent him off the cliff. It was quite a technical thing to do, but everyone obviously wanted to give him that moment. It was very sad for everyone -- and particularly Elodie [Yung], who had to do that scene on the cliff's edge. It was devastating for her, but she's such a professional.\n\nI guess it's about being very calm and very precise and very gentle. I do think that, when you're directing, you have to remember that actors are not machines. They're living, breathing human beings with a life and feelings and insecurities. I just think kindness is key. To be kind to another human that has to step in and do the work is civilized and gracious.\n\nHow Arman's Absence Will Impact The Cleaning Lady Season 4\n\nFollowing Arman's sacrifice, the episode cuts to when he and Thony slow-danced and kissed in Mexico, all the way back in season 1. The episode is then dedicated to Canto, who died of appendiceal cancer back in January 2024. The emotional resonance of the scene not only hits because of how important his character was to the show, but also because of the actor's death. It makes his character's sacrifice all the more memorable, as it will be the last time he's seen onscreen.\n\nArman's death had a major impact on Thony for the rest of season 3, even as the story threads began to converge on different elements of the show. Given Canto's death at the start of 2024, the actor's absence had already been felt throughout the latest episodes. Going into The Cleaning Lady season 4, however, there will be a more empty space for his character than there ever was before. This means the next episodes will likely see the protagonist continue trying to process how he sacrificed himself to save her.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best TV Shows Like The Cleaning Lady\n\nCrime drama doesn't get any better than The Cleaning Lady, but these similarly electric TV shows will quench the thirst of fans looking for more.\n\nDespite the heavy loss The Cleaning Lady has endured, the show's continuation will no doubt honor Canto and the contributions he made to the series as Arman. Although there will be a major absence felt in the show moving forward, it can still pay tribute to his legacy in ways that honor everything he gave to the series. With the show's story gearing up for even more exciting, harrowing moments, Thony's journey feels like it's only just beginning.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady season 4 will begin on Fox at a later date.\n\nThe Cleaning Lady\n\nTV-MA\n\nCrime\n\nDrama\n\nThriller\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nCast Elodie Yung , Adan Canto , Martha Millan , Sean Lew , Sebastien LaSalle , Faith Bryant , Valentino LaSalle , Oliver Hudson\n\nRelease Date January 3, 2022\n\nSeasons 3\n\nMain Genre Crime\n\nCreator(s) Miranda Kwok", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_bythrow@screenrant.com", "name": "Nick Bythrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cleaning_Lady_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Cleaning Lady (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adan_Canto", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adan Canto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catriona_McKenzie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catriona McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Fire_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Fire (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennyworth_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennyworth (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Kwok", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miranda Kwok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_parental_guidelines_(US)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TV parental guidelines (US)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cl-3-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725306", "eventUri": "eng-9725306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

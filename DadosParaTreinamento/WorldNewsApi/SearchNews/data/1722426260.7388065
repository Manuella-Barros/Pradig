I\u2019m a user\u2019", "text": "Earlier this week the Health Research Board (HRB) revealed that, along with recording the highest number of drug treatment cases on record last year, there has been a sharp increase in cocaine use among women. Responding to the HRB findings, Labour TD Alan Kelly expressed concern that use of the illegal drug is starting to be viewed as acceptable across Irish society, and called on Government to lead a campaign with other organisations to challenge that perception. \u201cWe have a real issue with the so-called middle classes in this country creating a narrative that cocaine use is okay,\u201d he said. We spoke to some women about their personal experience of using the illegal drug. \u2018I hate this misconception that people who take recreational drugs are just scumbags\u2019 Emma* is in her late 30s and says she uses cocaine \u201ca few times a year\u201d which is less frequently than she used to. Cocaine inevitably leads to a \u201clong session\u201d, with nights out continuing until 5am or 6am, and that\u2019s hard to manage with \u201ckids that have to be looked after the next day,\u201d she says. She tends to use now only when there\u2019s someone to watch her young child the next morning, or if she\u2019s on a weekend away. She started using cocaine when she was on her early 20s and took it at house parties, gigs and festivals. Initially she was scared to take the drug, but she watched her friends taking drugs without any serious adverse effects, which made her feel more confident. She uses it now in many of the same settings, although the opportunity to do so has diminished because of her family situation. \u201cI\u2019m a wife. I\u2019m a mother. I have a career. I\u2019m a responsible adult. I hate this misconception that people who take recreational drugs are just scumbags,\u201d she says. She and her husband take cocaine together sometimes, she says. She says she is not afraid of something happening to them as a consequence of taking the drug. \u201cIf anything I\u2019m more worried about feeling sick the next day or that I\u2019d be too hungover.\u201d She\u2019s aware of the criminal activities fuelled by drugs, and believes cocaine should be decriminalised. \u201cIt\u2019s criminalised by our legal system and for me that\u2019s the issue,\u201d she says. She has never worried about becoming addicted and has no plans to stop using cocaine. \u2018Overdosing never crosses my mind, probably because I\u2019ve had a good bit of alcohol\u2019 Sophie* is 30 years old. She started using cocaine when she was 26, taking it for the first time at a house party. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a huge amount of thought went into it,\u201d she says. She had been drinking beforehand. The cocaine made her feel more confident but also very anxious, but says she has never done anything she regrets while high. That party wasn\u2019t the first time she had been offered cocaine. A couple of years earlier, while working in a bank, she was offered cocaine by colleagues, including a manager, she says, while on a work night out. She says she takes cocaine a few times a year and gets it through people that her friends know. But she wouldn\u2019t be afraid to go through a dealer herself, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been there when they bought it. It\u2019s just very normal people ... If I met them on the street, I\u2019d just think they had an ordinary job. That they were not involved in any form of criminality.\u201d She has been present when a fellow partygoer overdosed and almost died. This frightened her. Still, about six months later, she took cocaine again. \u201cIt [overdosing] never crosses my mind in the moment, probably because I\u2019ve had a good bit of alcohol beforehand,\u201d she says. She only ever takes cocaine after she has been drinking alcohol. The last time Sophie bought a bag of cocaine it cost her \u20ac60-\u20ac80 per gramme, which she feels is cheap enough if you\u2019re working. \u201cI don\u2019t like the whole industry behind it,\u201d she says. It has been a few months since she last used, because of this. \u201cI\u2019m not saying never again,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not something I want to contribute to ... fun and all as it is.\u201d \u2018Nobody knew in work. They hadn\u2019t a clue\u2019 Olive* is in her 40s. She says she started using cocaine following a bereavement. She drank heavily at first and met a new group of friends who were regular cocaine users, and she began to join in. She was in her mid-20s at this stage and took cocaine most weekends for a couple of years. But she says she never recognised she had a problem because she was never the one buying the drug. She felt \u201cconfident and buzzed\u201d when on cocaine, unlike the extremely vulnerable positions she had found herself in when she was drinking. She stayed out until 6am or 7am on a cocaine high, and would have sex with a man from the group at 6am and \u201cfelt brilliant\u201d, she says. She never had bad comedowns. Sometimes she\u2019d do a \u201ctwo-day bender\u201d at the weekend, staying out all Sunday night until 6am. \u201cAnd I would go to work on the Monday morning, and I would drive. Nobody knew in work. They hadn\u2019t a clue,\u201d she says. On one occasion she went to \u201can old man\u2019s pub\u201d with her friends. The group decided to buy cocaine and they took it while surrounded by carvery lunches and older people drinking pints, she says. She didn\u2019t get \u201cthe same buzz\u201d and thought \u201cthis is not what I want to do with this drug\u201d. She realised her friends were \u201ca bit addicted\u201d, whereas she associated cocaine with \u201cparty central\u201d. Olive says she never thought of the more sinister side of who or what she was funding through her cocaine use. \u201cIt never entered my head. And I only did it with these people [new friends] so I trusted them. They would have had a lot of money, so they would have got the best that they could get,\u201d she says. She never thought about the potential dangers of taking cocaine either. Olive moved to the UK for a period. She met her partner, who is also Irish, while there. An opportunity to take cocaine arose while out one night, but this time her reaction to the drug was different. Witnessing this, her partner threatened to end the relationship if she ever took cocaine again. So she stopped. She and her partner moved back to Dublin several years ago and have children together now. She has stayed away from cocaine and doesn\u2019t believe she would touch it again, but says she has \u201cthought about it\u201d. The addiction expert: \u2018People lose control of their relationship with cocaine\u2019 Prof Bobby Smyth, chair of the Addiction Faculty at the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, says the number one concern in relation to cocaine usage is that \u201cpeople might lose control of their relationship with cocaine and develop an addiction\u201d. For those who use cocaine on a regular basis \u201ca third of them will develop an addiction,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re at increased risk of having a heart attack ... increased risk of a stroke,\u201d Prof Smyth explains. In cases where emergency departments are seeing events like this in relatively young people, there\u2019s a suspicion \u201ca drug like cocaine is involved. It\u2019s contributing to some presentation of cardiovascular problems at young ages\u201d. For anyone with any underlying mental health problems, cocaine usage can have an exacerbating effect, he says. But it also has the short-term effect of squeezing \u201call the happy chemicals out of your brain\u201d, meaning for those who use heavily at the weekend \u201cthere\u2019s less of those natural happy chemicals to get you through the beginning of the following week\u201d. \u201cWhen people are intoxicated and dis-inhibited they can behave in pretty reckless and self-destructive manners,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn those intoxicated states people can engage in impulsive acts, so can contribute to self-harm. It can also, of course, contribute to violence against other people.\u201d [ Cocaine as easy to get as pizza in rural Galway, says FG councillor ] In terms of damage to the nose, Prof Smyth explains that cocaine \u201ccauses the blood vessels in the nose to narrow\u201d and also \u201chas a local anaesthetic effect\u201d. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re snorting the cocaine with, you can ram that into your nose and you won\u2019t feel anything. It can allow you damage your nose, not notice the damage while also damaging the blood vessels in your nose, which means they don\u2019t get a chance to repair\u201d. In extreme cases this can mean the septum, the wall that divides one nostril from the other \u201ceventually just erodes away\u201d, he says. *Names have been changed.", "summary": "With the Health Research Board reporting a sharp increase in cocaine use among women, three women describe their use of the drug", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2024/06/29/cocaine-and-irish-women-im-a-wife-im-a-mother-i-have-a-career-im-a-user/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/bhRqjY6QvzPHK1MwzPMoM7RfNg4=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/BZKOMOUUIJCMXLS4UU3LIUJKPE.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:00", "author": "Jen Hogan", "authors": ["Jen Hogan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.191}

BYU officially announced his signing on Tuesday.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Catchings, who recently took a visit to Provo, was coached at Overtime Elite by one of BYU's assistant coaches, Tim Fanning.\n\n\"We are so excited to welcome Kanon to BYU. He's a great young man,\" Young said in a press release announcing Catchings' signing.\n\n\"Kanon's a big-time talent who brings great size, shooting, and athleticism to Provo. He has basketball in his blood, and we are equally as excited to welcome his family. His defensive ability is as impressive as his offensive talent. We can't wait to get Kanon on campus and get to work with our players and staff. We look forward to helping him develop and thrive in our program.\"\n\nCatchings is rated the No. 40 overall prospect nationally in the 2024 recruiting class in 247 Sports' composite rankings.\n\nHe comes from a strong basketball family: Catchings is the nephew of Naismith Hall of Famer Tamika Catchings, a former WNBA MVP and 10-time All-Star. His mother, Tauja, played collegiately at Illinois and was a WNBA draft pick, while grandfather Harvey Catchings played 11 seasons in the NBA.\n\nLast season while playing at Overtime Elite, Kanon Catchings averaged 15.3 points and 6.2 rebounds, according to ESPN. He also shot 37% from 3-point range for the Cold Hearts team coached by Fanning.\n\nWhy did Kanon Catchings choose BYU?\n\nESPN's Jonathan Givony caught up with Catchings to talk about why he is taking his talents to Provo.\n\n\"My family and I met with coach Young and the coaching staff last week and we immediately clicked,\" Catchings told Givony. \"I knew right away this was the best fit for me.\"\n\nCatchings signed with BYU one day after the school officially announced it had signed Egor Demin, an international prospect who is a projected 2025 draft pick. Catchings also visited Florida State and NC State before committing to BYU, Givony reported.\n\n\"Coach Young emphasizes building relationships and I have complete trust in him,\" Catchings said. \"I'm excited to learn from him and improve as a player. We have a great group of guys on the roster and we all share the same goal. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nWhy is Kanon Catchings' signing so significant for BYU?\n\nCatchings has a 0.9849 recruiting ranking in the 247 Sports' composite metric, making him the highest signee in program history since that metric was used.\n\nIn their 2024 class, the Cougars also have the No. 5 and No. 8 highest recruiting rated players in school history, per the 247 Sports' metric -- power forward Brody Kozlowski (No. 5) has a 0.9593 rating, while point guard Elijah Crawford (No. 8) has a 0.9458 rating.\n\nLike Catchings, both Kozlowski (USC) and Crawford (Stanford) -- also four-star recruits -- previously signed with other colleges before reopening their recruitment.\n\nThat doesn't include Demin, who isn't rated as a recruit by 247 Sports as an international prospect.\n\nWith Catchings' addition, BYU jumped to No. 12 nationally in 247 Sports' team recruiting rankings for the 2024 freshman class and third among Big 12 teams, behind only Arizona State (No. 4) and Baylor (No. 7).\n\nBYU has also added two transfers this offseason in former Utah center Keba Keita and former Rutgers power forward Mawot Mag.\n\nWith Catchings' signing, BYU still has one scholarship remaining to fill.", "source": {"uri": "deseret.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deseret News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_judd@deseret.com", "name": "Brandon Judd", "type":

The Overtime Elite prospect is expected to be a one-and-done player in college. He was previously committed to Purdue.\n\nCatching fills BYU's need to add a scoring threat in the front court. At 6-foot-9, Catchings has the ability to stretch the floor. He averaged nearly 15 points a game at Overtime Elite and has the ability to score in bunches.\n\nHe scored more 20 points three times last year. He did that while shooting 36% from three and 54% from the floor.\n\nWhen Catchings decommitted from Purdue, BYU quickly landed on his radar. Young hired former Overtime Elite coach Tim Fanning to his staff last month. Fanning worked with Catchings last year.\n\nCatchings has deep basketball ties. He is related to Tamika Catchings, the Hall of Fame basketball player who was a WNBA MVP. His father played professionally and his mother, Tauja, was one of the best players in the Big Ten during her time at Illinois.\n\nCatchings is the second freshman signed by Young who is likely a one-and-done player. Russian prospect Egor Demin is expected to be a lottery pick. He's also a 6-foot-9 scorer who played 21 games last season for Real Madrid.\n\nYoung now has three ESPN top 100 players on the roster, plus Demin.

High School Basketball Ini Hs Basketball New Castle Semistate Final / Grace Hollars/IndyStar / USA TODAY\n\nTop-40 prospect and former Purdue signee Kanon Catchings has announced he is committed to BYU, which lands them their highest recruit in over a decade, according to On3. Catchings, a 6-foot-9 small forward, will give BYU a very unique and highly skilled forward to build the future of the program around.\n\nCatchings leads a very protrusive and talented freshman class joining the Cougars in 2024. BYU landed four-star PG, Elijah Crawford; four-star SF, Brody Kozlowski; and a three-star SG, Brooks Bahr.\n\nKanon is the nephew of former legendary WNBA player Tamika Catchings. He is building into having an NBA frame and style of play that will transfer to the collegiate and potentially the professional level. Catchings originally signed his letter of intent to attend the Purdue Boilermakers but decided to step back and reevaluate the best options and situations for him, and that's when he landed at BYU.\n\nHe spent last season playing with Overtime Elite, which is the route we have seen many high schoolers take. Catchings has the ability to be a three-way scorer, with a smooth jumper from inside and outside the arc. He is still filling out his frame but could be a lengthy wing with the outlet of playing the four in certain instances. Right now, his game resembles more of a small forward.\n\nLast season with Overtime Elite, Catchings averaged 14.4 points, 1.1 assists, and 5.7 rebounds while shooting 54.5% from the field and 36.2% from the three-point line. He averaged roughly 23 minutes per game. BYU is getting a very highly sought-after prospect who will and can contribute a great deal right out of the gate for the cougars.\n\nWith Catchings on board, this should be the last offseason signing for BYU Basketball, a solid first couple of months in the Coach Kevin Young era.", "source": {"uri": "bustingbrackets.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Busting Brackets"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He was ranked the third best prospect in Georgia in the 2024 class and a top 10 player nationally at his position. Catchings has premier length at 6'9 and he has the ability to his threes, make plays off the dribble, and play above the rim. His combination of size and skill will allow him to play a variety of positions at the college level.\n\nBYU only had two more scholarships to fill on the 2024-2025 roster.

There's not a lot of room in the rotation as it stands today, but Catchings is talented enough to push for minutes. He can play the stretch four or he could also play the three. His length, alongside projected lottery pick Egor Demin, could give new BYU coach Kevin a lot of length in the backcourt.

He's a projected first-round pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.\n\nCatchings will lead BYU's 2024 recruiting class also featuring point guard Elijah Crawford, small forward Brody Kozlowski, and shooting guard Brooks Bahr. Egor Demin, a potential 2025 lottery pick from Russia, also signed with Young's Cougars this week.\n\n\"Coach Young emphasizes building relationships and I have complete trust in him,\" Catchings said. \"I'm excited to learn from him and improve as a player. We have a great group of guys on the roster and we all share the same goal. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nRelated: BYU Star Jaxson Robinson Announces Transfer Commitment", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brigham Young University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_Elite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime Elite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BYU Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Recruiting_and_Retention", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Recruiting and Retention", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/a6/aa63a1a3-f8d4-52e8-906f-b2a0b62bfc92/6671fafc7b8fc.image.png?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C33&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662504", "eventUri": "eng-9662504", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

A year later, Catchings has embarked on a different journey - one that took him through Atlanta for his senior year at Overtime Elite - and now to Provo, Utah.\n\nThe 6-9 Catchings, who averaged 15.3 points on 37% shooting and 6.2 rebounds per game for the Cold Heart team of the Overtime Elite league, committed to BYU on Tuesday. Catchings, committed to Purdue following his sophomore year at Brownsburg before breaking off that pledge earlier this month, a few days before freshmen reported to West Lafayette.\n\nCatchings visited BYU, Florida State and North Carolina State in a process his mother, Tauja, compared to a \"speed dating\" version of recruiting.\n\n\"It's been an interesting ride,\" Tauja Catchings said. \"To being gone his senior year to going out to Utah, it's not what we expected. But we trust God's timing and he's got Kanon.\"\n\nKanon, the nephew of former Tennessee and Indiana Fever star Tamika Catchings, a member for the Naismith Basketball of Fame, is projected by ESPN NBA draft expert Jonathan Givony as a potential one-and-done college player and first-round draft pick next summer. Kevin Young, hired at BYU in April, appeared to be on track to becoming an NBA head coach and was a finalist for the Brooklyn Nets job just before taking the position at BYU, which was vacated when Mark Pope was hired by Kentucky.\n\nYoung was most recently an associate head coach with Phoenix Suns.\n\nTauja Catchings said originally after the departure from Purdue, she expected Kanon would likely return to Overtime Elite for a year and then either pursue professional or college basketball.\n\n\"That was what we were kind of thinking,\" Tauja said. \"He had great relationships there and that would be a natural fit. Then we got a lot of calls and a lot of schools were interested, which kind of surprised me. You kind of assume every team is pretty much filled by that point. You try to build relationships quickly. I told Kanon it was kind like an episode of the 'Bachelor' or something, but it was a good experience for him to go through it. I think a lot of people probably don't realize he kind of rushed through it the first time.\"\n\nCatchings had a connection at BYU. His coach at Overtime Elite with the Cold Hearts was Tim Fanning, who Young hired as an assistant coach. Tauja said that connection does help \"the comfort level\" of committing to BYU but was not the deciding factor.\n\n\"We had a Zoom call with them and met coach Young,\" she said. \"I love that he's a family man and a man of faith, first and foremost. And he's been where Kanon is trying to go in the NBA as a coach for many years. He has a lot of experience and could help prepare Kanon and other players who have NBA aspirations.\"\n\nCatchings, ranked as the No. 40 player in the country in the 247sports composite list, will move to BYU this weekend and get started on preparations for his freshman season. He averaged 17.5 points and 4.8 rebounds as a junior at Brownsburg and would have been one of the frontrunners for IndyStar Mr. Basketball as a senior.\n\nTauja, who was Illinois Miss Basketball in 1996 and went on to star at Illinois in college, said her family has \"nothing but respect for Purdue\" and cited Kanon's close relationship for assistant coach Brandon Brantley as the most difficult part of moving on from the Boilermakers.\n\n\"Purdue is an exceptional program,\" Tauja said. \"Kanon's goal when he committed to Purdue was just to play college basketball. His goal now is to play in the NBA. Purdue has been more of a traditional program, which I like. I played four years at Illinois. But I think Kanon as probably looking for a program that can support his timeline.\"\n\nTauja said she is \"heartbroken he's not going to be 45 minutes from home,\" but said Kanon's experience at Overtime Elite probably allowed him to take another look at his future.\n\n\"I think it's something that has been weighing on him for probably the past year,\" she said. \"I don't believe everything came as a surprise to Purdue. I think going away to Overtime Elite allowed him to spread his wings and opened his eyes a little more. He was able to reevaluate everything. He's 18 now and committed when he was 16. It's been hard on him. His roots are here in Indiana, and he has a lot of ties here. But I'm proud of him.\"\n\nThere are forks in the road that are tough to navigate in life. But with the vantage point of hindsight, Tauja said Kanon's move to Overtime Elite was a positive. Now he is on to his next adventure in Utah.\n\n\"For Kanon, it was not just basketball,\" she said. \"It was pushing him out of the nest and helping with his maturity. He needed to grow and mature. I would have been terrified sending Kanon from our house to college. But having that year in between helped build him up academically. They really poured a lot into the players and build them up. He had ups and downs but was able to end on a positive note.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com",

His replacement seems to be doing just fine.\n\nMark Pope, the head coach who led the Cougars to the NCAA Tournament last season, accepted a role at his alma mater in April leaving the program unexpectedly coachless this spring.\n\nThat move was set in motion after SMU fired second-year coach Rob Lanier. An incredible domino effect would soon be seen as USC's Andy Enfield took the gig in Dallas, leading Eric Musselman to bail on Arkansas for the West Coast, followed by John Calipari filling the Razorbacks' opening.\n\nKentucky swung and missed on a number of big-time candidates before eventually settling on Pope, who was fresh off a first-round postseason exit.\n\nBYU hired Kevin Young as his replacement, a decision that's paid immediate dividends on the recruiting trail.\n\nWhile Pope was able to convince some talent to follow him to Lexington, Young did an excellent job of keeping the roster mostly intact.\n\nNow, he's adding to it.\n\nHaving already brought in international combo guard Egor Demin, a potential lottery pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, he's now secured a commitment from a second possible one-and-done player.\n\nCatchings, who committed to Purdue following his sophomore year of high school, elected to reopen his recruitment earlier this month. He visited Florida State and North Carolina State as well as BYU before picking the Cougars.\n\n\"Coach Young emphasizes building relationships and I have complete trust in him,\" Catchings said. \"I'm excited to learn from him and improve as a player. We have a great group of guys on the roster, and we all share the same goal. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nKanon Catchings, once committed to Purdue, is on his way to BYU. He'll provide the Cougars with a versatile scorer and rebounder that already has NBA scouts salivating.\n\nCatchings has big-time basketball ties, with his mom (Tauja) having starred at Illinois, his aunt (Tamika) having excelled in the WNBA, and his grandfather (Harvey) having played in the NBA.\n\nHe'll look to be the next in line!\n\nCatchings will now join a loaded BYU class with six basketball prospects that boast four-star status by at least one of the major recruiting services.\n\nNot bad for a guy who's been on the job for two months!", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com",

The 2021 Women's Basketball Hall of Famer was later promoted to vice president of basketball operations and general manager for the Fever. She left that post in 2022.\n\nCatchings, a former University of Tennessee standout and four-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist, has been a television analyst for women's college basketball for ESPN and the SEC Network since 2017.\n\nShe became the owner of Tea's Me Cafe in early 2017 and has added two locations in Indianapolis. She has now launched bottled teas to retailers.\n\nCatchings said she has been a tea drinker since childhood, when her mother would make sun tea. As an adult, she drinks more hot tea.\n\n\"Tea has been a vital part of calming me down and keeping me centered around the family values we had,\" said Catchings, who lives on the west side of Indianapolis. \"It played such an important role in my life.\"\n\nCatchings heard about Tea's Me Cafe, 140 E. 22nd St., from a fan in 2005.\n\n\"I went in there and met the owners and it became my space I would go to,\" Catchings said. \"I was having a meeting when I heard the owners were moving and shutting it down.\"\n\nCatchings decided to purchase it and then opened a location at 3967 N. Illinois St. in the Butler Tarkington Park in 2021, followed by a third one at Ivy Tech, 2535 N. Capitol Ave., in 2023. The cafe serves breakfast, lunch and desserts.\n\nIn 2023, Catchings took Tea's Me Cafe into the retail market. The bottled teas include Pomegranate Blueberry and Keywine (herbal teas), Summer Blush and Tropical Cyclone (green teas) and Kenya (black tea).\n\nThe teas are sold at Meijer stores in Zionsville, Westfield, Noblesville, Carmel and Indianapolis (96th Street). Catchings said Kroger, Market District and Fresh Thyme sell the teas.\n\nA percentage of the sales from the bottled teas are donated to the Catch the Stars Foundation, which Catchings founded with her sister, Tauja Catchings, 20 years ago. Tauja played at the University of Illinois. Their father, Harvey Catchings, played 11 seasons in the NBA.\n\nCatch the Stars provides underprivileged youth with fitness, literacy and mentoring programs.\n\n\"We've given $950,000 in scholarship money in the combined 20 years of the foundation,\" Catchings said.\n\nCatchings played 15 seasons with the Fever, leading the team to the 2012 WNBA title.\n\n\"It's just been a journey and a transition like it has for a lot of us,\" Catchings said of former players. \"The benefit and blessing have been the foundation. My life even growing up has been about basketball and service and impact. One of my dreams was to have my own basketball camp.\"\n\nAfter tearing her ACL her senior year at Tennessee, she sat out her 2001 rookie year with the Fever while rehabbing and got to know Indianapolis.\n\n\"We did our first basketball camp in 2001 and this will be our 23rd year,\" she said. \"The tea shop has given us the opportunity to hire high school students and for a lot of them it's their first job. We can help them grow and learn. Our three pillars of foundation are fitness, literacy and youth empowerment.\"\n\nCatchings is delighted to see WNBA attendance grow with the arrival of Fever rookie star Caitlin Clark, along with rookies such as the Chicago Sky's Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardosa.\n\n\"I love watching the WNBA continue to grow,\" she said. \"There are so many great young players who have been able to come out of this class at an unprecedented time.\"\n\nCatchings said it's great to see Fever fans rejuvenated with the attention Clark receives. The Fever have not made the playoffs since Catchings retired.\n\n\"(The fans are) coming alive. During our runs there were a lot of people there with us when we won the championship in 2012 and when we went back in 2015,\" Catchings said. \"It's been a couple of rocky years (since), but I'm really excited about the future of the Fever. They still need some time to figure out how to play together. I hope the city gives our team grace.\"", "source": {"uri": "youarecurrent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Current Publishing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_ambrogi@youarecurrent.com", "name": "Mark

On Tuesday, the former Purdue commit announced that he has signed with BYU.\n\nCatchings had been committed to Purdue for over a year and appeared to be on his way to West Lafayette to play for Matt Painter. However, in early June, the forward out of Brownsburg, Ind. asked for a release from his scholarship.\n\nPainter granted the request, allowing Catchings to pursue opportunities elsewhere. He found a home in Provo and will continue his basketball career at BYU.\n\n\"Kanon has asked for his release from his scholarship and we have granted him that request,\" Painter said in a statement. \"We wish him luck in his future endeavors.\"\n\nBYU is coming off a 2023-24 campaign in which it finished 23-11, including a 10-8 mark in Big 12 play. The Cougars finished tied for fifth in the league standings and reached the quarterfinal round of the conference tournament.\n\nBYU also reached the NCAA Tournament as a No. 6 seed, but lost to No. 11 seed Duquesne 71-67 in the first round.\n\nCatchings' commitment to BYU adds an element of interest for Purdue fans during the 2024-25 season. Both the Boilermakers and Cougars are participants in this year's Rady Children's Invitational, scheduled for Nov. 28-29. There's a chance the two teams could face each other in the multi-team event.\n\nThe event will be played at LionTree Arena in San Diego, Calif.\n\nAlthough losing Catchings from the 2024 recruiting class was a blow for Purdue, the Boilermakers are still in great shape. Painter assembled a strong five-man class, which includes four-star guard Gicarri Harris and four-star center Danield Jacobsen.\n\nOther members of Purdue's 2024 recruiting class include three-star forward/center Raleigh Burgess, three-star guard CJ Cox and three-star shooting guard Jack Benter.\n\nRelated stories on Purdue basketball\n\nZACH EDEY APPEARS IN KFC COMMERCIAL: Zach Edey the actor?

Purdue coach Matt Painter, though, said he took the departure in stride. Regardless of the juncture, the fit must be right for both program and player.\n\n\"If something happened, it would be one thing -- but nothing happened,\" Painter said Thursday after a summer practice. \"It's just one of those deals where he was concerned about his role and just wanted out of his letter -- and then kind of went back the next day and said everything was good.\n\nDOYEL: Kanon Catchings leaving Purdue was best for him -- and for Boilers\n\n\"It just was like, this is probably better than we can kind of part ways if you're questioning things before things start.\"\n\nCatchings committed to Purdue as a sophomore at Brownsburg. He spent his senior season with Overtime Elite in Georgia. The program announced June 6 it had granted his request for a release. The 6-8 small forward, a four-star top-40 prospect, is considered by some a fast-track NBA player.\n\nCatchings announced his commitment to BYU last Monday. His mother, Tauja, told IndyStar her son was \"looking for a program that can support his timeline\" relative to the NBA. BYU coach Kevin Young most recently served as associate head coach of the Phoenix Suns. Tim Fanning, Catchings' coach with Overtime Elite last season, also is now a BYU assistant.\n\nIf that timeline involved the guarantee of a big 2024-25 role in which to showcase his talents, Painter was not inclined to change a long-standing practice of letting those situations play out organically.\n\n\"I think every freshman that comes in has those uncertain thoughts,\" Painter said. \"But you know, you compete and earn your way into a role. I can't anoint a role to somebody out of thin air. You walk in, you compete.\n\n\"Zach Edey didn't have a role. Fletcher Loyer didn't have a role. They came in here and they earned what they got. And that's the way it is.\"\n\nThe other five members of Purdue's incoming class enrolled as scheduled. Daniel Jacobsen, Raleigh Burress, CJ Cox and Jack Benter practiced on Cardinal Court on Thursday. Gicarri Harris is in Tucson, Ariz., this week trying out for Team Mexico.\n\nPainter went so far as to call Catchings' late separation \"no big deal\" -- a comment on the necessity to prioritize culture and process and not a denigration of the player's talent.\n\nPurdue has embarked on an offseason endeavor to replace the star power or important role player contributions of Edey, Mason Gillis and Ethan Morton. With any chance Catchings' expectations could turn into a distraction, another destination made sense for all parties.\n\n\"More than anything, it's just the happiness of your players and the happiness of your team,\" Painter said. \"It's competition and it's difficult. But if right away you sense you're starting off on the wrong foot and somebody wants out of their letter, it's probably best to go separate ways. We wish him good luck and hope everything works out for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com",

Whatever is in the secret sauce, it's working.\n\nKanon Catchings\n\nFanning was Catchings' coach at Overtime Elite and has nothing but high praise for the young man. Catchings is a top 40 recruit who is talented enough to get minutes on day one. He brings length, athleticism and offense to the roster. What else does he bring to the team, and what drew him to BYU?\n\nDistraction-Free Environment\n\nOne of the unique aspects of playing at BYU is the honor code, which requires students and players to follow specific rules if they want to maintain eligibility. Fanning mentioned his early expectations of the added difficulty this would cause in recruiting, saying that he thought it was going to be an obstacle.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes seen as a recruiting hurdle, it appears that the opportunity to play in an environment with fewer distractions has been a key selling point for at least a few of BYU's recent signees.\n\nIn the interview, Fanning emphasized how important that kind of environment is for Catchings: \"He's a guy with really high aspirations, and he's very serious about basketball. Some things that deter other guys are really attractive to him.\"\n\nWhile it's often much easier said than done, when the entire roster is committed to that kind of high standard, it elevates the whole team.\n\nLove of the Game\n\nAnother point of emphasis for Fanning was Catchings' love of the game. It's something you can't teach, and is one of the best predictors of longevity in a playing career. When asked by scouts about the top NBA prospect at OTE during his time there, Fanning would point to Catchings: \"As a coach, you'd always rather try to get a guy to turn it down than to constantly get him to turn it up. He loves to hoop.\"\n\nUnselfishness\n\n\"He's a prolific scorer, but he's really unselfish.\" If you watched BYU basketball last season, you know that description could fit most of the starting lineup, including Jaxson Robinson, Trevin Knell, and Spencer Johnson, among others. Mark Pope built his offense around unselfishness, always encouraging the extra pass, and looking for the open shot.\n\nIn describing Catchings, Fanning underscored that Kanon is an extremely unselfish player. As a scorer he's naturally always looking for his next bucket, but his high IQ allows him to find the open man consistently. With that kind of mentality, he'll fit right in.\n\nEgor Demin\n\nIt's hard not to be excited about a guy who is arguably BYU's most talented pickup of all time, and a projected 2025 first-round draft pick. Again, Fanning emphasized unselfishness and dedication to the game as two things that stand out to him about Demin.\n\n\"Egor is a fantastic basketball players, really enjoys finding his teammates. One of the things that I've enjoyed watching with him is just how good of a passer he is.\" \"It's not normal that you get a 6'9\" point guard, that can play pick and roll, does a lot of different things.\"\n\n\"He's another guy, like with Kanon, that being in an environment that allows him to lock in on basketball is something that was attractive for him.\"\n\nA pattern is starting to emerge here. KY and his coaching staff are bringing in players who are unselfish and dedicated to honing their craft in a distraction-free environment.\n\nManaging the Point Guard Position\n\nWith so many versatile and talented players on the roster, it makes you wonder what role each one will play. Which players will get the minutes and who will lead the offense?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Kevin Young is looking to keep things flexible, utilizing each guy for the things they do best. Fanning confirmed this, saying \"I think how KY is envisioning playing offensively is that there's not a lot of differentiation between positions 1-4.\"\n\nWith a healthy balance of veteran players and talented up-and-comers, it's important to have leaders like Dallin Hall, who know the BYU culture, on and off the court. \"Egor and Elijah are freshmen and there's probably going to be some growing pains along the way, so I expect Dallin to help them get through some stuff and maximize their potential.\"\n\nThis is an exciting time for BYU basketball, and there's a lot to do this offseason to prep for a big upcoming season in the Big 12. If KY and his staff have shown us anything, it's that they are up for the challenge.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brigham Young University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_Elite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime Elite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_honor_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academic honor code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Young_(poet)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Young (poet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top 40"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5930,h_3335,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cougs_daily/01j0vdmgacxq51bc2q0v.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662504", "eventUri": "eng-9662504", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

And no, we're not talking about a new interpretation of the Honor Code and the discipline that goes with it or a fresh application of some other peculiar policy that sets the school apart. Nothing to do with metaphorical musket fire or the like.\n\nWe're talking basketball here. The ingredients for a level of hoop, a potential level, that BYU has never touched, not in the last 50 years, a span during which the Cougars have been the model of good, almost always good, and rarely great.\n\nWhy haven't they been great? Because they haven't been able to lure in enough top players, plain and simple. There have been a few sprinkled in through the years. Not enough of them. Danny Ainge was pretty darn good back around 1980. Jimmer Fredette surprised the college basketball world with his deep shooting a decade or so ago. Most of the others have been fine athletes dressed out as Boy Scouts, nice kids who might do good deeds, like help Grandma get safely to her parked car down the street, but they've never been quite talented enough to, say, win the West Coast Conference or, other than Ainge's team's run to the Elite Eight in '81, threaten to blow the lid off of college basketball.\n\nMaybe BYU never will.\n\nBut what's occurring in the basketball offices on the Provo campus now is enough to make you wonder. And nobody, as mentioned, has shifted their imaginations upward to wonder much about Cougar basketball in the past.\n\nMore than a few are shifting at present.\n\nIt started with Kevin Young's hiring a couple of months back, when the highly-regarded Phoenix Suns assistant was rather surprisingly drawn in to replace outgoing coach Mark Pope. Most thought it was much more likely that Young would end up mentoring an NBA team rather than BYU's.\n\nThe only way the Cougars could have pulled in a coach of that caliber was if he had been given ironclad guarantees that he would have afforded to him the support -- read: assets -- necessary not just to do the BYU thing of years gone by, not just to fiddle-faddle around with decent degrees of competitive achievement, rather to knock some premier heads around on the courts of Big 12 schools, a collection of teams that many agree is the best basketball league among college conferences.\n\nBYU introduces men's basketball coach Kevin Young during a news conference Wednesday, April 17, 2024, in Provo, Utah. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nYou've read and heard about bits and pieces of what's transpired since Young's arrival. Put them all together, though, and a force is rising at BYU that will be a problem for all kinds of opponents moving forward. A serious problem.\n\nThe talent is rolling in.\n\nThe headliner is Egor Demin, one of the highest-rated recruits BYU has ever signed. The projected lottery pick in the 2025 NBA draft from Spanish club Real Madrid, officially signed with BYU on Monday.\n\nYoung's response?\n\n\"We are thrilled that Egor and his family are joining us at BYU.\"\n\nYa think?\n\n\"He is a special talent with an extremely bright future.\"\n\nThat's what everyone is saying, and for good reason. Russian dude, at 6-9, can pass, shoot, and make plays. There are two reasons he's coming to BYU. One is he believes Young can prepare him for the NBA. Young himself put it this way: \"Egor has proven himself among the best prospects in Europe in recent years. We look forward to helping him grow on and off the court.\"\n\nMostly on it.\n\nSecond, Demin is getting paid. Nobody on the outside knows the exact figure, but estimates have placed the number at over $1 million. He's a one-and-done prospect who will depend on Young teaching him what he needs to know. In turn, Young hopes Demin will help him win -- right away.\n\nBut that's only a portion of the promising package.\n\nKanon Catchings, a top 40 recruit in the 2024 class who initially committed to Purdue, announced his commitment to BYU on Tuesday. If the name Catchings sounds familiar, it's because it is. Kanon is the nephew of Tamika Catchings, the WNBA star who won championships, an MVP award, pockets full of Olympic gold medals, and all kinds of professional respect. Kanon is a 6-8 forward who is thought to be an embryonic star.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nBrody Kozlowski, the skilled 6-8 forward who signed with USC out of Corner Canyon High School, in part because he and Mark Pope were not going to make a happy mix, dialed in at BYU after Young came aboard and the Trojans had a head coaching change.\n\nElijah Crawford, a pure point guard who was a Stanford recruit, shifted away from the Cardinal and straight to the Cougars. He came over with former Stanford assistant Brandon Dunson and this was a big get for BYU. He's a 3- or 4-star prospect, depending on which evaluator you subscribe to. Either way, the Cougars are fortunate to have him.\n\nAnd more.\n\nMawot Mag, a big-bodied Australian transfer, one of the better defenders in the Big Ten last season at Rutgers, will give BYU something that every college team needs. \"He's probably the best college defender I've seen in a long, long time,\" Maryland basketball coach Kevin Willard said last year.\n\nSyracuse forward Alan Griffin (0) drives to the basket against Rutgers forward Mawot Mag (3) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Piscataway, N.J., Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020. (AP Photo/Noah K. Murray)\n\nThere have been other additions, too, such as former Utah big man Keba Keita. And it came and went with substantial notice that the projected No. 1 pick in the NBA draft in two years, AJ Dybantsa, a kid who will play at Utah Prep in Hurricane, recently stopped by for an unofficial visit at BYU. Another BYU target is Dybantsa's teammate, JJ Mandaquit, a 4-star guard who holds offers from a bunch of schools.\n\nWith Catchings on the roster, the Cougars have now captured four top 100 recruits in this coming class.\n\nLet's reiterate it all simple and clear. BYU does not do that. It hasn't done that -- until now.\n\nIt gets Boy Scouts who look like they stumbled into the gym on their way to a troop meeting.\n\nThat's not this.\n\nThis is authentic ballers who have a laser-focus on ascending to the game's highest reaches, and they figure Kevin Young is a coach -- and BYU is a place -- that can boost them in getting there. With NIL cash available for their efforts. Young's got to be telling them he and BYU will do that, and give them every chance to get them where they want to go, if they're conscientious enough to listen and learn.\n\nMoreover, BYU found a way to hang onto two significant players already in the fold, players many around the Cougar program thought would be lost to other suitors, after this past season -- Dallin Hall and Richie Saunders. Both, it turns out, will be back.\n\nOne prize BYU did lose is Collin Chandler, a top recruit out of Farmington High School who was headed to BYU before his church mission and now is going to Kentucky with Pope.\n\nThe unanswered question that hovers still is this: Can Young actually coach? It's fairly obvious he can coach, and that's why many of the Suns players love the guy. The more accurate question is: Can he lead a college program -- this particular program -- to the mountaintop? Most forthright coaches admit that recruiting is the key to success in the college game, and Young appears able to persuade players that he's the man. So, they're starting to come. That's No. 1. But, meantime, a coach must also retain players, shaping them into a mature, cohesive group that is willing to work and sacrifice for one another in the way winning requires.\n\nIt's crazy stuff, indeed, and unexpected stuff, but BYU is now leaning hard on the first objective. The second one, we'll believe when it manifests itself, in its newfound form, plainly for everyone to see.\n\nEditor's note * This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

Purdue has also seen positive results on the QS World University and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.\n\nLafayette's new Columbian Park playground opens up\n\nThe newly renovated Columbian Park playground in Lafayette is now open following a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Children flocked updated playground, which features new towers, slides, shade sails, and a padded turf hill with additional slides. Renovations began in February as part of a broader effort to enhance Columbian Park, according to Mayor Tony Roswarski, who emphasized the city's commitment to improving parks and recreational opportunities for residents.\n\nFormer Purdue recruit commits to BYU\n\nTop-40 basketball recruit Kanon Catchings signed with BYU Tuesday, nearly two weeks since he asked to be released from his letter of intent to sign with the Boilermakers.\n\n\"My family and I met with (BYU) coach (Kevin) Young and the coaching staff last week and we immediately clicked,\" Catchings told ESPN. \"I knew right away this was the best fit for me.\" Young took over the reins after Mark Pope left for Kentucky in April. Catchings has strong basketball bloodlines as the nephew of WNBA Hall of Famer Tamika Catchings.\n\nA 6-foot-8, 185-pound small forward, Catchings averaged 15.3 points and 6.2 rebounds per game last season with Overtime Elite in Atlanta. Current BYU assistant Tim Fanning coached him at Overtime Elite and helped recruit him for the Cougars.", "source": {"uri": "purdueexponent.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Purdue Exponent"},

In the week following the departure of Mark Pope to Kentucky, the future looked anything but bright in Provo. Then BYU made a splashy hire in Kevin Young - the NBA's highest paid assistant coach and someone who was in line to be an NBA head coach. Young quickly got work filling out both the roster and his staff. Now, his staff is full and there is only one scholarship remaining.\n\nWhile it's still premature to call BYU a basketball school, it's hard to imagine a better start for Kevin Young as the BYU basketball coach.\n\nYoung's first hires were pivotal. Brandon Dunson and Chris Burgess filled the limited gap in Young's coaching resume - they were proven recruiters with years of power conference experience. Dunson was one of the best recruiters in college basketball at Stanford, and Burgess has been one of the top in-state recruiters over the last five years.\n\nThe Chris Burgess hire was especially impressive considering he was a candidate to be the head coach. Most BYU fans would have been happy with as the head coach, but getting him as an assistant coach is a home run. It was Burgess that gave BYU an edge in the recruitment of Keba Keita. More on Keita in a moment.\n\nWith only two staff members, Young got to work filling out his roster. Perhaps most importantly, he got Dallin Hall and Richie Saunders to come back. There was no shortage of potential suitors for both Hall and Saunders. Hall and Saunders believed in Kevin Young's vision for them and the program, and they opted to finish their college careers in Provo. Now, BYU will be able to bring them back and capitalize on the two best years of their college careers. BYU saw firsthand the benefits of roster continuity last season. Returning a roster core gave BYU a base they could go out and build around instead of starting from scratch.\n\nThe first commitment from the recruiting trail was Corner Canyon four-star standout Brody Kozlowski. In any other recruiting class, Kozlowski would have probably been the highest-rated commit. Kozlowski is ranked 94th in the ESPN top 100. According to the 247Sports composite rankings, he was the fourth-best recruit to ever sign with BYU and the best since the Cougars signed Eric Mika, TJ Haws, and Nick Emery.\n\nThen BYU moved quickly when Keba Keita hit the transfer portal. Keita, an experienced big from the University of Utah, fit the description that Kevin Young was looking for: a rim-running big that could create gravity in the paint on offense and defend the rim on defense.\n\nThat wasn't the only player that came to BYU through a connection to the new staff. Elijah Crawford, a Stanford signee, was released from his Stanford NLI and committed to the Cougars a few days later. Crawford was a four-star prospect in his own right with offers from around the country. Crawford was ranked the seventh-best recruit to ever sign with BYU. He would have ranked sixth if not for the signing of Brody Kozlowski a few days prior.\n\nAll of those signings would have made for a fantastic recruiting class and something that BYU could have built around in the future. But Young didn't stop there.\n\nEgor Demin, likely the highest-rated recruit in BYU history once he gets his official rating, committed to BYU. Demin is the kind of talent that BYU has rarely been able to get into the program as a freshman - he is a projected top 10 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Young was bold about his desire to make BYU a pipeline to the NBA, something that seemed like a pipe dream at the time. The Demin signing suddenly made that aspiration a legitimate possibility.\n\nThen BYU filled out the rest of the staff with three hires that brought years of experience to BYU. Will Voigt was a G League head coach last year before coming to BYU. Tim Fanning and John Linehan had years of experience at various levels of basketball. On paper, this is the best staff top to bottom in BYU history.\n\nWith a full staff, Young got back to filling out the roster. Rutgers transfer Mawot Mag was brought in to bolster the defense and provide something that a young BYU roster suddenly lacked: experience.\n\nThen Kanon Catchings picked BYU as the cherry on top of all the offseason acquisitions. Catchings was recently projected to be a first-round pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. He is the highest-rated signee in BYU history (until Egor Demin gets his rating), surpassing Eric Mika. Catchings' combination of size (6'9) and skill is a luxury that BYU basketball has never really had.\n\nIn two months, Kevin Young has reached recruiting heights that BYU didn't dream of over the last two decades.\n\nTransfer target Chaz Lanier and returned missionary Collin Chandler were arguably the only misses. However, BYU's recruiting efforts have more than made up for those. It's also worth noting that Chandler made his decision before even meeting Kevin Young. Lanier, a Tennessee native, returned home to play for the Volunteers.\n\nNow that the offseason is coming to a close, the wins must follow come November. Expectations will be high - something BYU didn't have to deal with last year.\n\nOne thing is clear - BYU fans are excited about the basketball program. Google searches about BYU basketball are up 550% vs the same time last year. In the words of Jon Rothstein, the buzz is palpable in Provo.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Young_(hurdler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Young (hurdler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brigham Young University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Burgess", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Burgess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provo, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Provo, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYU Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Mika", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Mika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Letter_of_Intent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Letter of Intent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Utah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Utah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lanier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Lanier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_Scarlet_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers Scarlet Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8256,h_4644,x_0,y_820/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cougs_daily/01j0rj5jgk3pc1rmts79.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662504", "eventUri": "eng-9662504", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

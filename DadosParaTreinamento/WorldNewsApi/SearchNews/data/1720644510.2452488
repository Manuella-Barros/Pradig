{"id": 231250384, "title": "Under a drone-filled sky, Ukraine tries to retake a town, one house at a time", "text": "The two Russian soldiers jogged across an apocalyptic landscape. They kept going, zigzagging over a vegetable patch. At the intersection between Hoholia and Travnia streets, the pair disappeared into a roofless brick building. Around them was the ruined town of Vovchansk. It was a smouldering hell of blackened blocks of flats and shell-dinted cottages. Vovchansk, once home to about 17,000 people, is approximately three miles (5km) from the border with Russia in north-east Ukraine. Russian troops seized it on the first day of Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale February 2022 invasion. They retreated six months later, going back up the road to the Russian city of Belgorod. A month ago \u2013 on 10 May \u2013 they swept in again, taking over Vovchansk\u2019s polyclinic and meat processing factory. A brutal battle has raged ever since. Russian forces control the north of the city and a grid of shattered western districts. Ukrainian troops hold the centre. Their fiefdom includes half of Korelenka Street, with the Russians concealed in nearby basements. Fighting takes place house by house. Vovchansk now resembles a 21st-century mini Stalingrad, a place of death, rattling gunfire and close-quarters combat. Everything is seen. \u201cThe sky is thick with drones. Our drones, their drones,\u201d said Sasha, a 34-year-old lieutenant with Ukraine\u2019s 57th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade, while sitting in his HQ, located beyond the city. Neither side was able to use armoured vehicles inside Vovchansk because of kamikaze attacks. He said: \u201cAt the start, Russia sent in tanks. We destroyed them all in five minutes. If artillery doesn\u2019t get you, drones will.\u201d Instead, small groups of infantry go in on foot. It is a perilous journey, through a wood and across the Vovcha river. Evacuating casualties was very difficult, Sasha said. The Ukrainian military uses heavy-lift Vampire drones to airdrop supplies to forward posts: water, food, bullets. Clearing abandoned buildings was dangerous, with the enemy waiting in ambush, or just 200 metres away. \u201cYou never know when someone will open fire,\u201d he said. A bank of screens showed a live video feed of the city. The two Russians seen jogging earlier were inside their brown cottage. A closeup of the central market \u2013 located in a grey zone - presented a gruesome scene. The corpses of six Russian soldiers lay on the ground. \u201cI feel no pity for them. They are constantly trying to take our territory. Russians are zombified people. If we don\u2019t halt them, they will continue,\u201d Sasha said. A veteran of the grinding battle for Bakhmut \u2013 won by Russia in May 2023 \u2013 Sasha said Moscow was guilty of genocide. Wagner mercenaries went into a cellar and murdered a Ukrainian family, including children. \u201cThey shot everybody,\u201d he said. Street battles in Vovchansk were so intense that only experienced Ukrainian soldiers were deployed there, rotating among themselves in shifts. The Russians were a mixture of professionals and novices, he added. The 57th scrambled to Vovchansk last month. The brigade\u2019s commander, Maj Yuriy, said his men had pushed the Russians back and stabilised the situation. \u201cA couple of days ago we stopped their advance here. Our task is to hold our positions and to inflict maximum losses. And then to gradually move forward,\u201d he said. The Russians would typically attack about 7pm or 8pm, creeping forward as dusk fell. Ukraine\u2019s biggest challenge is Russian air power. Earlier last week, enemy combat planes dropped 36 guided bombs known as KABs in a 24 hour-period. Strikes were more frequent near the occupied eastern city of Avdiivka, Sasha said. \u201cIf we had air defences to shoot down Russian bombers, the situation would have changed a long time ago. We wouldn\u2019t be defending. We would be attacking,\u201d he pointed out. As well as Vovchansk, Russia has advanced towards the village of Lyptsi. Its two-pronged incursion piles pressure on Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, almost 19 miles away. The Kremlin\u2019s goal is to bring its big guns to within shelling range of Kharkiv in order to inflict daily misery on its 1 million-strong population \u2013 a repeat of 2022. An additional objective is to capture a road connecting Vovchansk to the city of Kupiansk, where Russian troops are closing in. The latest Vovchansk offensive has forced Kyiv to divert forces from other parts of the frontline. Putin, though, might have miscalculated. With Kharkiv in peril, the Biden administration last month lifted its prohibition on the use of some US weapons inside Russian territory. European allies followed suit, but White House restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles \u2013 which may knock out Russian military aerodromes \u2013 remain. On Thursday, Joe Biden \u2013 attending D-day celebrations \u2013 reaffirmed US support for Ukraine and described Putin as a \u201ctyrant bent on domination.\u201d The US president, however, made clear that Kyiv could not strike Moscow or the Kremlin. It was allowed to attack \u201cjust across the border where they\u2019re receiving significant fire from conventional weapons used by the Russians to go into Ukraine to kill Ukrainians\u201d, Biden said. Still, this local change helps. Previously, Russia amassed soldiers between about nine and 19 miles away from the Vovchansk district, beyond the range of Ukrainian drones. Ihor, a volunteer with the Barracuda drone surveillance group, said the invaders parked their armoured vehicles in an old Soviet collective farm and used the Russian town of Shebekino as a staging post. \u201cTheir logistics are now more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new rule might be a gamechanger.\u201d On 1 June or the following day, Kyiv used a US-supplied Himars rocket system to destroy a Russian S-300/400 missile complex close to Belgorod. Images showed two wrecked launchers and a damaged command post. Sasha said he would only call in a Himars strike if he could be certain to kill \u201c20-30\u201d Russians. \u201cAmerican rockets are expensive,\u201d he added. More US weapons were arriving after Congress in April passed a $61bn military aid package, he said. When the battle for Vovchansk began, thousands of residents fled the city. Some exited in private cars, others went on evacuation buses. A few left it too late. Oleksandr Humaniuk, founder of the Rose in Hand charity, said he received desperate phone calls from 10 families living in basements in Russian-occupied streets. Rescue was impossible. A disabled man called him and said he wanted to get out but could only walk 50 metres. \u201cWe also have calls from people where it\u2019s a trap. A few locals support the Russians. They try and lure police in so the Russians shoot them,\u201d Humaniuk said. He said Russian soldiers kidnapped an unknown number of civilians, using them as a human shields and taking them across the border. They murdered others. Bodies lay in the streets. A man in a wheelchair was killed outside his house. Two volunteers and a policeman died trying to help civilians, he said. Villagers living in the nearby countryside have also escaped. Oleksandr Lubianko said he was the last person to leave his hamlet home in Yuchenkove, west of Vovchansk. \u201cWe have no power, no water,\u201d he said. He said he packed a single suitcase and set off across the fields, eventually coming across a Ukrainian soldier. Lubianko had been feeding his neighbours\u2019 goats, chickens and ducks. \u201cI was sad to abandon them. Who knows if they will survive. The goat looked at me reproachfully,\u201d he said. His sister Nataliia Hrybenkova left the nearby village of Bilyi Kolodayaz. She described Russia\u2019s occupation two years ago as \u201cbearable\u201d. \u201cMasked gunmen came round and stole my husband\u2019s Toyota car,\u201d she recalled. \u201cYou were not allowed to speak Ukrainian. But if you kept your head down, it was OK.\u201d Russia\u2019s latest bloody attack was much worse. \u201cThere is bombing all the time. There are airstrikes every day,\u201d she said, adding that the kindergarten and mill were flattened. Before the war, Vovchansk was a prosperous city. It had several big factories and a thriving agricultural sector. There were close ties with relatives and other Russians living in Belgorod. \u201cNow we are enemies. So many people have suffered, so many lives have been lost,\u201d Hrybenkova said, speaking at a reception centre in Kharkiv for displaced and homeless people. \u201cWe became bums, almost. These are borrowed clothes,\u201d she added wryly. Valentina \u2013 who declined to give her surname \u2013 said she got out of Vovchansk in a car with her husband, daughter Anya and six-year-old grandson. They hid for several hours, before fleeing under gunfire. \u201cWe saw planes and heard bombs. We crossed ourselves and hoped for the best,\u201d she said. She previously worked in the city\u2019s aggregate factory, which manufactured parts for helicopters and Kamaz lorries. \u201cI did the detailing,\u201d she explained. Her daughter, a nurse, helped evacuate patients from the hospital. \u201cWe got everybody out in time,\u201d Anya said. Soon afterwards, Russian soldiers stormed the building and set up on observation point in a medical department with a tower across the road. What would happen now? \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Valentina said. \u201cAll I can tell you is the Russians thought it would be easy to take Vovchansk. They were wrong. Ukraine is fighting back.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Hardened Ukrainian veterans hope new supplies of US rockets will help push Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces back</p><p>The two Russian soldiers jogged across an apocalyptic landscape.

Euromillions lottery winner Colin Weir and his wife Christine scooped a massive \u00a3161 million in 2011. The couple took just 10 minutes to snap up his lavish \u00a33.5m mansion near Troon, the Mirror reports. But following their big win the pair parted ways. Colin died in December 2019 from from sepsis and an acute kidney injury, aged 71. The couple divorced just before he died but the former TV cameraman signed over sole ownership of the plush Frognal House to Christine. Mr Weir was spending \u00a3100,000 a week, according to new documents. He splashed out on luxury cars and pumped money into his favourite football club, Partick Thistle. By the time he died, Mr Weir had spent \u00a340million in just eight years. One financial expert said: \u201cSpending \u00a340million in eight years takes a bit of doing.\u201d His garage housed four luxury cars \u2013 a vintage Bentley Arnage, worth \u00a310,000, a \u00a328,250 three-year-old Jaguar F-Pace SUV, a \u00a324,000 four-year-old Mercedes Benz E Class Estate and a 2019 Mercedes Benz V Class people carrier, valued at about \u00a335,000. He bought a 55 per cent stake in Partick Thistle a month before he died so he could donate the club to the fans and put its future in the hands of the local community. He also shared his fortune with friends and charitable trusts, and passed on money to his two children with Christine \u2013 Carly, 32, and Jamie, 30. Before his huge jackpot win, Mr Weir had worked as a cameraman at STV. His ex-wife Christine previously worked as a psychiatric nurse. At the time of his death, he lived in a \u00a31.1million five-bedroom seafront home in Ayr, which he bought in June 2018 after his marriage split. Papers show his council tax was \u00a337.08 in credit and he had the maximum \u00a350,000 in National Savings and Investments Premium Bonds.

MORE: Trump, Now A Felon, Earns His Stripes As The Grand Dragon Of Political Racism Just days before the 2016 presidential election \u2013 and days after then-FBI Director James Comey announced the reopening of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified documents on her private email server \u2013 Trump fearmongered during one of his infamous rallies about the prospects of the Democratic nominee winning that year\u2019s presidential election. Trump \u2013 who was earlier this year found guilty of fraud and still faces two more criminal cases \u2013 suggested that Clinton could end up under federal criminal indictment and said the prospects of having a president under such legal scrutiny, including a possible \u201ccriminal trial,\u201d would have a devastating effect on the United States, particularly governmentally. \u201cIf she were to win this election, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. In that situation, we could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial,\u201d Trump said to groans from the audience. \u201cIt would grind government to a halt. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run.\u201d Fast-forward nearly eight years and Trump\u2019s words can and could be used against him amid demands for him to end his presidential campaign as he faces sentencing next month following the hush money verdict. Trump has announced that \u201cthe real verdict\u201d will be on Election Day when voters decide who the next president will be, but the NAACP has a completely different proposition \u2013 for him to drop out of the race altogether. To be sure, nothing in the U.S. Constitution prevents a convicted felon from running for president, something with which the NAACP found some racial irony. Calling Trump\u2019s conviction \u201ca monumental step toward justice for the American people,\u201d NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said the verdict reinforced one truth, in particular: \u201cDonald Trump is unfit to represent American democracy.\u201d Suggesting that Trump remains in the race is a prospect that flirts with white privilege if not all-out white supremacy, Johnson suggested. \u201cThe NAACP strongly believes that anyone who has been found guilty of criminal offenses of this magnitude is unfit to occupy the Oval Office,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cAs Black Americans have been denied basic human rights due to less offensive crimes, any attempt to advance Donald Trump\u2019s nomination for Presidency would be a gross advancement of white supremacist policy.\u201d Johnson is correct in that there is an element of racial hypocrisy considering how an untold number of Black people have been disqualified from holding certain positions of employment because of their criminal backgrounds. His question is clear: Why should Trump be held to a different standard, especially when the position in question is the American presidency, the most powerful post in the world? And now, with the resurfacing of Trump\u2019s 2016 comments condemning the thought of a presidential candidate under felony indictment still being allowed to run for the highest public office in the nation, that above question can now be asked of himself. Though it\u2019s unlikely Trump will drop out of the race, his criminal conviction could still affect his standing within the Republican Party, which is set to hold its national convention just days after Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing on July 11. It is at the Republican National Convention where the Party\u2019s presidential nomination takes place in a process that determines who will represent that GOP on the presidential ballot. The Biden Campaign, for its part, is preparing as if Trump will still be in the race. \u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box,\u201d Biden Campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement following Thursday\u2019s verdict. \u201cConvicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\u201d SEE ALSO: \u2018Hallelujah!!!\u2019 Maxine Waters Rejoices That Trump Was Convicted In Hush Money Trial Donald Trump\u2019s Appeal Of Hush Money Verdict May Be Decided By Court Of Black Women Judges Trump Surrenders In Manhattan, Arraignment Brings The Protesters Out 34 photos", "summary": "<p>As Donald Trump stays in the presidential race, old video from 2016 shows he said White House candidates under indictment \u201cshouldn\u2019t be allowed to run.\u201d</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://newsone.com/5275639/old-trump-indicted-candidates-video/\">Old Video Resurfaces Of Trump Saying Presidential Candidates Under Indictment \u2018Shouldn\u2019t Be Allowed To Run\u2019</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://newsone.com\">NewsOne</a>.</p>", "url": "https://newsone.com/5275639/old-trump-indicted-candidates-video/", "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/06/17173273136783.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&crop=0,0,100,683px", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:53", "author": "Editor at NewsOne", "authors": ["Editor at NewsOne"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.233}

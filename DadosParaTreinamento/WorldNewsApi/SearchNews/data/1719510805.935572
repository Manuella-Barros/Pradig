All About Dianne, Deloris, Anita and Danielle", "text": "Viola Davis and her siblings had a tough childhood, but they\u2019re writing their own happy endings. Born on Aug. 11, 1965, Viola is the fifth of six children born to Mae Alice Davis and Dan Davis. The couple, who wed as teenagers, welcomed their first child and only son, John Henry Davis, when Mae was just 15 years old. He was followed by Viola\u2019s sisters Dianne Davis Wright, Deloris Davis Grant and Anita Davis. \u201c[My mother] had my sister Dianne when she was eighteen, Anita at nineteen, Deloris at twenty and me at twenty-two,\u201d Viola wrote in her 2022 memoir, Finding Me. The pair\u2019s youngest daughter, Danielle Eugina Davis, was born 12 years after Viola on April 21, 1977. Though the Davis children experienced what Viola called \u201chappy memories\u201d of growing up on Sunday TODAY in 2019, their childhood was also filled with what she called \u201cthe darkness.\u201d The siblings\u2019 early years were marred by extreme poverty and sexual abuse. They were also witness to violence, with Dan physically abusing Mae. (Dan died from pancreatic cancer in 2006, though Viola told PEOPLE he made peace with Mae before his death.) The sisters turned to each other for strength. Viola wrote in her memoir: \u201cWe all needed one another. None of us could fight individually.\u201d And together, they persevered. \u201cMe, my sister Deloris, my sister Dianne, a lot of my family members have broken generational curses because we dared to dream big,\u201d the actress told Ancestry in 2023. \u201cWe dared to just dig in deep in the dirt and filth and trauma of our childhood and want better for our lives.\u201d Keep reading to find out more about Viola Davis' sisters Dianne, Deloris, Anita and Danielle and their relationships with each other. They were born in South Carolina but raised in Rhode Island Viola opened up about her origins to Ancestry in 2023. \u201cI came from Singleton Plantation in St. Matthews, S.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cI was born in my grandmother\u2019s sharecropper\u2019s house.\u201d Though the family moved to Central Falls, R.I. when Viola was an infant, the family struggled financially. According to The Providence Journal, Mae worked as a maid while Dan was a horse groomer. \u201cWe lived in condemned buildings \u2014 apartments infested with rats,\u201d Viola told Sunday TODAY in 2019. They also struggled to fit into the Central Falls community they grew up in. As Deloris explained to Ancestry in 2023, \u201cViola and I and my sisters, we all struggled, because we were growing up in a community where there were no African Americans.\u201d Anita stood up to Viola\u2019s bullies Anita had Viola\u2019s back when it came to neighborhood bullies. The How to Get Away with Murder actress recounted her reliance on her big sister for protection in her 2022 memoir, Finding Me. \u201cIf the situation was especially sticky, as backup I would call upon my big sister Anita,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe instilled fear in every boy, girl, woman, man and dog in Central Falls, Rhode Island.\u201d According to the Oscar winner, Anita even \u201cgrew her nails to be a better fighter.\u201d Viola shared Anita\u2019s secret for \u201cterrifying\u201d her sister\u2019s tormentors in a 2016 interview with Stephen Colbert, explaining, \u201cShe had this whole method where she would growl and drool.\" She added, \u201cIt really was very effective. I recommend it. ... Just drool with a little brick in your hand.\u201d Deloris encouraged Viola to act Viola revealed in a 2023 interview with Ancestry that she almost gave up on her dreams of becoming an actor at one point. According to the producer, she decided to pursue a career as a teacher in an effort to earn a more steady income. \u201cI took a bunch of English courses and I was more depressed than I\u2019d ever been in my life,\u201d she said. Her trajectory was altered by her older sister, who encouraged her to follow her heart and do what she loved. \u201cIt only changed when my sister Deloris said, \u2018Viola, you said you always wanted to be an actor,\u2019 \u201d the actress recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018How am I gonna be an actor?\u2019 She was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know! I just know that you loved it. So, do it!' \u201d Viola added: \u201cAs soon as I did that, the depression lifted.\u201d Deloris explained the rationale behind her guidance, saying, \u201cViola was never happy unless she was acting. What other advice would I have given her?\u201d Dianne went to Harvard Dianne made a commitment to learning after being held back in the first grade. \u201cAt that moment, I became serious about education,\u201d she said while accepting a TRIO Family Achievement Award from the Council for Opportunity in Education in September 2018. The former U.S. Department of Agriculture employee, who worked as a civil servant for the unit\u2019s civil rights division for 40 years before her retirement, said that she shared her newfound love of knowledge with her siblings. \u201cEverything I learned at school, I brought it home for my sisters,\u201d she said, joking, \u201cI was the only one who could be the teacher or the principal.\u201d As Dianne told the audience, her pursuit of learning ultimately led to her acceptance to an Ivy League school. She spent two years at Rhode Island College before transferring to Harvard University. Danielle has a large family Viola\u2019s younger sister, Danielle, is the most private of her siblings. While not much is known about her, Viola revealed in a 2015 speech that Danielle is the mother of at least six children. Davis also wished her baby sister a happy birthday on social media in 2023, writing, \u201cI remember it like it was yesterday. You burst all of our hearts, lives wide open. Danielle.....YOU are the love of your life.....YOU are your gift! Love you my Nelly! Have the very best day.\u201d The sisters received an award for their educational pursuits On Sept. 15, 2018, Dianne, Deloris, Anita, Viola and their mother Mae received the Council for Opportunity in Education\u2019s first TRIO Family Award. This distinction honors the success of families who have participated in federal programs aimed at supporting achievement in higher education, such as Upward Bound and Student Support Services. Maureen Hoyler, president and CEO of the Council, gave a statement about the decision, saying, \u201cThe success of the Davis sisters is a prime example of why federal support for education is an investment that strengthens families and communities. When one sibling enrolls in a program like Upward Bound and goes onto college, frequently younger brothers and sisters, and even parents, follow.\u201d Deloris teaches drama Viola isn\u2019t the only one with ties to acting in the Davis family. Her older sister Deloris, who won a skit contest with Viola as a child, grew up to become a drama and advanced English teacher. According to The Providence Journal, Deloris received her Ph.D. in education from Rhode Island College before returning to Central Falls High School as an educator. \u201cI like returning here every day,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI know the families. I get a sense of kinship with the community.\u201d She added: \u201cI see myself in these children.\u201d Deloris previously opened up about the impact her little sister had on her classes in a 2012 interview with The Rhode Show. \u201cShe is the biggest inspiration for our students,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cEspecially the students I have in my drama class, because they\u2019re up on the stage where Viola Davis stood, where Viola Davis acted.\u201d As of 2022, Deloris had been with the school for 25 years. Anita has multiple sclerosis According to Diverse magazine, Anita returned to Rhode Island Community College several decades after being unenrolled. She faced a unique set of challenges as a student: In addition to being the oldest person in her classes, she also has multiple sclerosis. Viola bonded with Dianne and Deloris over a shared medical diagnosis Viola told PEOPLE in 2019 that a 2016 prediagnosis of diabetes brought her closer to Dianne and Deloris, both of whom have Type 2 diabetes. \u201cIt hit home for me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy two sisters have Type 2 Diabetes, my great aunt had Type 2 Diabetes. (She) lost both of her legs and was in a wheelchair for decades, up until she finally succumbed to the disease. As did my grandmother on my father\u2019s side.\u201d According to the performer, her family\u2019s experiences with the disease inspired her to narrate the 2019 documentary A Touch of Sugar, which confronts America\u2019s diabetes crisis. \u201c[Diabetes] has affected [my sisters] in different ways, in terms of the symptoms they\u2019ve had,\u201d Viola said. \u201cBut the thing that\u2019s even more important is that they\u2019re managing it. They have tackled it. They\u2019re not just watching it and sitting by.\u201d Deloris has traveled to more than 80 countries While accepting her TRIO Family Achievement Award in September 2018, Deloris revealed that she is a world traveler. \u201cI wanted to be an archaeologist almost all of my life ... because I wanted to travel,\u201d she said. According to the teacher, her time working with TRIO\u2019s federally funded Upward Bound program, which helps to prepare participants for college entry, furthered her desire to see the world, as it exposed her to people of many different backgrounds and cultures. \u201cWhen I was in Upward Bound, I met so many people from around the world, Cambodia, Laos, China, from South America and I loved hearing their stories,\u201d she said. As a result, Deloris began to visit their lands. She shared: \u201cThose stories inspired me to travel to probably more than 80 countries \u2014 at least I stopped counting after 80.\u201d", "summary": "Viola Davis has four sisters and one brother", "url": "https://people.com/all-about-viola-davis-sisters-8609832", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/XGCKnn9_E-MtrLDxEJnUp1NS72c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(971x420:973x422)/viola-davis-sisters-1-f4a32199b73b4882a18b52d399771c3b.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:00", "author": "Nicole Briese", "authors": ["Nicole Briese"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.281}

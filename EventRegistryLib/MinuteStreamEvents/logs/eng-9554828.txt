Something she was willing to literally fight for: \"My mom's picture was in my wallet. And my mom passed away eight years ago.\"\n\nThen things got quite a bit more complicated.\n\nAmid her intense search, Vargas hit a vehicle near NW 2nd Avenue and 22nd Lane in the Miami neighborhood of Wynwood, WTVJ said.\n\nSurveillance video caught the moment the two cars collided; Vargas was driving the dark-colored car.\n\nIt's quite likely that Vargas spotted the crook around the time of the crash, because video shows her quickly exiting her totaled car and confronting the crook on a sidewalk right there at the intersection.\n\n\"I tried to force and grab my wallet, and he didn't want to let go of it,\" she explained to WFOR. \"So ... he put his hand behind [him], and I thought he was gonna pull out a gun or a knife. So, that's when I started punching him -- because it was either me or him.\"\n\n\"He was yelling that it wasn't my bag and that I was crazy,\" she added to WFOR.\n\nPolice soon arrested the suspect, identified as 41-year-old Luis Machado, WTVJ said, adding that he got himself a black eye for his troubles.\n\nA police report indicates Machado admitted that the wallet wasn't his but denied breaking into Vargas' vehicle, WFOR said.\n\n\"He admitted to having some of the victim's property, but then he claims he didn't know how the property became in his possession, which obviously were conflicting statements that didn't make sense,\" Kiara Delva with Miami police added to WFOR.\n\nThe arrest report states Machado is accused of smashing Vargas' car window while she was at work and stealing a bag and wallet from her, WFOR noted, adding that he was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and petty theft.\n\nThe car belonging to the other driver was totaled in the crash, too, WFOR said. But no serious injuries were reported, WTVJ said, adding that Vargas was ticketed for the accident.\n\n\"I just want to say sorry to the person that I crashed into,\" Vargas told WTVJ. \"She gave me a hug. She was very nice. I just want to say sorry to her.\"\n\nVargas told investigators she was so focused on following the suspected thief that she crashed into an oncoming car, WTVJ added.\n\nVargas added to WTVJ that she wasn't concerned about money in her wallet -- instead there was something inside it that's irreplaceable. Something she was willing to literally fight for: \"My mom's picture was in my wallet. And my mom passed away eight years ago.\"\n\n\"So, that was sentimental value for me that I needed to recover,\" she added to WTVJ. \"That's why I did it.\"\n\nVargas also noted to WTVJ, \"I had so much adrenaline in me that I didn't think about the consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFOR-TV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WFOR-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVJ", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WTVJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynwood", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wynwood"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52211163&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C13%2C0%2C73", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554828", "eventUri": "eng-9554828", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-29", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 8}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Instead, he was forced to find a new route to the big leagues and signed with the Milwaukee Milkmen of the independent American Association.\n\nThe Milkmen were prepping for the start of their season in May and finally, Vargas got the call he had been waiting for. He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels on May 1 and was assigned to the Low-A Inland Empire 66ers. He has struggled, batting .111 with three hits and three RBIs in 27 at-bats.\n\nBaseball America's Matt Eddy highlighted Vargas among last year's minor league free agents to watch. He wrote that \"Vargas' raw power is apparent in his 114 mph max exit velocity and extreme damage on contact. The issue has been making enough contact to take full advantage. Vargas doesn't chase much out of the zone but can be beat in the zone with good stuff.\"\n\nThe left-handed hitter appeared in 456 minor league games across four levels.

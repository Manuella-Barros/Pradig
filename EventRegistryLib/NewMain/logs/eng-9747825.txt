But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year.\n\nWhile this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage.\n\nA dream of affordability\n\nCarranza 's Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift.

I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\" Carranza said.\n\nAs of April 1, California's minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort's employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024.\n\nBut in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough.\n\nAfter Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months' rent for an apartment.\n\nToday, she shares an apartment with a roommate.\n\nChange at the Disneyland Resort - and in affordability in Southern California in general - has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years.\n\nWhen she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there's utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn't travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog.\n\n\"It does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\" Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they've been doing around the park and telling them they've been brave to try the thrill rides.\n\nPalmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city's minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.\n\nDisneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years.

Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments.\n\nTogether, they represent about 40% of the entire resort's employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now.\n\nThe unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThese groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors' Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process.\n\nOfficially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist.\n\nSEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work.\n\nThe NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing.\n\nDisneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks' uniform policy and that only a \"handful\" of employees have been disciplined.\n\nDisneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests \"an uninterrupted, immersive experience,\" and that \"anything that distracts from the show or story, be it a non-approved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.\"\n\nThe term \"cast member\" refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance.

It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\" Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they've been doing around the park and telling them they've been brave to try the thrill rides.\n\nPalmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city's minimum wage laws.

Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.\n\nDisneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years.

Ms Carranza says she makes $20.65 an hour (about \u00a315.99) at the park but last summer, she couldn't afford rent in this Southern California city where the average apartment can run more than $2,000 (about \u00a31,550) a month.\n\nMs Carranza teared up as she recounted the struggles of that summer, including sneaking for showers in Disneyland's costume department. She now shares a small apartment with her boyfriend, who also works at the park, but still makes barely enough to make ends meet.\n\n\"That's not something that anybody should experience working a full-time job for a company like Disney,\" she told the BBC.\n\nMs Carranza, like others who work at the park, detailed to the BBC the financial hardships that come with working at what's supposed to be the \"Happiest Place on Earth\". About 10,000 union workers at Disneyland - the first of 12 parks created around the globe - are threatening to strike over the wages and what they say are retaliatory anti-union practices.\n\nHundreds of workers protested outside the park this week, with an array of signs and pins showing Mickey Mouse's gloved fist in defiance.\n\n\"Mickey would want fair pay,\" workers chanted outside Disneyland near the park's gates.\n\nThey are voting on Friday on whether to authorize a strike, days before union contract negotiations for workers are set to resume.\n\nA vote to authorise a strike does not mean a strike is imminent, but it could set workers up to act quickly if negotiations sour. Authorisation also gives the unions leverage as talks continue next week.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired 16 June, and the current negotiations involves a coalition of unions that represent nearly 10,000 employees at the park, which includes everyone from those who work as characters and operate rides to sales, restaurant, and janitorial workers.\n\nUnion officials say about one in 10 Disneyland cast members have experienced homelessness while working at the park. A survey of employees showed 73% say they don't make enough to cover basic expenses each month and about a third said they experienced housing insecurity within the last year.\n\n\"We're the ones who make the magic,\" says L Slaughter, a host at the Toontown-themed part of the park. \"We need Disney to pay us a liveable wage.\"\n\nMs Slaughter spent two years living in her car while working at the park. She now has a small apartment about an hour's drive from Disneyland.\n\nShe spent a lot of that time trying to find a safe parking spot to sleep, she says, adding that staff are not allowed to sleep in the Disneyland parking lots.\n\n\"My rent just went up $200 and I won't be able to make rent again,\" she says.\n\nMs Slaughter makes $19.90 an hour - thanks to a minimum wage mandate passed by city voters in 2018. Disney unsuccessfully fought the wage hike, but workers say it's still not enough to survive in Southern California.\n\nA living wage calculator built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, says a single person with no children would need to be paid $30.48 an hour to afford to live near Disneyland in Orange County, which is about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nWorkers who talked to the BBC said they have kept their jobs at the park because they love the Disney brand, and they rely on the generous healthcare benefits and union-operated food bank, which some workers described as a saving-grace.\n\nDisney says it is committed to negotiations with its \"cast members\" - the company's term for employees who play princesses and pirates as well as the chefs or janitors who maintain the park.\n\n\"We respect and value our cast members and recognize the important role they play in creating happiness for our guests,\" Disney said in a statement, adding that talks with the unions representing its workers will resume 22 July and they are committed to reaching a deal \"that focuses on what matters most to our current cast members, helps us attract new cast, and positions Disneyland Resort for growth and the creation of more jobs\".\n\nThe last Disneyland strike was in 1984, and it lasted 22 days.\n\nMs Carranza described the back-breaking work she does nightly at the park - cleaning, polishing, repairing floors and sometimes installing carpets.\n\nShe said last summer living in her car was the lowest point in her life, and she credits her dogs with keeping her alive.\n\n\"I know that they're the reason why I'm still here, why I didn't let go,\" she said. \"There were times when I questioned what I was doing here and how I was going to get back on my feet.\"\n\nBut even with the small studio apartment Ms Carranza now has, she says she's still living paycheck-to-paycheck and sometimes can only afford to eat rice or noodles.\n\nAlthough workers' demands are economic, the vote to strike was called in response to complaints that workers were disciplined for wearing the Mickey badges and distributing union information in the park.\n\nIn June, the unions filed unfair labour practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney for \"unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work.\"\n\nColleen Palmer, one of the negotiators from Local UFCW 324, has worked at Disneyland for nearly 37 years and makes almost $24 an hour as a \"merchandise hostess\". She says she wore her union badge for less than half an hour before management told her to take it off.\n\nPalmer says workers are responsible for the experience that customers enjoy at Disneyland, and that her loyalty and experience should be rewarded. She said workers believe the pay gap between the workers and the company's executives is outrageous: Disney CEO Bob Iger's compensation was $31.6 million in 2023 - hundreds of times the amount Disneyland cast members earn.\n\n\"It makes me wonder, why don't you want to recognize me? Because I'm making you that money, so that you can buy that sports team now,\" she said, referring to news that Mr Iger and his wife had taken over the LA women's soccer team, Angel City Football Club.\n\nThe disparity between workers pay and management has been fuelling labour unrest in the United States. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation rose 1,460 percent between 1978 and 2021.\n\nDisneyland is a unique workplace. Many consider it a career, not a job, and workers are often also fans of the Disney brand - some call it the cult of Disney.\n\nWorkers get perks like free admission to Disney parks for their family and friends. But they also say Disney is not flexible when they have a family crisis or get sick. Many have second and third jobs that Disneyland's unpredictable schedules make challenging to juggle.\n\nFor students and retirees working part-time, it can be a dream job, but it no longer provides a living wage for people in and around Anaheim, a wealthy city whose biggest employer is Disney, workers say.\n\n\"Without us, Disney would be like anywhere else,\" says Morgan, who lived in motels around Disneyland for four years with his children and wanted to be identified by his middle name only.\n\nThe breakup of Morgan's marriage caused him to lose his housing and cheap motels were all he could afford with his Disney wages. When his children were with their mother, he often slept outside and hid in shadows to avoid police or theft.\n\nHe now has a second full-time job as a recruiter - which he can do from home - and an apartment he can afford with the combined income.\n\nStill, he takes pride in his job selling Disney merchandise and says every cast member takes the job seriously.\n\n\"It's not the animatronics - it's us. At least respect us enough to pay us a decent wage.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It would be the first at the original Disney resort in 40 years.\n\nDisneyland officials said plans are in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike.\n\nUnion leaders said that if the strike does take place, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike the open-ended strikes by actors and writers unions that have shut down film and television production at Disney and other media and technology companies for much of 2023.\n\nStrike authorization votes are common and usually pass overwhelmingly. But that doesn't mean a strike will necessarily occur, as happened with the Teamsters at UPS last year.\n\nWhile this potential strike is ostensibly aimed at preventing Disney from wearing union badges on the job, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is the current contract, which many say does not provide a living wage.\n\nCarranza's hourly wage at Disneyland is just over $20, after factoring in a difference for working nights. Her work is arduous, often dragging 600 feet of PVC pipe and working with heavy machines to polish the floors.\n\nIt is disappointing that the balloons we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I earn an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of these Disney balloons, Carranza said.\n\nAs of April 1, the minimum wage for fast food workers in California has been $20 an hour, which has had repercussions for other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, California, home to the Disneyland Resort, had already declared the minimum wage for fast food workers to be $20 an hour. approved a measure which required station workers to earn a minimum wage of $19.90 starting in January 2024.\n\nAfter living in a car, Carranza moved into a hotel because she couldn't afford the deposit or first and last months' rent on an apartment.\n\nThe changes at Disneyland Resort and in Southern California affordability in general have been deeply troubling to Coleen Palmer, who has worked at Disneyland Resort for 37 years.\n\nAt first, Palmer says she could afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment for $400 a month on her monthly salary of about $650. Today, she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just over $2,000 a month and limits her grocery purchases to the $2,800 she brings in each month. There are also bills for electricity, food, phone, medical care and other fixed expenses. She doesn't travel outside of work to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that she can share with her dog.\n\nSometimes I feel very demoralized. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I wonder if it's worth it. Should I go somewhere else? But I'm a few years away from retirement, Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, mostly because she loves the job. She loves talking to the kids about what they do at the park and telling them they were brave enough to try the thrill rides.\n\nPalmer is happy to see lower-paid workers getting raises because of the city's minimum wage laws. But those who earn a little more, with decades of experience, haven't gotten a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.\n\nDisneyland officials said wages have increased more than 40 percent over the past five years. But much of that increase is due to changes to the minimum wage at the state and local levels.\n\nA strike would affect about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June.\n\nAnother 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work in the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, at Disney hotels or at the resort's other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contracts expire in September and they are not part of the current strikes.\n\nTogether, they represent about 40 percent of all employees at the resort. But only Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now.\n\nThe unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThese groups do not include character and parade performers who organized in May under the Actors Equity Association and have not yet begun their bargaining process.\n\nOfficially, the potential strike would be over union badges depicting a raised Mickey Mouse fist.\n\nIn June, SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney for what they say are hundreds of instances of illegal discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing the badges on the job.\n\nThe NLRB is expected to investigate the allegations in the coming months, after which an NLRB regional director could decide whether the case merits a hearing.\n\nDisneyland officials told CNN that wearing union badges went against the park's uniform policy and that only a handful of employees were disciplined.\n\nDisneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to provide guests with an uninterrupted and immersive experience, and that anything that distracts from the show or story, whether it's an unapproved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a supervisor.\n\nThe term cast member refers to any Disney employee, as the company considers every experience in front of a guest to be a performance. Each employee strives to create a space where guests escape reality and suspend their disbelief, to feel like they are actually on a Star Wars planet, for example.

If a strike does occur, it would be the first at Disneyland in 40 years.\n\nThe number of employees who voted was not released, but the unions said that of the members who participated, 99% voted to authorize a strike.\n\n\"This vote shows that the Cast Members have had enough!\" Aaron Zarate, a candy maker at Disneyland who is a member of the workers' bargaining committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe unions cited economic hardship for their members, including food and housing insecurity. They have been bargaining since April 24.\n\nDisneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good said that a strike authorization is \"not unusual\" during the bargaining process, and noted negotiations are still scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate the important roles our cast members play in creating memorable experiences for our guests, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that focuses on what matters most to them while positioning Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation,\" Good said.\n\nThe employees at the center of the labor fight include custodians, ride operators, candymakers and merchandise clerks at the popular theme park and resort complex, a pillar of the tourism economy in Southern California.\n\nThe workers entered into contract negotiations with the entertainment giant on April 24. Nearly two months later, on June 10, Disney workers announced that they had filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.\n\nThe charges, concerning more than 675 workers, are now being investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that enforces labor law.\n\n\"Instead of working with us toward a fair contract, Disney has engaged in multiple instances of conduct we allege are unfair labor practices, including unlawful discipline and intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work,\" the Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said in a statement ahead of the vote.\n\n\"We know these actions are only an attempt to stop us from exercising our rights and saddle us with a contract that perpetuates the status quo at Disney,\" the bargaining committee added.\n\nThe union buttons in question depict a Mickey Mouse-style white glove raised in a fist.\n\nGood said the costumes cast members wear are \"a critical part of enhancing the experience of our Disney show.\"\n\n\"Anything that distracts from the show or story, be it a non-approved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader,\" she said.\n\nIn recent years, labor scholars have drawn public attention to the economic struggles of employees at Disneyland and other major theme parks across the country.\n\nIn early 2018, for example, researchers at Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group, released a report that found 74% of Disneyland workers could not cover basic expenses each month. The report surveyed employees who had experienced homelessness, food insecurity and other challenges.\n\nIn an internal survey of union members conducted earlier this year, 28% of Disneyland cast members reported experiencing food insecurity, 33% reported experiencing housing insecurity in the last year, and 42% reported needing to miss work for medical treatment because they did not have enough sick leave.\n\nThe unions said in announcing the strike authorization that 64% of cast members are spending more than half their monthly paychecks on rent.\n\nThe four unions that represent the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW); the Teamsters Local 495; and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired June 16. The contract for cast members at Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney expires Sept. 30.\n\nThe last time Disneyland was hit with a strike was September 1984, when nearly 2,000 cast members walked off the job for 22 days.\n\nWhile the the Disney workers' bargaining committee said that that it committed to negotiations on Monday and Tuesday, it said the strike authorization allows it to call a strike at any time.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice", "type":

Ms Carranza says she makes $20.65 an hour (about \u00a315.99) at the park but last summer, she couldn't afford rent in this Southern California city where the average apartment can run more than $2,000 (about \u00a31,550) a month.\n\nMs Carranza teared up as she recounted the struggles of that summer, including sneaking for showers in Disneyland's costume department. She now shares a small apartment with her boyfriend, who also works at the park, but still makes barely enough to make ends meet.\n\n\"That's not something that anybody should experience working a full-time job for a company like Disney,\" she told the BBC.\n\nMs Carranza, like others who work at the park, detailed to the BBC the financial hardships that come with working at what's supposed to be the \"Happiest Place on Earth\". About 10,000 union workers at Disneyland - the first of 12 parks created around the globe - are threatening to strike over the wages and what they say are retaliatory anti-union practices.\n\nHundreds of workers protested outside the park this week, with an array of signs and pins showing Mickey Mouse's gloved fist in defiance.\n\n\"Mickey would want fair pay,\" workers chanted outside Disneyland near the park's gates.\n\nThey are voting on Friday on whether to authorize a strike, days before union contract negotiations for workers are set to resume.\n\nA vote to authorise a strike does not mean a strike is imminent, but it could set workers up to act quickly if negotiations sour. Authorisation also gives the unions leverage as talks continue next week.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired 16 June, and the current negotiations involves a coalition of unions that represent nearly 10,000 employees at the park, which includes everyone from those who work as characters and operate rides to sales, restaurant, and janitorial workers.\n\nUnion officials say about one in 10 Disneyland cast members have experienced homelessness while working at the park. A survey of employees showed 73% say they don't make enough to cover basic expenses each month and about a third said they experienced housing insecurity within the last year.\n\n\"We're the ones who make the magic,\" says L Slaughter, a host at the Toontown-themed part of the park. \"We need Disney to pay us a liveable wage.\"\n\nMs Slaughter spent two years living in her car while working at the park. She now has a small apartment about an hour's drive from Disneyland.\n\nShe spent a lot of that time trying to find a safe parking spot to sleep, she says, adding that staff are not allowed to sleep in the Disneyland parking lots.\n\n\"My rent just went up $200 and I won't be able to make rent again,\" she says.\n\nMs Slaughter makes $19.90 an hour - thanks to a minimum wage mandate passed by city voters in 2018. Disney unsuccessfully fought the wage hike, but workers say it's still not enough to survive in Southern California.\n\nA living wage calculator built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, says a single person with no children would need to be paid $30.48 an hour to afford to live near Disneyland in Orange County, which is about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nWorkers who talked to the BBC said they have kept their jobs at the park because they love the Disney brand, and they rely on the generous healthcare benefits and union-operated food bank, which some workers described as a saving-grace.\n\nDisney says it is committed to negotiations with its \"cast members\" - the company's term for employees who play princesses and pirates as well as the chefs or janitors who maintain the park.\n\n\"We respect and value our cast members and recognize the important role they play in creating happiness for our guests,\" Disney said in a statement, adding that talks with the unions representing its workers will resume 22 July and they are committed to reaching a deal \"that focuses on what matters most to our current cast members, helps us attract new cast, and positions Disneyland Resort for growth and the creation of more jobs\".\n\nThe last Disneyland strike was in 1984, and it lasted 22 days.\n\nMs Carranza described the back-breaking work she does nightly at the park - cleaning, polishing, repairing floors and sometimes installing carpets.\n\nShe said last summer living in her car was the lowest point in her life, and she credits her dogs with keeping her alive.\n\n\"I know that they're the reason why I'm still here, why I didn't let go,\" she said. \"There were times when I questioned what I was doing here and how I was going to get back on my feet.\"\n\nBut even with the small studio apartment Ms Carranza now has, she says she's still living paycheck-to-paycheck and sometimes can only afford to eat rice or noodles.\n\nAlthough workers' demands are economic, the vote to strike was called in response to complaints that workers were disciplined for wearing the Mickey badges and distributing union information in the park.\n\nIn June, the unions filed unfair labour practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney for \"unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work.\"\n\nColleen Palmer, one of the negotiators from Local UFCW 324, has worked at Disneyland for nearly 37 years and makes almost $24 an hour as a \"merchandise hostess\". She says she wore her union badge for less than half an hour before management told her to take it off.\n\nPalmer says workers are responsible for the experience that customers enjoy at Disneyland, and that her loyalty and experience should be rewarded. She said workers believe the pay gap between the workers and the company's executives is outrageous: Disney CEO Bob Iger's compensation was $31.6 million in 2023 - hundreds of times the amount Disneyland cast members earn.\n\n\"It makes me wonder, why don't you want to recognize me? Because I'm making you that money, so that you can buy that sports team now,\" she said, referring to news that Mr Iger and his wife had taken over the LA women's soccer team, Angel City Football Club.\n\nThe disparity between workers pay and management has been fuelling labour unrest in the United States. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, CEO compensation rose 1,460 percent between 1978 and 2021.\n\nDisneyland is a unique workplace. Many consider it a career, not a job, and workers are often also fans of the Disney brand - some call it the cult of Disney.\n\nWorkers get perks like free admission to Disney parks for their family and friends. But they also say Disney is not flexible when they have a family crisis or get sick. Many have second and third jobs that Disneyland's unpredictable schedules make challenging to juggle.\n\nFor students and retirees working part-time, it can be a dream job, but it no longer provides a living wage for people in and around Anaheim, a wealthy city whose biggest employer is Disney, workers say.\n\n\"Without us, Disney would be like anywhere else,\" says Morgan, who lived in motels around Disneyland for four years with his children and wanted to be identified by his middle name only.\n\nThe breakup of Morgan's marriage caused him to lose his housing and cheap motels were all he could afford with his Disney wages. When his children were with their mother, he often slept outside and hid in shadows to avoid police or theft.\n\nHe now has a second full-time job as a recruiter - which he can do from home - and an apartment he can afford with the combined income.\n\nStill, he takes pride in his job selling Disney merchandise and says every cast member takes the job seriously.\n\n\"It's not the animatronics - it's us. At least respect us enough to pay us a decent wage.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It would be the first at Disney's original resort in 40 years.\n\nUnion leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of a limited duration, unlike the open-ended strikes by actors' and writers' unions in 2023.\n\nThis potential strike, approved by 99% of those who voted, would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work.\n\nThe SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 unions all filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they said were hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work.\n\nHowever, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a liveable wage.\n\nCyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight, so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them.\n\nShe then spent around four months of last year going \"home\" to a car because she couldn't afford to rent a place with a bed with her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs.\n\nWhile she now shares an apartment with a roommate, Ms Carranza also had to live in a hotel for a period of time because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months' rent.\n\nHer Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift.\n\n\"It's upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I'm making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\" Ms Carranza said.\n\nAs of April 1, California's minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers.\n\nVoters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort's employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024.\n\nBut in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough.\n\nDisneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage.\n\nA strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June.\n\nAnother 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort's other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments.\n\nTogether, they represent about 40% of the entire resort's employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now. The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled for on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThese groups do not include the character and parade performers who organised in May as part of Actors' Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process.\n\n(Figures from the UFCW Local 324 union)\n\nOn the issue of union badges, the National Labor Relations Board is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional director could decide if the case merits a hearing.\n\nDisneyland officials said the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks' uniform policy and that only a \"handful\" of employees have been disciplined.\n\nIn a statement, officials said the parks strive to give guests \"an uninterrupted, immersive experience,\" and that \"anything that distracts from the show or story, be it a non-approved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader\".\n\nEvery employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, which is why cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes.\n\nThe term \"cast member\" refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Only repeated violations would warrant any disciplinary action, starting with a verbal warning.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disneyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Brotherhood of Teamsters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Labor Relations Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Disney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Disney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_California_Adventure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney California Adventure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors'_Equity_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Actors' Equity Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/4tYWVuxgizQjfDkSxfE4hE/c85c07a78629488879739cd52a41d1e4/GSyofxXW4AABMHm.jfif?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747825", "eventUri": "eng-9747825", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 2333, "textEnd": 2340}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

We gotta come together and let them know.\"\n\nThe Master Services Council -- an alliance of labor unions representing custodians, ride operators, candy makers, merchandise clerks and other employees at the Anaheim theme park -- scheduled the strike vote last week.\n\nDisneyland employees haven't staged a major walkout since 1984. That work stoppage lasted 22 days. The Disneyland employee contract terminated June 16, while the California Adventure and Downtown Disney agreements are set to expire Sept. 30.\n\n\"It's the first time in 40 years, and also it's a coalition of unions, so it's a potential for being a huge strike,\" said Victor Narro, project director and labor studies professor at the UCLA Labor Center.\n\n\"Post-pandemic, [the tourism] industry has recuperated, is thriving in significant ways. But working conditions ... have not improved at all.\"\n\nA strike authorization vote \"is not unusual as part of the negotiations process and does not indicate a strike is imminent or underway,\" company spokesperson Jessica Good said in a statement posted on the Disneyland website.\n\n\"We have a long-standing history of successful negotiations with the Master Services Council with our next meeting scheduled for July 22. We remain focused on reaching an agreement on a new contract that is fair and equitable for our cast members.\"\n\nThe website also notes that all Disneyland Resort parks and hotels \"will remain open and ready to welcome guests if any number\" of employees walk off the job.\n\nTensions escalated in June when the unions filed unfair labor practice charges against the company with the National Labor Relations Board for allegedly threatening to discipline hundreds of employees who wore union buttons depicting Mickey Mouse's raised fist to work.\n\nThe Master Services Council maintains that wearing the pins is a protected form of union activity and that Disney cannot legally take action against staffers for doing so. Disney contends that the buttons violate the employee dress code and that only \"a handful\" of repeat incidents have led to disciplinary action, starting with a verbal warning.\n\nDisneyland Resort employees have affixed the buttons to their uniforms in a show of solidarity amid their contract negotiations with the company, which began in late April.\n\nSome 14,000 workers at Disneyland, Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney are seeking wage increases to keep up with the cost of living in Southern California and reward senior employees, as well as stronger safety measures and changes to Disney's attendance policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, more than 400 Disneyland Resort staffers rallied outside the main entrance to Disneyland with picket signs bearing phrases such as, \"Disney, don't be the villain\" and \"Mickey would want fair pay.\"\n\n\"With today's rally, we continue to be focused on the wellbeing of our guests and cast members,\" Good said in a statement posted on the Disneyland website.\n\n\"We remain committed to ... reaching an agreement with Master Services that focuses on what matters most to cast members, positions Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation and enables us to continue delivering incredible guest experiences.\"\n\nA key tactic in the unions' playbook has been engaging with resort guests. This month, workers distributed the forbidden Mickey buttons to park patrons and encouraged them to sign a petition endorsing the unions' campaign. The petition has amassed more than 10,000 signatures, according to the Master Services Council.\n\n\"In this industry .... tourists can be a major source of support for the union to put pressure on the employer,\" Narro said. \"I think that's an excellent strategy.\"\n\nEllie Gonzalez, a custodian at California Adventure, said she gets \"a lot of compliments\" on her union button from guests who approach her with \"love and respect.\"\n\n\"They love my button, and they know what it means,\" Gonzalez said. \"I'm so appreciative and thankful for that.\"\n\nGonzalez and other workers have expressed frustration with Disneyland Resort management for moving forward with a $1.9-billion expansion while park staffers are seeking higher pay.\n\n\"I'm pregnant with twins, so finances is definitely a stressful point for me,\" Gonzalez said.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If a strike does occur, it would be the first at Disneyland in 40 years.\n\nThe number of cast members who voted was not released, but the unions said that of the members who voted, 99% voted to authorize a strike.\n\n\"Instead of working with us toward a fair contract, Disney has engaged in multiple instances of conduct we allege are unfair labor practices, including unlawful discipline and intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work,\" the Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said in a statement ahead of the vote.\n\n\"We know these actions are only an attempt to stop us from exercising our rights and saddle us with a contract that perpetuates the status quo at Disney,\" the bargaining committee added.\n\nThe union buttons in question depict a Mickey Mouse-style white glove raised in a fist.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.\n\nThe employees at the center of the labor fight include custodians, ride operators, candymakers and merchandise clerks at the popular theme park and resort complex, a pillar of the tourism economy in Southern California.\n\nThe workers -- known in company parlance as \"cast members\" -- entered into contract negotiations with the entertainment giant on April 24. Nearly two months later, on June 10, Disney workers announced that they had filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.\n\nThe charges, concerning more than 675 workers, are now being investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that enforces labor law.\n\n\"We won't accept less than what we deserve because we know our value to Disney. The theme parks' profits come from our hard work making a trip to Disneyland a magical experience for guests. By undermining our rights, Disney has only made harder our fight to help our guests and keep our parks safe,\" the bargaining committee said.\n\nIn recent years, labor scholars have drawn public attention to the economic struggles of employees at Disneyland and other major theme parks across the country.\n\nIn early 2018, for example, researchers at Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group, released a report that found 74% of Disneyland workers could not cover basic expenses each month. The report surveyed employees who had experienced homelessness, food insecurity and other challenges.\n\nIn an internal survey of union members conducted earlier this year, 28% of Disneyland cast members reported experiencing food insecurity, 33% reported experiencing housing insecurity in the last year, and 42% reported needing to miss work for medical treatment because they did not have enough sick leave.\n\nThe unions said in announcing the strike authorization that 64% of cast members are spending more than half their monthly paychecks on rent.\n\n\"Disneyland brands itself as 'The Happiest Place on Earth' [but] the reality for park employees is largely one of economic hardship,\" the unionized workers said in a statement ahead of the vote, which took place Friday.\n\nThe four unions that represent the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW); the Teamsters Local 495; and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired June 16. The contract for cast members at Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney expires Sept. 30.\n\nThe last time Disneyland was hit with a strike was September 1984, when nearly 2,000 cast members walked off the job for 22 days.\n\nDespite the strike authorization vote, negotiations are not over.\n\nThe Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said that it has committed to return to the bargaining table on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nBut the strike authorization allows the bargaining committee to call a strike at any time, it said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

Nearly two months later, on June 10, Disney workers announced that they had filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.\n\nThe charges, concerning more than 675 workers, are now being investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that enforces labor law.\n\n\"Instead of working with us toward a fair contract, Disney has engaged in multiple instances of conduct we allege are unfair labor practices, including unlawful discipline and intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work,\" the Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said in a statement ahead of the vote.\n\n\"We know these actions are only an attempt to stop us from exercising our rights and saddle us with a contract that perpetuates the status quo at Disney,\" the bargaining committee added.\n\nThe union buttons in question depict a Mickey Mouse-style white glove raised in a fist.\n\nIn recent years, labor scholars have drawn public attention to the economic struggles of employees at Disneyland and other major theme parks across the country.\n\nIn early 2018, for example, researchers at Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group, released a report that found 74% of Disneyland workers could not cover basic expenses each month. The report surveyed employees who had experienced homelessness, food insecurity and other challenges.\n\nIn an internal survey of union members conducted earlier this year, 28% of Disneyland cast members reported experiencing food insecurity, 33% reported experiencing housing insecurity in the last year, and 42% reported needing to miss work for medical treatment because they did not have enough sick leave.\n\nThe unions said in announcing the strike authorization that 64% of cast members are spending more than half their monthly paychecks on rent.\n\nThe four unions that represent the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW); the Teamsters Local 495; and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired June 16. The contract for cast members at Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney expires Sept. 30.\n\nThe last time Disneyland was hit with a strike was September 1984, when nearly 2,000 cast members walked off the job for 22 days.\n\nDespite the strike authorization vote, negotiations are not over.\n\nThe Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said that it has committed to return to the bargaining table on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nBut the strike authorization allows the bargaining committee to call a strike at any time, it said.\n\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com.

This move comes after months of failed negotiations with Disney management, with the workers' contract having expired in June.\n\nEmployees, known as \"cast members,\" say they are struggling to afford basic necessities in Southern California's expensive housing market, with some even experiencing homelessness while working at the park. Union officials say about one in 10 Disneyland cast members have faced homelessness, and a survey revealed that 73% of employees don't earn enough to cover basic expenses.\n\nCynthia Carranza, an overnight custodian at Disneyland, has shared her struggles with making ends meet while working at the \"Happiest Place on Earth.\" Earning $20.65 an hour, she was unable to afford rent in the expensive Southern California city last summer, forcing her to live in her car with her two dogs. She recounted tearfully the hardships she faced, including having to sneak showers in the park's costume department. Although she now shares a small apartment with her boyfriend, also a Disneyland employee, their combined income is still barely enough to cover their expenses.\n\nExpressing her frustration, Ms. Carranza stated to the BBC, \"That's not something that anybody should experience working a full-time job for a company like Disney.\" Her experience mirrors that of many other Disneyland workers who are grappling with financial hardships despite working for a company renowned for its magical image. Approximately 10,000 union workers at Disneyland are now threatening to strike over low wages and what they perceive as retaliatory anti-union practices.\n\nWorkers are demanding a livable wage that reflects the high cost of living in the area. They also accuse Disney of retaliating against union members who have been wearing union badges and distributing information in the park.\n\nDisney maintains that it is committed to reaching a fair deal with its employees and values their contribution to the park's success. However, workers are frustrated with the company's lack of progress in negotiations and the perceived disparity between their wages and those of Disney executives.\n\nThe last strike at Disneyland occurred in 1984 and lasted 22 days. If the current negotiations fail, a new strike could disrupt operations at the iconic theme park and further strain relations between Disney and its workforce.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disneyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Parks, Experiences and Products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union busting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/61721416098-5/61721416098-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747825", "eventUri": "eng-9747825", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The results of the vote will be revealed on Saturday.\n\nMany workers have complained that they can't make ends meet in expensive southern California, where some minimum wage workers have described how they have lived in their vehicles while working for the entertainment giant.\n\nThe alliance organization that represents the union, the Master Services Council, covers many of the workers from custodians, ride operators and merchandising clerks.\n\nThe contract for Disneyland workers ran out on June 16.

It's worth noting that this doesn't mean a strike is guaranteed to happen.\n\nDisneyland workers have been calling for higher wages in the days leading up to the strike vote. That saw many of them protest outside of the entertainment facility on Wednesday. This is worth noting as that was the 69th anniversary of the park.\n\nDisney negotiators are currently preparing for a meeting with union officials representing its theme park workers. They are set to open negotiations again on Monday with talks expected to continue through Tuesday.\n\nIf Disney is unable to reach an agreement with the union officials, it could spell trouble for its park. The union represents more than 9,500 employees whose contract with Disneyland expired on Tuesday.\n\nThe contract covers a wide range of Disneyland employees. That includes cast members, hotel employees, restaurant workers and more.

Nearly two months later, on June 10, Disney workers announced that they had filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.\n\nThe charges, concerning more than 675 workers, are now being investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that enforces labor law.\n\n\"We won't accept less than what we deserve because we know our value to Disney. The theme parks' profits come from our hard work making a trip to Disneyland a magical experience for guests. By undermining our rights, Disney has only made harder our fight to help our guests and keep our parks safe,\" the bargaining committee said.\n\nIn recent years, labor scholars have drawn public attention to the economic struggles of employees at Disneyland and other major theme parks across the country.\n\nIn early 2018, for example, researchers at Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group, released a report that found 74% of Disneyland workers could not cover basic expenses each month. The report surveyed employees who had experienced homelessness, food insecurity and other challenges.\n\nIn an internal survey of union members conducted earlier this year, 28% of Disneyland cast members reported experiencing food insecurity, 33% reported experiencing housing insecurity in the last year, and 42% reported needing to miss work for medical treatment because they did not have enough sick leave.\n\n\"Disneyland brands itself as 'The Happiest Place on Earth' [but] the reality for park employees is largely one of economic hardship,\" the unionized workers said in a statement ahead of the vote, which took place Friday.\n\nThe four unions that represent the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW); the Teamsters Local 495; and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324.\n\nThe contract for cast members at Disneyland expired June 16. The contract for cast members at Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney expires Sept. 30.\n\nThe last time Disneyland was hit with a strike was September 1984, when nearly 2,000 cast members walked off the job for 22 days.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice",

It also follows news that Disneyland character performers recently unionized with Actors' Equity Association.\n\nGinny Cristales works at Candy Palace on Disneyland's Main Street.

It would be the first in 40 years", "body": "ANAHEIM, Calif. (CNN) -- Cyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them.\n\nBut after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went \"home\" to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren't enough to afford renting a place with a bed.\n\nNow, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where thousands overwhelmingly voted Friday to authorize a potential strike.\n\nNow that the vote has passed, it's up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney's original resort in 40 years.\n\n\"Today Disneyland Park cast members made their voices heard by voting to authorize the Disney Workers Rising bargaining committee to call for a strike to protest unfair labor practices by 99%,\" UFCW Local 324 said in a statement. \"We stood up and showed Disney that we won't sit by and allow them to intimidate, surveil and unlawfully discipline cast members for exercising their rights.\"\n\nDisneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good told CNN in an email late Friday that it remains committed to reaching an agreement.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate the important roles our cast members play in creating memorable experiences for our guests, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that focuses on what matters most to them while positioning Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation,\" Good said. \"Master Services Council's strike authorization is not unusual as part of a negotiations process, and we look forward to continuing discussions at upcoming meetings on Monday, July 22 and Tuesday, July 23. A strike date has not been scheduled, and Disneyland Resort continues to welcome guests.\"\n\nDisneyland officials previously said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike.\n\nUnion leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors' and writers' unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023.\n\nStrike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year.\n\nWhile this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage.\n\nCarranza's Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors.\n\n\"It's upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I'm making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\" Carranza said.\n\nAs of April 1, California's minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort's employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024.\n\nBut in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough.\n\nAfter Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months' rent for an apartment.\n\nToday, she shares an apartment with a roommate.\n\nChange at the Disneyland Resort - and in affordability in Southern California in general - has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years.\n\nWhen she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400/month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000/month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there's utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn't travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog.\n\n\"It does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\" Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they've been doing around the park and telling them they've been brave to try the thrill rides.\n\nPalmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city's minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.\n\nDisneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage.\n\nA strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June.\n\nAnother 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort's other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments.\n\nTogether, they represent about 40% of the entire resort's employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now.\n\nThe unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThese groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors' Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process.\n\nOfficially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist.\n\nSEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work.\n\nThe NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing.\n\nDisneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks' uniform policy and that only a \"handful\" of employees have been disciplined.\n\nDisneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests \"an uninterrupted,\u202fimmersive experience,\" and that \"anything that distracts from the\u202fshow or story, be it a\u202fnon-approved\u202fbutton, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.\"\n\nThe term \"cast member\" refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nDisney's policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the \"show.\" Only\u202frepeated violations\u202fwould warrant any\u202fdisciplinary\u202faction, starting with a verbal warning.", "source":

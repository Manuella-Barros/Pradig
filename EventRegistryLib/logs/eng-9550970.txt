Henry Cuellar and a political and business consultant have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to help the Democrat congressman from Texas launder more than $200,000 in bribes and to assist prosecutors in a federal criminal investigation, according to court documents unsealed this week.\n\nColin Strother, Cuellar's former chief of staff and campaign manager, and Florencia Rendon, a business consultant and former chief of staff for former U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, struck plea deals in March to ensure their cooperation in a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into Cuellar and his wife.\n\nThe Cuellars have been charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico, in exchange for advancing the interests of the country and the bank in the U.S.\n\nCuellar, 68, has said he and his wife Imelda Cuellar, 67, are innocent.\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe plea agreements by Strother, 50, and Rendon, 73, are related to laundering money from Mexico. The agreements were ordered unsealed on Wednesday. Both men agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Strother faces up to five years in prison, and Rendon faces up to 20 years.\n\nInvestigators said Rendon and Cuellar were at a conference in Mexico City in 2015 when they hatched a plan to arrange meetings with executives of Mexican banks needing help with transfers of money from Mexican workers and to draft fake contracts for consulting services to be provided by Imelda Cuellar. According to the indictment against the Cuellars, she \"performed little or no legitimate work\" in exchange for payment.\n\nRendon knew the contract was a \"sham consulting contract\" and that the payments of $15,000 per month were made to funnel money to Cuellar, the plea agreement said.\n\nRendon would send $11,000 a month to Strother, who would in turn transfer monthly payments to the Cuellars of $10,000. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to the Cuellars, according to the plea agreement.\n\nAt one point in 2018, Cuellar confronted Strother in a restaurant parking lot about missed payments to his wife, and Strother produced a spreadsheet on his phone to assure him the payments were up to date, the plea deal said.\n\n\"As long as Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried,\" Cuellar attorney Chris Flood said. \"At the right time the Judge in this case will warn everyone about the credibility of Strother and Rendon if they don't.\"\n\nAttorneys for Strother and Rendon did not immediately return email and telephone messages seeking comment.\n\nCuellar and his wife surrendered to authorities last week and were briefly taken into custody. They made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond.\n\nThe FBI searched the congressman's house in the border city of Laredo in 2022, and Cuellar's attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the target of that investigation.\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said last week. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\"\n\nCuellar, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, narrowly defeated progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros by fewer than 300 votes in a primary race in 2022.", "source":

Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and his wife for alleged bribery and foreign influence on 'Special Report.'\n\nFormer President Trump and the Democratic House Caucus both came to the defense of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who was indicted for allegedly taking bribes to benefit a Mexican bank and the Azerbaijan government.\n\nWhile Trump and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., both nodded to Cuellar's respectable reputation, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee went a step further, accusing President Biden of using the Justice Department to retaliate against the Democratic congressman for demanding tougher border security policies - stepping outside the party line.\n\nAguilar, meanwhile, praised Cuellar's record of having \"deep relationships with Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues on both sides of the aisle,\" arguing that while the allegations against him are \"very serious,\" they are also \"very different\" from the indictments faced by former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J.\n\nAt Tuesday's leadership press conference, Aguilar was asked why he and other Democratic colleagues had not called on Cuellar to resign or be expelled from Congress as they had done after Santos was indicted by the Justice Department on fraud, identity theft, falsification of records, credit card fraud and other charges. Santos was ultimately expelled after just one year in Congress following a scathing House ethics report.\n\nDEMOCRATIC TEXAS REP. HENRY CUELLAR INDICTED BY DOJ ON CONSPIRACY AND BRIBERY CHARGES\n\n\"This is an incredibly serious issue. It's not lost on House Democrats how serious this is. Representative Cuellar has done the right thing in stepping down from his committees, stepping down from his position as chief deputy whip and ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee,\" Aguilar said. \"He's entitled to make his defense. He is entitled to the presumption of innocence. We look forward to that process playing out. And just like every American is entitled to that presumption, I think that's the overwhelming feeling of House Democrats at this point.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post days earlier, Trump addressed the indictment against Cuellar, whose district sits along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"Biden just Indicted Henry Cuellar because the Respected Democrat Congressman wouldn't play Crooked Joe's Open Border game,\" Trump claimed Sunday. \"He was for Border Control, so they said, 'Let's use the FBI and DOJ to take him out!' This is the way they operate. They're a bunch of D.C. Thugs, and at some point they will be paying a very big price for what they have done to our Country.\"\n\n\"CROOKED JOE BIDEN IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!\" Trump added.\n\nIn a federal indictment unsealed in the Southern District of Texas on Friday, Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were charged with accepting approximately $600,000 from Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress in two schemes involving bribery, unlawful foreign influence and money laundering.\n\nThe bribe payments were allegedly laundered, pursuant to sham consulting contracts, through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, \"who performed little to no legitimate work under the contracts,\" the Justice Department said. The schemes were said to have been carried out from at least December 2014 through at least November 2021.\n\nIn exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Rep. Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan, according to court documents. Rep. Cuellar also allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and \"to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial\" to the Mexican bank.\n\nThe indictment centers around Banco Azteca, owned by one of Mexico's richest men, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing an unnamed U.S. official. Federal prosecutors allege the Mexican bank funneled $238,000 in bribes disguised as consulting fees to Cuellar, according to the newspaper.\n\nSEN BOB MENENDEZ MAY BLAME HIS WIFE NADINE DURING FEDERAL CORRUPTION TRIAL: COURT DOCS\n\nCuellar and his wife both pleaded not guilty in federal court in Houston on Friday and were each released on an unsecured $100,000 bond.\n\nAguilar on Tuesday slammed the \"silliness of George Santos\" when further pressed by reporters about the difference in Democratic response to Cuellar's indictment.\n\nThe Democratic House Caucus chair said he read the indictment against Cuellar and said the \"incredibly serious allegations\" are treated with the \"utmost respect\" by the Democratic caucus.\n\n\"He's entitled to that presumption of innocence, as any American would. I have not talked with Representative Cuellar since the indictment came out,\" Aguilar said. \"But that said, you know, I will say that Representative Cuellar has been for decades, he's been a legislator. He's been a statewide officeholder in Texas. He has deep relationships with Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We know that he is a serious, you know, public official and public servant. And I think that's what sets this apart from other issues and the silliness of George Santos that we had in the past. And I think that's why many of us are treating this a little different. The substance of the allegations is very different, but the individuals are also night and day.\"\n\nWhen asked about Menendez, Aguilar pointed to how the indictments against the longtime New Jersey senator included photos supporting the DOJ's allegations that he allegedly accepted bribes to benefit the Egyptian government, including images depicting gold bars, a luxury vehicle and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that prosecutors say was sewn into jackets or otherwise found during an FBI search of Menendez's home.\n\n\"The substance of these allegations is very different,\" Aguilar said. \"I made some comments on that indictment, and I hold true to those, I think that these are very different. There were some, you know, pictures and there were some things that were very different with respect to the allegations. So he's entitled to the presumption of innocence. And I would say that these allegations from all three individuals are very different.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement released last week, House Democratic Caucus Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also defended how Cuellar \"has admirably devoted his career to public service.\"\n\n\"Like any American, Congressman Cuellar is entitled to his day in court and the presumption of innocence throughout the legal process. Pursuant to House Democratic Caucus Rule 24, Congressman Cuellar will take leave as Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee while this matter is ongoing,\" Jeffries said.",

Henry Cuellar to launder more than $200,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank, according to recently unsealed court documents that show the consultants are cooperating with the Justice Department in its case against the Laredo Democrat.\n\nCuellar, a powerful South Texas Democrat, was indicted with his wife Imelda on charges of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican commercial bank. The indictment, unsealed last week, accuses Cuellar of taking money from the bank in exchange for influencing the Treasury Department to work around an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank's interests. Cuellar allegedly recruited his former campaign manager, Colin Strother, and another consultant, Florencio \"Lencho\" Rendon, to facilitate the payments, according to court records.\n\nRendon and Strother both struck plea deals with the Justice Department in March, in which they agreed to cooperate in the agency's investigation of the Cuellar. They each face up to 20 years in prison and six-figure fines for charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe plea deals, which were first reported by the San Antonio Express-News, allege that Cuellar first asked Strother to meet with Rendon in February 2016 to \"participate in a project to test and certify a fuel additive made by a Mexican company ... so that it could be sold in the United States.\" Rendon told Strother he would pay him $11,000 a month for the project, $10,000 of which Strother would pass on to Imelda Cuellar, according to the plea agreements.\n\nRendon paid Strother a total of $261,000 from March 2016 through June 2019, more than $236,000 of which Strother then paid to Imelda Cuellar, the documents allege. Strother concluded the project was \"a sham,\" according to his plea deal because neither Rendon nor Imelda Cuellar \"did any legitimate work.\" Strother \"understood that the true purpose of the payments\" was to \"funnel money\" to Henry Cuellar without the Laredo Democrat having to reveal it in his annual financial disclosures.\n\nCuellar has asserted his innocence, releasing a statement Friday in which he said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\" He faces charges of bribery, money laundering and working on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nCuellar, a member of Congress since 2005, has considerable influence in Washington thanks to his long tenure and his spot on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. He was the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees funding for homeland security, a position he automatically forfeited under a House Democratic rule that requires a committee chair to step down if they are indicted on a crime carrying a possible prison sentence of more than two years.\n\nAs part of their plea agreements, Rendon and Strother agreed to testify \"before a grand jury or in any other judicial or administrative proceeding when called upon to do so by the United States.\" Each also agreed to turn over \"all documents in his possession or under his control relating to all areas of inquiry and investigation.\"\n\nAfter news of the indictment landed, Cuellar affirmed that he still plans to seek reelection in November. Two Republicans, Navy veteran Jay Furman and rancher Lazaro Garza Jr., are facing off in a May 28 runoff to decide the GOP nominee in Cuellar's district, which stretches from the border to San Antonio.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election forecasting site, updated its rating for the district from \"likely Democratic\" to \"lean Democratic\" in response to Cuellar's indictment. Cuellar, often ranked ideologically as the most conservative Democrat in the U.S. House, won reelection in 2022 by 13 percentage points, though Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke carried the district by a narrower 5-point margin.", "source": {"uri": "kxan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KXAN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar",

Henry Cuellar to resign after a federal indictment charged the Texas Democrat with money laundering and bribery, among other criminal counts.\n\nAn indictment unsealed last week accuses Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, of taking about $600,000 in bribes from the government of Azerbaijan and an unnamed foreign bank headquartered in Mexico City.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, California Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, described the allegations as \"incredibly serious\" but did not call on Cuellar to resign.\n\n\"He's entitled to make his defense. He is entitled to the presumption of innocence. We look forward to that process playing out,\" Aguilar said. \"And just like every American, he's entitled to that presumption. I think that's the overwhelming feeling of House Democrats.\"\n\nCuellar has pledged to run for reelection, stated his and his wife's innocence, and said the actions he took in Congress were consistent with those of his colleagues. He also said he had consulted with the House Ethics Committee.\n\nThe reception from congressional Democrats is a noticeable departure from when some Democratic lawmakers called for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., to resign after federal authorities accused the senator and his wife of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes.\n\nIn the Cuellar case, the indictment says the bribe payments were laundered \"pursuant to sham consulting contracts\" through a series of front companies and middlemen into shell companies that were owned by Cuellar's wife, who did \"little or no legitimate work under the sham contracts.\"\n\nAguilar sought to draw a distinction between the Cuellar indictment and federal cases against Menendez and former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y.\n\nMenendez is set to go on trial next week in a sprawling corruption case. Santos is facing criminal charges and was expelled from the House after a notorious congressional career spent under heavy media attention and a shadow of lies.\n\nAguilar pointed to Cuellar's experience as a public official and underscored his connections to other lawmakers, saying the Texas Democrat has deep relationships with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\"We know that he is a serious public official, public servant,\" Aguilar said of Cuellar. \"And I think that's what sets this apart from other issues and the silliness of George Santos that we had in the past. And I think that's why many of us are treating this a little different.\"", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Aguilar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Aguilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mexico City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presumption of innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Santos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_cuellar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550970", "eventUri": "eng-9550970", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Rendon and Strother both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, facing up to 20 years in prison and up to five years in prison, respectively, and fines.

Federal prosecutors allege the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.\n\nRendon knew the contract was a \"sham consulting contract\" and that the payments of $15,000 per month were made to funnel money to Cuellar, Rendon's plea agreement said.\n\nRendon would send $11,000 a month to Strother, who would in turn transfer monthly payments to the Cuellars of $10,000. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to the Cuellars, according to court filings.\n\nThe Cuellars have pleaded not guilty, and were released on an unsecured bond.

Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, is facing charges of bribery, money laundering and working on behalf of a foreign government. He is the third lawmaker in Congress to face a federal indictment this session.\n\nBut unlike his other embattled colleagues, Cuellar is not yet facing a barrage of calls for him to resign.\n\nFive days after he was charged, no member of the Texas delegation, Republican or Democrat, has so far called for him to step down. The few who have offered to discuss the case stress that Cuellar deserves a fair trial like any other American. Beyond Texas, only one member of the House, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minnesota, has called on Cuellar to leave office.\n\nThe response is a stark contrast to the calls from around Congress for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, to step down after he was indicted on charges of bribery over his connections to Egypt. U.S. Reps. Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar both called on Menendez to step down last year. The two Democrats both declined to weigh in on Cuellar's case. Like Cuellar, Castro and Casar both represent districts that include San Antonio.\n\nU.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, also called for Menendez to step down last September, but she is barred from discussing the Cuellar case due to her seat on the House Ethics Committee. She could comment on the Menendez case because the House Ethics Committee does not have jurisdiction in the Senate.\n\nA host of Texas Democrats also voted to expel former Rep. George Santos, R-New York, after The New York Times uncovered he had fabricated much of his background and he received his own indictment for campaign finance violations. Six of Texas' 13 Democrats in the U.S. House voted to expel Santos from Congress last November before he had been convicted of a crime or the House Ethics Committee had concluded its investigation into his conduct (After the Ethics Committee unveiled its report, all but two voted to expel).\n\n\"George Santos should resign as Congressman-elect. If he refuses, Congress should expel him. He should also be investigated by authorities,\" Castro posted on social media after Santos was elected. \"Just about every aspect of his life appears to be a lie. We've seen people fudge their resume but this is total fabrication.\"\n\nReps. Jasmine Crockett of Dallas, Lloyd Doggett of Austin, Sylvia Garcia of Houston, Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen, Casar and Castro all voted to expel Santos before the House Ethics report. All declined to weigh in on Cuellar except for Gonzalez and Doggett, who said Cuellar was entitled to his day in court. Doggett added that Cuellar shouldn't be in a leadership position after the indictment and commended him for stepping down as top Democrat on the House Appropriations Homeland Security subcommittee.\n\n\"We have one of the greatest judicial systems in the world that would be able to hear and judge the case at some point,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-California, drew a distinction between Cuellar, a nine-term congressman, and Santos, a freshman with no public service record during a Tuesday news conference.\n\nCuellar \"has deep relationships with Republican colleagues, Democratic colleagues,\" Aguilar said. \"We know that he is a serious public official, public servant, and I think that's what sets this apart from other issues and the silliness of George Santos that we've had in the past and I think that's why many of us are treating this a little differently. The substance of the allegations are very different but the individuals are also night and day.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, said Cuellar stepping down would be a \"personal decision for him to make.\" Green voted present on the votes to expel Santos, asserting all members of Congress should be assumed innocent until properly convicted.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which was eager to flip Cuellar's seat last cycle, demanded Democrats call on Cuellar to step down after the indictment. But Republican members have also remained relatively muted since the indictment went public.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, who has a long track record working with Cuellar on bipartisan legislation, said though the \"allegations are serious, we have a justice system that will resolve his guilt or innocence.\"\n\n\"Everyone is entitled to a presumption of innocence,\" Cruz said at an event in San Antonio. Cruz took the same position on Menendez following his indictment.\n\nU.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, who is in a competitive race to hold on to her South Texas seat, and Former Rep. Mayra Flores, who is running against Gonzalez in another South Texas district, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who is challenging Cruz in the Senate race, said in a statement that the \"allegations are concerning, but like every American, Congressman Cuellar deserves his day in court to be tried before a jury of his peers.\" He voted against expelling Santos before the House Ethics report was released.\n\nCuellar was charged with setting up fake shell companies with his wife, daughter and staff to receive $600,000 in bribes from Banco Azteca in Mexico and Azerbaijan's state-run oil company. Members of Congress are prohibited from simultaneously working as an agent for a foreign government, and the Justice Department alleged Cuellar coordinated with Azerbaijani agents to kill legislation that went against the U.S.'s interests.\n\nCuellar has considerable influence in Congress as a long-serving member and the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee in charge of Homeland Security. The position made him a prime target for recruitment by Azerbaijan, which tried to kill legislation that would finance removal of landmines in a then-disputed region with Armenia.\n\nIf convicted, Cuellar could face decades in prison. Cuellar insists on his innocence.\n\n\"Congressman Cuellar's actions in this matter -- and always -- were lawful, transparent and in the best interests of the United States, and they were entirely consistent with the actions of many of his colleagues,\" Chris Floor, Cuellar's attorney, said in a statement Friday.\n\nSpeaking with reporters outside the House chamber on Tuesday, Cuellar said he had no intention of stepping down.\n\n\"All I've done is to serve my district,\" Cuellar said. When asked if he took any bribes, Cuellar said \"absolutely not.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has strict protocols on bringing an indictment against a public official, involving multiple levels of approval. The department is also sensitive to how indictments might impact elections. Cuellar is running for reelection this year in a race that was viewed as mostly safe for him before the indictment, though some forecasters have changed their ratings for the race to be more competitive.\n\n\"I'm sure the highest levels of the department were aware of, if not approved, consistent with the protocols internally, that an indictment was being brought,\" said Michael Weinstein, a former Justice Department trial attorney and federal prosecutor who was involved in political corruption cases.\n\nCuellar has been in Congress since 2005 and is a fixture in South Texas politics. He is often ranked ideologically as the most conservative member of the House Democratic Caucus and has built a reputation for impressive political resiliency, in part through his fundraising and his ability to curry favor across the political spectrum.\n\nCuellar faced a competitive primary from progressive immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros in 2022. Shortly before the two went off to a runoff, the FBI searched Cuellar's home in a highly publicized raid that later was reported to be about his connections to Azerbaijan. He was still about to defeat Cisneros that cycle by 0.6 points. Cisneros also declined to comment on Cuellar's indictment.\n\nCuellar often works on legislation with Republicans and has even campaigned for them in the past. He appeared on television interviews with U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-San Antonio, who has worked with Cuellar on cross-aisle border issues. Gonzales declined to comment on Cuellar's indictment.\n\nHis resiliency has been an asset to Democrats, particularly as Republicans make forays into flipping more South Texas districts. Republicans often say the 28th Congressional District would have been far more competitive if Cisneros had won the Democratic primary.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership rallied to defend Cuellar's right to due process. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement Friday that Cuellar had the right to assumed innocence and that he would be stepping down from his committee leadership responsibilities. A spokesperson for Congressional Hispanic Conference Chair Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, D-California, said in a statement Cuellar \"deserves his day in court to respond\".\n\nThe Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement that \"anyone who is proven to engage in such practices must be held accountable regardless of party affiliation.\" But he added that \"Unlike indictments against Republican candidates that voters must consider this November - these allegations are completely inconsistent with Congressman Cuellar's decades of distinguished service to his district, to Texas, and to our country.\"\n\nCuellar continues to see the fallout of his indictment. He is restricted from leaving South and West Texas except to go to Washington for work. He had his firearms confiscated and his chief of staff, Jacob Hochberg, departed the office this week. Hochberg is now chief of staff for Crockett.\n\nCuellar's former chief of staff and longtime campaign aide Colin Strother could also help investigators in the case, The San Antonio Express News reported. The indictment did not charge Strother but alleged he had helped launder bribes to the Cuellars. Strother directed a request for comment to his attorney, who did not respond to a Tribune inquiry.", "source": {"uri": "texastribune.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Texas Tribune"}, "authors":

Bob Menendez before him, Rep. Henry Cuellar is facing an indictment for bribery. Like Menendez, Cuellar is refusing calls to resign.\n\nIn fact, Cuellar has gone a step further. He's promised to continue running for re-election.\n\n\"Let me be clear, I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" the Texas Democrat said Friday in a statement.\n\nThe Cuellar family has become a ruling dynasty in Texas. The congressman's brother is a sheriff in Laredo, Texas. His sister was a municipal judge, and she's running for the state legislature.\n\nRep. Cuellar benefits not only from this name recognition, but also from his tendency to buck far-Left sloganeering. Cuellar has become one of the House Democrats' few pro-life voices. He's slammed President Joe Biden's administration for presiding over a record number of border crossings, and he votes with Republicans on gun control, a hot topic in Texas.\n\nCuellar is also running as a 20-year incumbent with a history of landslide elections. In 2020, Biden carried the Lone Star State's 28th congressional district by seven points. On the same ballot, Cuellar won it by more than 18 points.\n\nGranted, he came within 300 votes of losing 2022's Democratic primary to far-Left lawyer Jessica Cisneros, but he already won this year's primary.\n\nSure enough, some of Cuellar's constituents in southern Texas still support his re-election, even after expressing their alarm at the allegations.\n\nWebb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni wants the courts to remain separate from the campaign. \"We have a campaign to advance, our Democracy at stake,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"It is extremely surprising for me because I've known Henry for many, many years,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said. \"He's always been a very straight guy, you know, very sincere. I mean, he's done so much for us in Starr County. I hate to see this going on.\"\n\n[Warning] U.S. law could rob you of your IRA, 401(k), and even your pension [sponsored]\n\nCuellar, 68, looks likely to cruise toward an 11th term despite his legal woes.\n\nIn federal court, the congressman stands accused of bribery and conspiracy.\n\nCuellar and his wife, a businesswoman, were taken into custody Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the couple's ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Cuellars are accused of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar, the former co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, allegedly agreed to advance those entities' interests in the U.S.\n\nThe couple surrendered to authorities, made an initial appearance before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000 bond, the DOJ said.\n\nIn a statement, Cuellar described himself and his wife as \"innocent of these allegations.\"\n\n\"Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar added.\n\nMenendez has missed the deadline to run for re-election as a Democrat, but he may still run as an independent.", "source": {"uri": "thehornnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Horn News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darrian_johnson@thehornnews.com", "name": "Darrian Johnson",

Henry Cuellar to launder more than $200,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank, according to recently unsealed court documents that show the consultants are cooperating with the Justice Department in its case against the Laredo Democrat.\n\n[Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar indicted on charges of bribery, money laundering]\n\nCuellar, a powerful South Texas Democrat, was indicted with his wife Imelda on charges of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank. The indictment, unsealed last week, accuses Cuellar of taking money from the commercial bank in exchange for influencing the Treasury Department to work around an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank's interests. Cuellar allegedly recruited his former campaign manager, Colin Strother, and another consultant, Florencio \"Lencho\" Rendon, to facilitate the payments, according to court records.\n\nRendon and Strother both struck plea deals with the Justice Department in March, in which they agreed to cooperate in the agency's investigation of the Cuellars. They each face up to 20 years in prison and six-figure fines for charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe plea deals, which were first reported by the San Antonio Express-News, allege that Cuellar first asked Strother to meet with Rendon in February 2016 to \"participate in a project to test and certify a fuel additive made by a Mexican company ... so that it could be sold in the United States.\" Rendon told Strother he would pay him $11,000 a month for the project, $10,000 of which Strother would pass on to Imelda Cuellar, according to the plea agreements.\n\nRendon paid Strother a total of $242,000 from March 2016 to December 2017, nearly $215,000 of which Strother then paid to Imelda Cuellar, the documents allege. Strother concluded the project was \"a sham,\" according to his plea deal, because neither Rendon nor Imelda Cuellar \"did any legitimate work.\" Strother \"understood that the true purpose of the payments\" was to \"funnel money\" to Henry Cuellar without the Laredo Democrat having to reveal it in his annual financial disclosures.\n\nCuellar has asserted his innocence, releasing a statement Friday in which he said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Texas Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Express-News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Express-News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/u-s-rep-jerry-nadler-d-ny-left-u00a0and-u-s-rep-henry-cuellar-d-tx-right-depart-a-leadership-election-meeting-with-t.jpg?id=51714237&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C516%2C0%2C516", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550970", "eventUri": "eng-9550970", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-", "dateEnd": "2017-12-", "textStart": 2166, "textEnd": 2193}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-02-", "textStart": 1798, "textEnd": 1811}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Anthony D'Esposito, who led the successful drive to expel ex-Rep. George Santos from the House for his alleged crimes, said this week that Democrats should move to expel indicted Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) as well.\n\n\"Members of Congress who disgrace the reputation of this institution have no place serving as legislators, and it is time for the Democrats to hold Henry Cuellar accountable just as Republicans held George Santos accountable,\" D'Esposito (R-Island Park) told Newsday.\n\nThe federal indictment Friday of Cuellar and his wife marks the first test of the new \"Santos standard\" for expulsion from the House. It has prompted a divided response among Republicans and Democrats about whether the House also should expel Cuellar, who has not been convicted.\n\nAnd it raises questions about whether that standard should apply to all federal public offices, including the White House and candidates such as former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who is on trial in a New York hush-money case and faces three other criminal indictments.\n\nThe House voted to expel Santos (R-Nassau/Queens) based on his admitted lies about his background, a federal 23-count indictment and a damning House Ethics Committee investigative report. The two previous House members expelled had been tried and convicted of federal crimes.\n\n\"The Santos precedent is that a criminal prosecution is not needed to expel a member if the Ethics Committee enforces the ethics laws,\" said Kedric Payne, general counsel and senior director for ethics at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nFederal prosecutors unveiled the indictment Friday against Cuellar and his wife for conspiracy and bribery for accepting nearly $600,000 from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company, a bank in Mexico and Cuellar's advancement of their interests in the United States. The congressman and his wife, Imelda, have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee has not issued a statement about Cuellar.\n\nRepublicans offered divided opinions about Cuellar, reflecting the split that occurred in the Santos vote.\n\n\"I feel that the Republicans have spent the 118th Congress holding people accountable that violate this government and that was one of the reasons as to why we led the charge in expelling George Santos,\" D'Esposito said.\n\n\"And I think that if my friends on the other side of the aisle want to hold their own party accountable, they should do just that,\" he said.\n\nBut Rep. Jim Jordon (R-Ohio), who voted against the Santos expulsion, said Tuesday Cuellar's fate should be up to voters. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who voted for Santos's ouster, also dismissed the idea of expelling Cuellar.\n\nDemocrats defended Cuellar while acknowledging the damaging indictment.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-Brooklyn) on Friday praised Cuellar's devotion to public service and said he is entitled to \"presumption of innocence throughout the legal process.\"\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), the House Democratic Caucus chairman, argued at a news conference Tuesday that the cases against Santos and Cuellar differ.\n\n\"We know that [Cuellar] is a serious public official, public servant. And I think that's what sets this apart from other issues and the silliness of George Santos,\" Aguilar said. \"That's why, many of us are treating this a little different: The substance of the allegations is very different, but the individuals are also night and day.\"\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove) said in a statement about Cuellar: \"No one is above the law. These troubling allegations must be fully investigated.\"\n\nRepublicans accused House Democrats of a \"double standard.\"\n\nSuzanne Viar, a National Republican Campaign Committee spokeswoman said, \"Democrats had plenty to say about George Santos yet remain largely silent about their own colleague.\"\n\nBut House Republicans have had their own disputes: House Republican leaders voted against expelling Santos but nearly half their members voted for it.\n\nSome Republicans urging the ouster of Cuellar give Trump a pass.\n\nD'Esposito and Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Amityville) on Tuesday sidestepped questions about whether Trump should be barred from public office because of his indictments. LaLota said, \"That's not before the House proceedings.\"\n\nCraig Holman, the Capitol Hill lobbyist on ethics for Public Citizen, a consumer and public interest nonprofit, questioned the calls to expel Cuellar by politicians supporting Trump.\n\n\"It just shows really sharp, polarized partisan politics,\" Holman said, \"and it has little to do with respecting any standards for ethics.\"",

Cuellar and wife INDICTED following allegations they received BRIBES from Azerbaijan   - NaturalNews.com", "body": "According to the indictment, the Cuellars accepted roughly $600,000 in bribes from a bank in Mexico and an oil and gas company linked to Azerbaijan in exchange for the congressman performing official acts from 2014 to 2021. These bribe payments were allegedly laundered through sham consulting contracts and a network of intermediary companies, with Imelda's shell companies serving as conduits.\n\nCuellar previously served as a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus. In exchange for the bribes, Cuellar allegedly committed to influencing legislation concerning Azerbaijan's conflict with Armenia, inserting favorable language for Azerbaijan into security and economic aid programs, delivering a supportive speech on the House floor and providing consultation to Azerbaijani officials regarding their lobbying efforts in the U.S. government. (Related: Armenia and Azerbaijan on the brink of a FULL-SCALE WAR following alleged provocations.)\n\n\"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Azerbaijani oil and gas company, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to use his office to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,\" the DOJ said. \"In exchange for the bribes paid by the Mexican bank, Congressman Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence legislative activity and to advise and pressure high-ranking U.S. Executive Branch officials regarding measures beneficial to the bank.\"\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

But for the meantime, Cuellar will step aside from his position as the top Democrat in the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.\n\nCuellar has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, even before the charges against him were publicized. He also stressed his wife's professional qualifications and denounced the allegations against her as baseless attacks on her character.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar said. \"The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\"\n\n\"Imelda and I have been married for 32 years. On top of being an amazing wife and mother, she's an accomplished businesswoman with two degrees,\" Cuellar continued. \"She spent her career working with banking, tax and consulting. The allegation that she is anything but qualified and hardworking is both wrong and offensive.\"\n\nCuellar's defense attorneys echoed similar sentiments but also underscored that the timing of the incident occurred just six months before the upcoming November election.\n\n\"The government's decision to move forward with charges so close to the general election - and their decision to execute a search warrant 40 days before his [2022] primary - undermines the electorate and puts a thumb on the scale,\" said attorneys Chris Flood and Eric Reed.\n\nBut despite the legal cloud hanging over him, Cuellar remains resolute in seeking reelection in the upcoming election. \"Let me be clear: I'm running for re-election and will win this November,\" Cuellar boasted.\n\nMore of the latest news about the blatant political corruption in the U.S. government can be found at Corruption.news.\n\nWatch this clip of refugees from the Armenian enclave of Artsakh discussing the war crimes Azerbaijani soldiers have committed against them.\n\nU.S. giving weapons to Israel, which is selling them to Azerbaijan to MASSACRE CHRISTIANS.\n\nBlood money: The top ten politicians taking the most Israel lobby cash.\n\nNew Jersey Sen.

You might remember that Cuellar was openly critical of the Biden border crisis in the latter half of 2021. Approximately a few weeks after Cuellar was openly and strongly criticizing Biden, FBI agents raided his home {BACKSTORY}.\n\nAt the time of the FBI raid (January 2022), everyone noted the visible connection between Cuellar's criticism of Biden and the launch of the DOJ investigation against him. The timing was just too convenient.\n\nLast Friday an indictment was unsealed. Representative Cuellar and his wife are each charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit bribery of a federal official and to have a public official act as an agent of a foreign principal; two counts of bribery of a federal official; two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; two counts of violating the ban on public officials acting as agents of a foreign principal; one count of conspiracy to commit concealment money laundering; and five counts of money laundering.\n\nInterestingly, the charges and the activity date back to 2014 and continue over the next ten years culminating in the indictment a decade later.\n\nI would strongly urge people to read THE 54-PAGE INDICTMENT.\n\nWhat you realize when you read the indictment is exactly what we have talked about on these pages for well over a decade, the business end of American politics. Cuellar and his wife are a case study in how the average federal politician gets wealthy from selling their office.\n\nAll of the DC politicians participate in this type of influence selling. There are ZERO federal elected officials who do not participate in this process. And within that dynamic we find the answer to how the Intelligence Community exists to control all of the DC political systems without any checks in their authority.\n\nOne of the primary reasons the Intelligence Community was so fast to join the effort to eliminate the threat Donald Trump represented in 2016 was specifically due to the lack of corrupt activity (IC blackmail) that could be leveraged against him. Absent the ability to control the target the IC must create leverage.\n\nThe intelligence institutions in collaboration with the weaponized justice institutions create the fourth branch of government. It was this system that was fine-tuned by Barack Obama and Eric Holder to target their political opposition.\n\nRepresentative Henry Cuellar is a warning to the other compromised people in Washington DC not to challenge the administrative state. The \"six ways to Sunday\" groups will focus on anyone who threatens the system or breaks the code of Omerta.\n\nDon't read anyone else's interpretation of it; instead, read the indictment [SEE HERE].

Henry Cuellarto launder more than $200,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank, according to recently unsealed court documents that show the consultants are cooperating with the Justice Department in its case against the Laredo Democrat.\n\nCuellar, a powerful South Texas Democrat, was indicted with his wife Imelda on charges of accepting almost $600,000 in bribes from Azerbaijan and a Mexican commercial bank, Banco Azteca. The indictment, unsealed last week, accuses Cuellar of taking money from the bank in exchange for influencing the Treasury Department to work around an anti-money laundering policy that threatened the bank's interests. Cuellar allegedly recruited his former campaign manager, Colin Strother, and another consultant, Florencio \"Lencho\" Rendon, to facilitate the payments, according to court records.\n\nRendon and Strother both struck plea deals with the Justice Department in March, in which they agreed to cooperate in the agency's investigation of the Cuellars. They each face up to 20 years in prison and six-figure fines for charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe plea deals, which were first reported by the San Antonio Express-News, allege that Cuellar first asked Strother to meet with Rendon in February 2016 to \"participate in a project to test and certify a fuel additive made by a Mexican company ... so that it could be sold in the United States.\" Rendon told Strother he would pay him $11,000 a month for the project, $10,000 of which Strother would pass on to Imelda Cuellar, according to the plea agreements.\n\nRendon and Strother both struck plea deals with the Justice Department in March, in which they agreed to cooperate in the agency's investigation of the Cuellars. They each face up to 20 years in prison and six-figure fines for charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe plea deals, which were first reported by the San Antonio Express-News, allege that Cuellar first asked Strother to meet with Rendon in February 2016 to \"participate in a project to test and certify a fuel additive made by a Mexican company ... so that it could be sold in the United States.\" Rendon told Strother he would pay him $11,000 a month for the project, $10,000 of which Strother would pass on to Imelda Cuellar, according to the plea agreements.\n\nRendon paid Strother a total of $261,000 from March 2016 through June 2019, more than $236,000 of which Strother then paid to Imelda Cuellar, the documents allege. Strother concluded the project was \"a sham,\" according to his plea deal, because neither Rendon nor Imelda Cuellar \"did any legitimate work.\" Strother \"understood that the true purpose of the payments\" was to \"funnel money\" to Henry Cuellar without the Laredo Democrat having to reveal it in his annual financial disclosures.\n\nCuellar has asserted his innocence, releasing a statement Friday in which he said his actions were \"consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\" He faces charges of bribery, money laundering and working on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nCuellar, a member of Congress since 2005, has considerable influence in Washington thanks to his long tenure and his spot on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. He was the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees funding for homeland security, a position he automatically forfeited under a House Democratic rule that requires a committee chair to step down if they are indicted on a crime carrying a possible prison sentence of more than two years.\n\nAs part of their plea agreements, Rendon and Strother agreed to testify \"before a grand jury or in any other judicial or administrative proceeding when called upon to do so by the United States.\" Each also agreed to turn over \"all documents in his possession or under his control relating to all areas of inquiry and investigation.\"\n\nRendon's plea agreement also outlines the origins of the alleged bribery scheme, citing a series of 2015 meetings -- allegedly orchestrated by Cuellar -- at which Rendon and Banco Azteca executives discussed \"U.S. regulatory issues\" that were hampering the bank's efforts to \"facilitate remittances,\" or \"the transfer of money from Mexican workers in the United States to their relatives in Mexico.\"\n\nSoon after, Rendon allegedly signed a contract that would pay him $15,000 a month to provide \"strategic consulting and advising services\" for an unnamed \"U.S.-based media and television company\" that shared \"common ownership under a Mexican conglomerate\" with Banco Azteca, according to Rendon's plea documents.\n\nRendon would then send Strother $11,000 of the monthly payments, keeping $4,000 for his own consulting firm, with the understanding that Strother would keep $1,000 for himself and forward the remaining $10,000 to Imelda Cuellar's company, according to the court records. Rendon and Henry Cuellar allegedly never discussed having Rendon, Strother or Imelda Cuellar perform any work \"in relation to the contract,\" according to the plea agreement, which led Rendon to conclude that \"the contract was a sham\" and part of a scheme devised to \"funnel money\" from the bank to Henry Cuellar.\n\nIn its indictment of Henry Cuellar, the Justice Department alleged that the Laredo Democrat -- in exchange for accepting bribes -- agreed to \"advise and pressure\" officials in the executive branch to set up mechanisms that would help cross-border transactions crucial to Banco Azteca's business.\n\nHe also allegedly tipped off the bank's vice chairman about a bill that would temporarily bar the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from making new regulations on the payday lending industry. Cuellar then coordinated with a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Mexican bank on language in defense of the bill, according to the indictment. The subsidiary was a payday lending company.\n\nThe indictment said Cuellar and his wife used the bribe money to cover credit card payments, taxes, car payments, dining and shopping, including $12,000 on a custom gown. It also said one of the Cuellars' adult children assisted in the creation of the sham shell companies used to launder funds. The Cuellars have two adult children: Christy and Catie.\n\nThe Cuellars allegedly negotiated the agreement with Banco Azteca around the same time they were setting up a scheme to accept payments from Azerbaijan's state-run oil and gas company, which were also laundered through fake consulting contracts to shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, according to the indictment.\n\nIn exchange, Henry Cuellar allegedly pushed U.S. policy that favored Azerbaijan, an oil-rich former Soviet country that borders Iran and Russia on the Caspian Sea. That included adding language to defense spending legislation to prioritize ties to countries in the region, including with Azerbaijan, and working to kill legislation prioritized by members who supported Armenian interests, the indictment alleges.\n\nAzerbaijan had been engaged in a long-running border dispute with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave made up of largely ethnic Armenians, until Azerbaijan forcibly retook control of the territory last year. Cuellar coordinated with Azerbaijani diplomats to eliminate legislation that would finance land mine clearing in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2017, according to the indictment, which cited text messages between Cuellar and a diplomat.\n\nAfter news of the indictment landed, Cuellar affirmed that he still plans to seek reelection in November. Two Republicans, Navy veteran Jay Furman and rancher Lazaro Garza Jr., are facing off in a May 28 runoff to decide the GOP nominee in Cuellar's district, which stretches from the border to the San Antonio suburbs.\n\nThe Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election forecasting site, updated its rating for the district from \"likely Democratic\" to \"lean Democratic\" in response to Cuellar's indictment. Cuellar, often ranked ideologically as the most conservative Democrat in the U.S. House, won reelection in 2022 by 13 percentage points, though Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke carried the district by a narrower 5-point margin.", "source": {"uri": "keranews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KERA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar",

Henry Cuellar and a political and business consultant have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to help the Democratic congressman from Texas launder more than $200,000 in bribes and to assist prosecutors in a federal criminal investigation, according to court documents unsealed this week.\n\nFederal court records show Mina Colin Strother, Cuellar's former congressional aide, and Florencio \"Lencho\" Rendon, a political and business strategist, entered guilty pleas in March. Rendon and Strother both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, facing up to 20 years in prison and up to five years in prison, respectively, and fines. Their plea deals also guarantee their cooperation in the Justice Department's investigation into Cuellar and his wife.\n\nThe San Antonio Express-News first reported the guilty pleas.\n\nCuellar and his wife, Imelda Rios Cuellar, have been indicted on more than a dozen charges alleging they accepted close to $600,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank and an oil company owned by the government of Azerbaijan, in exchange for promoting the bank and energy company's interests. Federal prosecutors allege the bribes were laundered in the form of sham consulting contracts through front companies and middlemen into shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar. The congressman's wife, according to the indictment, \"performed little or no legitimate\" work under the consulting contracts.\n\nRead more: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/henry-cuellar-consultants-plead-guilty/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Express-News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Express-News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shell corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550970", "eventUri": "eng-9550970", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 452991331, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 23, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 23}}}

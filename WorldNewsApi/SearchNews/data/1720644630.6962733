MEN Sport understands United have held a long-established interest in the Bundesliga champion with the club holding talks with his representatives in 2023. Initially, it was thought that Frimpong would be a target for the summer of 2023 but the decision was made to defer a move thanks to Wan-Bissaka's up-turn in form. However, the Dutch right-sided player has cropped up again as Wan-Bissaka's future becomes unclear with just a year remaining on his current contract. Should they wish to sign Frimpong, he could set United back as much as \u00a331m which is significant outlay considering Sir Jim Ratcliffe is wary of Financial Fair Play (FFP) restrictions.

He told Offshore Poker Sites: \"If Jeremie Frimpong is a bit fragile defensively, then he'll be bought for a certain system by the manager. Nowadays, full-backs play much higher up the pitch and can play in all types of systems, but I don't know how Erik ten Hag wants to play. \"Man United already have a good right back in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but you can say he's the opposite of Frimpong, great defensively but not that great going forward. When we attack, we should be letting Wan-Bissaka sit back and offer more defensive protection, handling the one-on-one on the wing. \"But instead, he's told to bomb up the wing and try to take on a player, which he can't do. Erik ten Hag should take away Wan-Bissaka's attacking duties and make him defend, then they can have some solidarity in the defence. \"Instead, Wan-Bissaka, who doesn't score or create, run around like a headless chicken in the opposition box, running in his teammates' way. It's not rocket science, watching this unfold is crazy. \"The one thing you need in the defence is to be able to defend one-v-one. Just let him f****** defend.\"", "summary": "Manchester United find themselves heading into the summer transfer window counting their pennies in a bid to be compliant with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/erik-ten-hag-sent-x-29317595", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29317713.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154108381.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:04:10", "author": "Jack Flintham", "authors": ["Jack Flintham"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.104}

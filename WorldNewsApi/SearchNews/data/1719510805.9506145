{"id": 223694506, "title": "Why do all these mobile games look like my phone\u2019s UI?", "text": "It\u2019s been decades since games started implementing in-game communication devices that resemble our own real-life phones \u2014 and it\u2019s often a successful mechanic for separating and consolidating menus, as well as tracking progress. But recently, I\u2019ve noticed a weird trend: mobile games that are set entirely inside of a simulated mobile device. In other words, phone games where playing them feels like being on your phone. And frankly, I\u2019m over it. Take Guildlings, the very cute turn-based RPG. The game opens with you, a character named Coda, discovering your magical phone (also called a Tome). The phone comes with a purple fairy-like wisp that acts sort of like your avatar to move about the world \u2014 when your Tome brings you to new places in Worldaria, you\u2019ll use your wisp to control Guildlings (aka wizards) through battles and exploration. The game eventually transitions into these more complex interactions \u2014 you can move around, investigate with different items, recruit new Guildlings, and ultimately battle other wisps and wizards \u2014 but for the first 15 minutes or so, you\u2019re basically just using a text-like chat on your magical phone to make foundational decisions. It\u2019s... frustrating. And it doesn\u2019t do justice to the game\u2019s otherwise decent gameplay. This chat system carries on throughout the game, and its clunkiness probably doesn\u2019t bother most players. But my patience for my real-life phone is wearing thin, because at this point this thing is more tool and less gadget. When I play a game on it, I want to forget how annoying my phone is to use. Instead, I\u2019m often met \u2014 particularly at the outset of a game \u2014 with a UI that vaguely imitates the UI of my real phone, but with fewer decisions and less control. There are plenty of titles that successfully pull off the design of an in-game phone. Nearly every mystery game I\u2019ve played includes a phone, and it\u2019s not the most exciting part of the game, but it\u2019s often unobtrusive \u2014 you usually get notifications triggered by location or plot, and you otherwise don\u2019t need to use the faux phone. In Guildlings, the game is the phone, and for that reason, I have to really try to get into it. Moreover, it\u2019s not the only instance of a clunky phone-within-a-phone game I\u2019ve found. In-game texts in particular feel a bit tired, since this format is ostensibly a much easier way to design game conversations than animating several characters speaking to one another. An Elmwood Trail is an example of this. The game is well written and decently interesting, but it\u2019s primarily set inside faux iPhones that only give you two options for each text you send. For a game, that\u2019s predictable \u2014 but for a phone, it\u2019s extremely limiting. In the opening scenes of Elmwood, you\u2019re a detective choosing responses to send to an unknown number that\u2019s trying to blackmail you into solving a case. The conversation is fine, but it ends up being a miss for me because I don\u2019t find it fun to wait for someone to respond to my text. I also wish I could choose between more than two options \u2014 we know the technology is out there to put in our own responses and let the game digest and decide what happens next based on keywords we send (looking at you, Scribblenauts). I realize that type of game would be much more laborious to create, write, and design. But something in between the two would be wondrous. As Elmwood progresses, you\u2019ll gather other evidence to investigate, and one of the first pieces is another character\u2019s phone. This device has some impressive nuggets of detail that should be celebrated: emails that contain clues, photos of the character\u2019s cat, a Pixabowl (aka Instagram) app. But this setup falls short for me because it all so closely resembles my real-life phone that it\u2019s almost stressful. Maybe a younger audience finds this more alluring than a game without phones. Ultimately, I\u2019ve found myself wishing developers wouldn\u2019t rely so much on a watered-down version of a real-life item that can do everything to tell their stories. In Elmwood, eventually you can interact with items on your desk in addition to your device-based evidence. I don\u2019t want to punch down at this game outright, because holistically it isn\u2019t bad \u2014 but I do think there\u2019s something uninspired about using incoming texts and calls to introduce the story. Further, I think there\u2019s much more interesting commentary about phones and metagaming to be had. Reigns is an example of a game that uses elements of smartphone-like UI, but these elements are so piecemeal that the experience is still really enjoyable. Using the \u201cswipe left for no, swipe right for yes\u201d format of lots of dating apps, the game leads you through binary decisions that extend or truncate your reign as king. You can read it a bit as commentary on the way we use dating apps (er, the way you use dating apps \u2014 I\u2019m married) \u2014 don\u2019t think, just swipe. The game even prompts players to slow down and read to fully understand the implications of their decisions, which sounds like advice plenty of my friends who use dating apps could stand to internalize. There\u2019s also Honkai: Star Rail, the steamy RPG with turn-based battles \u2014 and a superpower in-game phone. The (very good, very fun) game takes place outside of the device, which is only used for communications between characters and tracking missions. Honkai accomplishes something I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere: The phone UI in this game is better than my real phone. It\u2019s faster with sleeker design and intuitive menus, along with cheeky texts that come as delightful surprises rather than obtrusive notifications. I\u2019d be a fool to think phones in games are going anywhere, and really, I don\u2019t want them to. But I\u2019m genuinely more enthused by mobile games that create a version of my phone that\u2019s more exciting than the one I use all day every day. Particularly since modern phones are lightning-fast and virtually ubiquitous, I enjoy playing games that synthesize or critique our real-life use of our smartphones rather than replicate it.", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/24158514/mobile-games-ui-guildlings-honkai-star-rail", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyCQhtBwv8A4amN5Jo9duRTFP2g=/0x251:3162x1906/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25457142/mobilegamestory.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:00", "author": "Zo\u00eb Hannah", "authors": ["Zo\u00eb Hannah"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.042}

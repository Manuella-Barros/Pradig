(AP) -- Pennsylvania will join the majority of states that ban motorists from handling a cell phone for almost any purpose while driving, as backers of the legislation hope to reduce distracted driving accidents and deaths after nearly two decades of pressing the measure.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro's office said Thursday that the Democrat will sign the bill, 18 years after he first introduced a similar bill when he served in the state House of Representatives. The ban will take effect a year after he signs it, which is expected in the coming days.\n\nThe bill also includes a provision long-sought by the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus as a bulwark against racial profiling. That provision requires bigger police departments, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police, to collect and publicly report data on traffic stops, including a driver's race.\n\nThe bill passed both chambers of the state Legislature this week and will bring Pennsylvania into alignment with the law on motorists' cell phone use in every one of its neighboring states. Currently, Pennsylvania's restriction on cell phone use while driving applies only to texting.\n\nSen. Rosemary Brown, R-Monroe, had pushed for more than a decade to toughen Pennsylvania's restriction on cell phone use while driving. Its passage is a \"monumental victory\" for Pennsylvania that will protect drivers, prevent crashes and save lives, Brown said in a statement.\n\nUnder the bill, police can ticket a driver who is handling their phone for almost any reason. Drivers can still use their phone to make phone calls or for other functions, such as listening to music, if they are using it hands-free with technology such as a docking station, Bluetooth or speakers.\n\nThe ban applies to motorists sitting in traffic or stopped at a traffic light, but does not include a driver who has parked on the side of the road or another place where the vehicle can remain stopped safely.\n\nOther exceptions include for navigational use or alerting emergency responders. A first offense is punishable by a $50 fine.\n\nShapiro called the bill \"common sense.\"\n\n\"I've met too many families that have an empty seat at the dinner table because of distracted driving. I've met too many people with injuries that they're going to live with for the rest of their lives because they were hit by a distracted motorist,\" Shapiro told WILK-FM radio in Pittston during an interview last month.\n\nCrashes where a distracted driver was a contributing factor are down in Pennsylvania in the past decade, as crashes overall have declined, according to state data.\n\nIn some years, it was the second-leading cause of accidents. In 2022, it was the third-leading cause. That was behind speed and improper turning, but ahead of drinking alcohol, careless passing and tailgating.\n\nTwenty-eight states already ban cell phone use while driving, according information from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 23 states have laws on collecting data on traffic stops, the group said.\n\nRep. Napoleon Nelson, D-Montgomery, the chair of the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, said caucus members were concerned that police could abuse a broad new power to pull over motorists and use it to target racial minorities.\n\nCaucus members viewed the traffic stop data provision as important for accountability, Nelson said.\n\n\"I think this will be a significant win for transparency and help to continue building trust between community members and those who are sworn to serve and protect,\" Nelson said in an interview.\n\nData that police must report includes the reason for the stop, details from a search of the vehicle and the race, ethnicity, age and gender of the driver who was stopped. Police forces that serve municipalities under 5,000 people are exempt from the requirement.\n\nThe data collection requirement takes effect in a year and a half. After the cell phone ban takes effect, drivers get a grace period of another year in which they only receive a written warning for violating it.\n\nOffenders who cause serious accidents could get more time in prison.\n\nIn cases where the offender is convicted of homicide by vehicle, a court can add a sentence of up to five years. In cases where the offender is convicted of aggravated assault by vehicle, a court can add a sentence of up to two years.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver

This bill is more than legislation - it is a reminder of the power of perseverance and the impact we can have when we prioritize public safety.\"\n\nDistracted driving fatalities in Pa. surged to a decade high in 2022, claiming 80 lives, according to a news release from Brown's office. The AAA Traffic Safety Culture Index found that 88% of drivers believe distracted driving has outpaced all other traffic-related issues as a growing safety concern.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)\n\nPolice officers would have the authority to stop and ticket motorists who drive while using a handheld electronic device under legislation approved in the state Senate earlier this month and the House on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesman for Gov. Josh Shapiro told the Capital-Star on Thursday that he intends to sign the bill.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania banned texting and driving in 2012, the law did not address the multitude of other uses for smartphones and similar devices. The new law would ban any use of handheld interactive wireless communication devices such as smartphones or portable computers.\n\n\"We need to make sure that it is not just texting we're trying to prevent,\" state Rep. Steven Malagari (D-Montgomery) said when the bill was considered in the state House in April.\n\n\"We're trying to prevent people from watching movies while they are driving. We're trying to prevent them from scrolling Facebook while they're driving. We're trying to prevent them from checking their emails or responding to anything else that is on their smartphone device,\" Malagari said.\n\nThe bill passed with amendments in the House and Senate with bipartisan, but not unanimous, support, as some lawmakers questioned whether such a law could effectively or fairly be enforced. The legislation was also marked by concern that it could increase racial inequities in policing by creating another reason for police to initiate traffic stops.\n\nIf Shapiro signs the bill, using handheld devices would be a primary offense, meaning police would not be required to spot another traffic violation such as speeding to charge motorists with the offense. Conviction under the new law would carry a $50 fine. The law would go into effect a year after it is signed and police would be required to issue only warnings for the first year that it is in effect, meaning it would be two years before the first tickets could be issued.\n\nSen. Rosemary Brown (R-Monroe), the prime sponsor of Senate Bill 37, championed the measure in response to a fatal crash in her district that took the life of a 21-year-old Scranton man in 2010. Paul Miller Jr. was killed by the driver of a tractor-trailer that crossed into oncoming traffic.\n\n\"Getting this bill to the finish line would not have been possible without the advocacy of Paul and Eileen Miller, the parents of Paul Miller, Jr. ... They have been with me every step of the way,\" Brown said in a statement Thursday, adding her thanks for the support of fellow lawmakers in the decade-long effort.\n\nRep. Carl Metzgar (R-Somerset) said during debate on the House floor that Pennsylvania's careless and reckless driving laws already provide the means to prosecute people for using devices while behind the wheel.\n\n\"Our job as legislators is to make laws that are applicable for all kinds of behaviors, not specific behaviors, particularly whenever it's technology,\" Metzgar said, adding that the law creates problems for law enforcement, \"because it's very difficult to determine what you are doing on that phone.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Association of Pennsylvania, which sued the Pennsylvania State Police in 2019 over alleged racial profiling, opposed the legislation.\n\n\"The elements of this offense would be nearly impossible to prove, and as such, it strains credulity to believe that violations of this offense are intended to result in convictions,\" the ACLU-PA said in a position statement. \"The only discernible function of SB 37 is a thinly veiled attempt to expand law enforcement's power to conduct and justify pretextual traffic stops.\"\n\nS.B. 37 was amended in the House Transportation Committee on March 19 to include a requirement for state and local police to report data on the reasons for traffic stops; the perceived race, ethnicity, gender, and age of drivers; and information about vehicle searches including whether the search was consensual; and whether a citation was issued as a result of the stop or search.\n\nHouse Transportation Committee Chairperson Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia), who introduced the amendment, said the language was negotiated between the sponsors, the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus, state police, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\n\n\"When everybody left that room, I gotta say nobody was smiling,\" Neilson said. \"I tell people that all the time because it's an important piece of this legislation. If one person was real happy with every part of this legislation, that means someone's hurt.\"\n\nThe ACLU noted that although more traffic stop data is badly needed, the addition of the data reporting requirement would be \"a grim twist\" because the effect of the underlying bill would be an increase in police stops, \"particularly those that target Black and Brown drivers in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nThe post Scrolling while driving will soon be a reason for Pennsylvania police to stop distracted motorists appeared first on Pennsylvania Capital-Star.", "source": {"uri":

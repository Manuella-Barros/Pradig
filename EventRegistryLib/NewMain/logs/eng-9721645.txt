Sanders commended the police for their diligence in keeping his players accountable and went a step further by offering custom Coach Prime cowboy hats to the entire squad.\n\nHistorically, the relationship between the CU campus police and the Buffaloes football team has been strained, often due to parking-related issues. Notable incidents included the booting of Shedeur Sanders' $400,000 Rolls-Royce and even Coach Prime himself receiving a parking ticket, proving that no one is above the law.\n\nHowever, Sanders chose to put the past behind him. On Monday, he praised the police for their efforts, acknowledging their role in maintaining discipline among his players.\n\nIn a post on X, the CU police department shared a photo of an officer wearing a cowboy hat, with a caption thanking Sanders for the fashion tip. Sanders responded warmly, offering to provide the entire department with custom cowboy hats.\n\n\"I need an Official Police Cowboy Hat! I can supply your entire staff with cowboy hats if needed. Let me know. The entire staff has supported our team and challenged them to do right at all times. I'm forever grateful,\" Sanders posted on X.\n\nThis gesture of goodwill marked a positive shift in the relationship between the football team and campus police. Sanders expressed his gratitude for the support from the police, both on and off the field. This interaction served as a fitting \"welcome home\" moment for Sanders, who had just returned from spending the 4th of July holiday in South Beach.\n\nAs the focus shifts back to football, the Buffaloes are gearing up for the upcoming season. Colorado aims to improve on last year's 4-8 record as they transition into the Big 12.

Sanders is one of the most popular figures in college football today, and his Buffaloes are one of the most talked about teams. Unfortunately, they aren't popular because of winning football games. That is something that Sanders is hoping to change this year now that his team has made the move to the Big 12.\n\nDeion Sanders had a lot to talk about on Wednesday. There was obviously a lot to discuss about the 2024 Colorado football team, but Sanders also touched on a more serious note: his attempted suicide.\n\nBack in 1997, Sanders attempted suicide. It still affects him every day.\n\n\"It impacts my life tremendously,\" Sanders said on Wednesday, according to an article from Action Network. \"I don't take any day for granted. I don't take anything for granted. I'm extremely blessed tremendously, being guided and led by the Lord. Not by me, not by my might, but by the Lord.\"\n\nSanders now has high expectations for every single aspect of his program. He wants his time to be successful on and off the field, and he feels like his team is judged differently than others.\n\n\"I'm judged on a different scale,\" Sanders said. \"My wins are totally different than your wins. Your wins, you just judge football. That's why I start out giving you education and academics and so forth. I have to give you those things, so you understand there's a greater scope. I can't win nine games and our GPA suffers. Our GPA can't be high and we lose another eight games. My wins are different. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged. I'm cool with that. Because we come at it a little different. So, the expectation is greater. But it's not just football. It's been like that all my life. I've always had a greater expectation for myself. The expectation you have for me would never outweigh the expectation I have for myself.\"\n\nWhile the story of his suicide is obviously a personal one, but he doesn't hide it from his Colorado team. Sanders noted that he talks to his team about everything.\n\n\"I talk to my team about everything,\" Sanders said. \"Everything. We talk about everything. I don't have to just go out and just give my team this message like -- it's whatever I'm feeling that day or whatever is in my spirit, I give it to my team. I'm talking to 100 different people, so I'm not seeing instant reactions because sometimes they engulf it in different ways. But you can't be dumb enough and stupid enough to think that out of 120-some guys, that no one's feeling that way. Somebody's always going through that. Could be a young man, it could be coaches, it could be staffers. It could be a multitude of things.\"\n\nSanders is fortunate to have survived his attempt, but he doesn't think he is lucky.\n\n\"I'm never lucky,\" Sanders said. \"God just allows me to go through things so I could see his face a little more clearer. I never doubted Him. I've never not trusted Him. I'll always trust Him. I've appreciated stuff a lot more.\"\n\nDeion Sanders understands that he has critics\n\nEven though the Colorado football hasn't found success under Deion Sanders, the program still has just as much attention as any program in the country. Some people are rooting for Sanders and the Buffaloes. Others aren't. Sanders isn't very concerned with what other people think.\n\n\"So really, I don't care how you see me,\" Sanders said. \"It's never going to be enough. Nothing I do is ever going to be enough. I'm cool with that. I understand that that is life and that's how life is going to be. But I plan on being a tremendous blessing to as many people I can bless, especially those 120 young men that put on this CU helmet and go out and play for our school and our program.\"\n\nShedeur Sanders, Deion's son, was asked about the perception of his dad. He thinks that people don't understand him because they haven't been in his position.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Shedeur Sanders said. \"People know everything, but they chose to believe what they want to. [What he says isn't] always going to hit home. You can tell somebody something, but you're not going to be able to understand that unless you're in his position or have had a lot of success.\"\n\nBig 12 commissioner Brett Yormark already feels the buzz\n\nThe Colorado football team hasn't played in a Big 12 game yet, but commissioner Brett Yormark is already seeing the impact that Deion Sanders have in terms of publicity. People want to know what is going on with Sanders and the Buffaloes.\n\n\"I love his energy and his passion,\" Yormark said. \"He's a football legend, and let's face it -- there's a big audience that follows him that's going to benefit the Big 12 and all our schools. I would look at him as someone like me. We're both a little bit disruptive in a positive way, and we like to break boundaries in a positive way. We like to stir the pot a little bit, and that's a little healthy, and I think college football needs it.\"\n\nThis season is going to be a big one for Sanders and Colorado football. It will be interesting to see if the Buffaloes can find success in the Big 12.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Yormark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Yormark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7596835966.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Shedeur Sanders was ranked as the best QB in College Football 25, the NCAA football video game coming out soon from EA Sports.\n\nDeion Sanders has not proven he is a Big 12 championship caliber football coach just yet, but one thing's for sure: he does not lack confidence in his players.\n\nSanders Talks At Big 12 Media Day\n\nSanders seemed to take offense to reporter Pete Thamel's comment that he \"plans to win this year\" at Big 12 Media Day on Wednesday, with Sanders firing back that winning should be expected.\n\nHe also had strong words for his son's talent at the quarterback position.\n\n\"Every pro team knows that he can spin it,\" Sanders said about Shedeur at the quarterback position, adding that he doesn't necessarily need to throw for 4-5,000 yards to have a successful season in Boulder.\n\nThamel brought up that Sanders mentioned both Shedeur Sanders and his star cornerback Travis Hunter could be top five picks, to which Sanders replied, \"They could be one and two.\"\n\nThe full interview was shared on Thamel's X page on Wednesday.\n\nFans React To Colorado Football Coach Sanders On X\n\nFans seemed taken aback by Coach Deion Sanders' surprising words on X.\n\n\"Which dispensary is he visiting in Colorado?\" one fan asked.\n\n\"Interviewing a coach who will win five games this year is different,\" another fan added.\n\n\"Nothing wrong with a coach hyping up his players,\" another account added.\n\nDeion Sanders' top two players will have a chance to quiet the doubters this fall as they enter the Big 12 Conference, a league that is now being seen as a far easier conference to win, especially with elite programs Texas and Oklahoma off to the SEC this year to compete with Alabama, Georgia and other top programs.",

No one's above the law!\n\nOn Monday, he not only putting the past in the past, but he commended the Colorado police for a job well done!\n\nThe department posted a photo on X showing an officer sporting a cowboy hat while standing next to his squad car. In the caption, the police thanked Coach Prime for the fashion tip.\n\nSanders responded with praise, as well as a generous offer!\n\nI need a Official Police Cowboy Hat! I Can supply your entire staff Cowboy Hats if needed. Let me know. The entire staff has supported our team & challenged them to do right at all times. I'm forever grateful.\n\n-Deion Sanders // X: @DeionSanders\n\nThe head coach thanked the police for a job well done, saying that he's \"grateful\" to have their support both on and off the field. The interaction offered the perfect \"welcome home\" moment for Sanders, who spent his 4th of July holiday in South Beach.\n\nThe attention is now turning back to football as we inch closer to August.\n\nColorado will look to best a 4-8 output from last season as they transition into the Big 12.

Last season, Sanders had 3,230 passing yards with 27 touchdowns. Hunter served as a two-way player in 2023 with 721 receiving yards, five touchdowns, 30 total tackles, two tackles for loss and three interceptions.\n\nDeion Sanders was thinking ahead at Big 12 Media Days Wednesday. He predicted that Sanders and Hunter would be the first two players selected in the 2025 NFL Draft, per On3 Sports' Andrew Graham.\n\n\"They could be one and two, based on need and desire from the league,\" Sanders said. \"They could be one and two. I don't see many flaws, if there's any flaw in their games. They don't give a darn about that, though. What they want to do is win. They want to win and they want to go out winners.\"\n\nIf it were to come true, this would be quite the feat. In program history, Colorado has only had five players taken in the top 10 of the NFL Draft. The program's highest draft pick was Bo Matthews at No. 2 in 1974.\n\nIf Sanders and Hunter go back-to-back in the draft, they would join some rarified air in Colorado program history.\n\nBefore then, Sanders and Hunter will focus on the 2024 season. Colorado's season opener is on Aug. 29, when it faces the North Dakota State Bison.\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders Names Aspect Of Colorado That Is Not Going To Change", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_bricker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Bricker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempe,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tempe, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tempe, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/21/521af41b-ad17-541b-a7e8-7efbe4897cab/668f36c60946b.image.jpg?crop=1199%2C629%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 1413, "textEnd": 1420}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Your wins, you just judge football, that's why I start out (talking about) education and academics and so forth. I have to give you those things so you understand there's a greater scope.\"\n\nSanders touted the team's GPA, the 16 Buffs coaches and staff members with NFL experience, a 20% increase in student applications to Colorado and a \"crazy\" economic impact for the school.\n\nAfter Sanders led HBCU school Jackson State to a 27-6 record over three seasons, including 23-3 with back-to-back Southwestern Athletic Conference titles the last two, he got off to a fast start at Colorado in the Pac-12, winning his first three games last season before going on to finish 4-8. Colorado was picked to finish 11th in the Big 12 preseason media poll.\n\n\"I can't win nine games and our GPA suffers,\" Sanders said. \"Our GPA can't be high and we lose another eight games. We can't not go and grab high school players, and you've got a bunch of guys in the portal, out of the portal getting incarcerated. My wins are different. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged.\"\n\nSanders' sons, senior quarterback Shedeur and graduate safety Shilo, also took part in Big 12 media days.\n\nShedeur Sanders threw for a school-record 3,230 yards with 27 touchdowns in his first season at the FBS level while completing 69% of his passes. But he was also the most-sacked quarterback (52) in the country.\n\n\"I remember first media day when I was in HBCU, I said we won't lose the game. I'm undefeated in the SWAC, so I already know what the expectation comes with, I know we're everybody's Super Bowl,\" he said. \"So, I always stay level-headed, stay grounded because I would never want to be that guy, look back, and not being able to take advantage of the moment that we have right now.\"\n\nShilo Sanders is going through a bankruptcy case he filed last October because he faces a nearly $11.9 million judgment stemming from an alleged assault against a Dallas school security guard who was trying to confiscate his phone in 2015. Shilo Sanders, now 24, was 15 at the time.\n\nThe security guard said he suffered a broken spine and nerve damage after getting elbowed in the neck. He immediately filed a police report, sued in a Texas court the next year and was awarded the judgement after Shilo Sanders didn't show up for hearings in 2022.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Honestly, that kind of stuff, you're not gonna win a court case on social media,\" Shilo Sanders said when asked about it Wednesday. \"And at the end of the day everybody is gonna know the truth about everything. So there's no point just going out of my way to just do that. So everything's good.\"\n\nDeion Sanders also spoke about Shedeur being recruited by some of his fellow Big 12 coaches -- Gus Malzahn when the current UCF coach was still at Auburn -- and the younger Sanders playing in high school for current Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire.\n\n\"I'm just highlighting a couple of the coaches because they've been so kind, they've been so considerate. They've been so wonderful to me,\" Deion Sanders said. \"I remember going there to Auburn and (Malzahn) just has been the same consistent man since. He's a phenomenal coach.\"\n\nSanders called both Mike Gundy, who is going into his 20th season at Oklahoma State, and Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark legends. He also expressed his love for McGuire.\n\n\"Joey has been the same consistent great coach that he's always been. Joey, if you out there, I love you, I appreciate you. You keep on doing what you do,\" Sanders said. \"Except when we come to play you, I want you to keep on doing your thing. But I love you, man, I really do. And you're doing a wonderful work down there at Texas Tech.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes, who open the season Aug. 29 at home against FCS power North Dakota State, play at Texas Tech on Nov. 9.\n\nThe Big 12 will be a 16-team league with Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah officially becoming members at the start of August.\n\n\"We have 16 great football coaches,\" Yormark said. \"I've gotten to know Coach Prime really well. I love his energy and I love his passion for what he does. Obviously excited for Colorado coming back into the conference. He's a football legend. And let's face it, you know, there's a big audience that follows him. And that's going to benefit the Big 12 and all of our schools.\"\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "w_g_ramirez@gazette.com", "name": "W.G.

The Big 12 is going to look a lot different this season thanks to conference realignment, and there are four new teams from the Pac-12 that are joining. One of the most notable teams making the move is the Colorado football team. Led by head coach Deion Sanders, the Buffaloes are one of the most popular teams in college football. Sanders took the podium on Wednesday to discuss his Colorado team.\n\nThe Colorado football team will once again be a team that a lot of people have their eyes on. The Buffaloes were one of the most popular teams in the country last year, but it wasn't because they were good. Colorado is hoping to change that this year, and maybe they will be able to find more success in their new conference.\n\nDeion Sanders made it clear that he is excited about this move to the Big 12. He had a lot of good things to say about some of the other coaches in the conference.\n\n\"CU coach Deion Sanders shouts out Big 12 coaches Gus Malzahn ('consistent man, phenomenal'), Mike Gundy ('a durn legend') and Joey McGuire ('great coach. I love you.'),\" Don Williams said in a tweet. \"McGuire coached Sanders' son at Cedar Hill and said Deion was the best player's dad he's ever been around.\"\n\nWhen Gus Malzahn was the coach at Auburn, he recruited Deion Sanders' son, Shedeur Sanders. Deion was a big fan of him then, and he still is.\n\n\"Much love to coach Malzahn,\" Sanders said, according to a tweet from Mitch Harper.\"...I'm just highlighting a couple of the coaches because they've been so kind. They've been so considerate, they've been so wonderful to me, and he recruited Shedeur [Sanders] out of high school. I remember going there to Auburn and he's just been the same consistent man since, he's phenomenal.\"\n\nSanders is a big fan of a lot of coaches in the Big 12, and he is also a big fan of commissioner Brett Yormark.\n\n\"I appreciate y'all, this unbelievable,\" Sanders added. \"Brett, you need to know one thing, I think we have the best commissioner in football. He's unbelievable, he's absolutely a legend. He's a baller, he's a shot-caller and he's a boss. I love it man.\"\n\nColorado football isn't trying to fit in\n\nOne thing about Deion Sanders is that he is a very unique coach. He does things differently than most coaches, and when he was asked about how Colorado football fits in to the Big 12, he said they don't, and they don't want to.\n\n\"Why would be trying to fit into anything?\" Sanders said, according to a tweet from Adam Rittenberg. \"I ain't never tried to fit into nothing ... We don't fit in, man. We fit out.\"\n\nThat is a classic Deion Sanders response right there. He runs his program in a unique way, but it doesn't matter if it works.

It's an understatement to say that police officers are currently under immense scrutiny.\n\nAcross social media and various platforms, there is a significant faction of the population that seems to relish in disparaging the police. The push to defund police departments has gained traction, further exacerbating the difficulties faced by those in uniform and the job being more demanding than it is today.\n\nMany feel abandoned by both leadership. The prevailing narrative in many circles does little to inspire confidence or trust in the system that officers are sworn to protect and serve. This backdrop of skepticism and criticism makes Sanders' stance particularly noteworthy. He has not only refrained from joining the chorus of critics but has also actively expressed his appreciation for the police.\n\nCoach Prime's recent actions underscore this support vividly. The Boulder Police department's decision to allow cowboy hats as part of their uniform is a gesture that aligns with Sanders' trademark style. This decision was met with Sanders' enthusiastic approval. In a tweet, Sanders expressed his gratitude for the police department's support of his team, highlighting their commitment to doing what is right. He even offered to provide cowboy hats for the entire CU Boulder police department, a symbolic gesture of respect.\n\nShedeur Sanders has Rolls-Royce booted by CU campus police\n\nSanders' actions reflect a broader message of appreciation for those who serve and protect, even in the face of widespread criticism. His willingness to publicly support the police at a time when it is far from popular demonstrates a commendable level of integrity and loyalty. By championing this cause, Sanders not only boosts the morale of those officers but also sets an example of leadership and gratitude for his players and the community.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolls-Royce Limited"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_133/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/buffs_beat/01j2edyxjt1vk5vw0hcb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

I'm undefeated in the SWAC. So, I already know what the expectation comes with. ... I really just always stay level-headed, stay grounded because I just would never want to be that guy who looks back and not being able to take advantage of the moment we have right now.\"\n\nColorado is coming off a 4-8 season and isn't widely viewed as one of the top contenders to win the national championship in 2024. However, UCF quarterback KJ Jefferson is using Shedeur Sanders as motivation for the upcoming season. It was revealed in a social media post this week that Jefferson's locker room has an image of him with a quote from FOX Sports' Skip Bayless that reads, \"He's not just the best QB in the Big 12 conference, but he's the best in [the] country.\"\n\n\"I was just looking for some in-house motivation to make sure that I have a competitive edge and making sure that I'm going into each situation, each day, each practice, each film study, each OTA with a competitive edge and the chip on my shoulder,\" Jefferson said. \"It just gives you that edge, that fire to make sure that you don't take anything for granted.\"\n\nShedeur Sanders was voted as the quarterback on the preseason All-Big 12 team earlier in July by the media, joining two-way star Travis Hunter and defensive lineman B.J. Green II as the three Buffs on the roster. Even though Colorado didn't have the best season in 2023, he put up impressive stats. He completed 69.3% of his passes for 3,230 yards, 27 touchdowns and three interceptions, though he was sacked a nation-high 52 times in 11 games.\n\nWith Shedeur Sanders entering the 2024 season as one of the favorites to win the Heisman and be the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, his father believes it's pretty clear what Colorado must get better at in order to improve its record.\n\n\"We got to protect that quarterback,\" Deion Sanders told reporters. \"That's No. 1.\"\n\nThe play from Colorado's offensive line in 2023 caused him to overhaul his team's offensive line and hire former NFL offensive lineman Phil Loadholt to coach the unit. The elder Sanders said that \"having the best darn quarterback in college football\" should make it easy to connect with the offensive line, adding that the offensive linemen who joined the team will \"get exposure\" playing in front of NFL scouts watching his son and Hunter.\n\n['Big Noon Conversations': Deion Sanders on future at Colorado: 'I plan on being here and being dominant here']\n\nWhile changes were made and Shedeur Sanders believes that Colorado \"is everybody's Super Bowl,\" the Buffaloes were picked to finish 11th in the Big 12 media poll earlier in July. Deion Sanders believes his team is better than that.\n\n\"I'd be an idiot to sit over here and not tell you we plan on winning,\" he said. \"I don't know who sits down and says they don't plan on winning. You [have] got to be an idiot to say that. We definitely plan on winning, and first and foremost, it starts with the staff. I think we have over 140 years of NFL experience on the staff.\n\n\"Certainly, we have two guys that are positioned to go in the top five in the draft (Shedeur Sanders and Hunter), but I think we're going to have two more that [are] going to sneak in that first round.\n\n\"Let me give you B.J.

The Buffaloes' star quarterback had a ton to address as Colorado gears up for its return season in the conference it helped found.\n\nAt the Big 12 Media Days, Sanders reflected on this year's team and addressed his expectations for the rapidly approaching 2024 season.\n\n\"This is a new team,\" Sanders said. \"Whatever happened last year doesn't have anything to do with them. It's new players, we're better at every position, we're better versions of ourselves. So you should not expect a lesser result in that.\"\n\nSanders and Colorado got off to a hot start last season, his first year as Colorado's starting quarterback. The buffaloes went 3-0 to start the year, earning a ranking in the college football top 25. However, back-to-back losses to two of the elite programs in the Pac-12 last season, Oregon and USC, started what would be a tumultuous tumble to end the year.\n\nColorado ended the year with six straight losses and went 1-8 in conference play. Although they put up a valiant fight in most of those games, Colorado could not overcome its offensive line struggles, resulting in a 4-8 finish to the year.\n\nThis year, Sanders does not expect the end of last season to follow them into 2024. Given the amount of talent Colorado has been able to acquire over the offseason, the Buffaloes quarterback prediction might be right on the nose.\n\nThe Buffaloes are going into their second season with Deion Sanders at head coach and his son Shedeur Sanders at quarterback. This comes a year after Shedeur flashed his talent but now wants to take a major step forward.\n\nAt Big 12 Media Days, Deion Sanders met with the ESPNU broadcast. There, he broke down and shared the ways that Shedeur has elevated his game this offseason.\n\n\"Work on some of the little, mechanical things,\" Deion Sanders said. \"He has a tremendous quarterback coach out of Houston. He does a wonderful job.\"\n\n\"But he works on the little things and not just the mechanics of footwork and everything and ball placement and releases, but getting to know his players, his receivers, where they want the ball. You can see in seven-on-sevens, after practice, grabbing a guy, pulling them to the side, and he's telling him what he saw.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_rudolph@on3.com", "name": "Justin Rudolph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNU", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPNU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10185911/USATSI_23715413-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

But when you peel back the layers, it's a fascinating situation when teams play Colorado.\n\nColorado created buzz as soon as Sanders' father Deion took over the program ahead of the 2023 season and despite a 4-8 season, the hype train hasn't slowed down.\n\n\"(It's) been that since day one,\" Sanders said. \"I remember(my) first media day when I was in HBCU, I said we won't lose a game. I'm undefeated in the SWAC so I already know what the expectation comes with. I know we're everybody's Super Bowl so I really just stay level headed and grounded. I would never want to be that guy to look back and not (be) able to take advantage of the moment we have right now.\"\n\nYou have to go back to when Shedeur Sanders and Colorado were 3-0 last year but were then blasted by Oregon 42-6. That's when Dan Lanning said Colorado was \"fighting for clicks and we're fighting for wins.\"\n\nIt was a clear indication that playing Colorado came with a lot of attention, deserved or not. Because of the attention Sanders and the program commanded, every single play can be critiqued.\n\nAnd of course, if you start losing, it is much easier to point fingers and rip their process. Colorado turned over a lot of the roster again, including the entire offensive line, ahead of 2024.\n\nOn paper, it looks like a better Buffaloes team with Sanders under center again. As a Heisman candidate with teammate Travis Hunter, a two-way star, Colorado will command all of that attention again, especially early.\n\nIf the Buffaloes keep winning, the stakes will only increase against each opponent in the Big 12.\n\n\"This is a new team,\" Sanders said. \"Whatever happened last year doesn't have anything to do with them.

The Hall-of-Famer confidently predicts that his team could have as many as four players selected in the first round. Among those he highlighted are his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, and two-way star Travis Hunter. Sanders has been vocal about his belief in their top-tier talent and potential.\n\n\"Certainly, we have two guys that are positioned to go in the top five in the draft (Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter), but I think we're going to have two more that's going to sneak in that first round,\" Sanders stated during the Big 12 media days via ESPN's Kyle Bonagura. This assertion showcases Sanders' confidence not just in his son and Hunter but also in the depth of talent within his team.\n\nShedeur Sanders, who has been under his father's guidance, is seen as a promising quarterback with significant potential. His development and performance have been closely watched, and his progression suggests he could be a high draft pick. Travis Hunter, known for his versatility as a two-way player, has also garnered significant attention. Hunter's ability to impact the game on both sides of the ball makes him a unique and valuable asset.\n\nDeion Sanders dubbed GOAT of the transfer portal era by rival coach\n\nIn addition to Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, Deion Sanders also mentioned edge-rusher B.J. Green. The Arizona State transfer is coming off an impressive season where he recorded 39 tackles and six sacks. His performance has caught the attention of scouts, and Sanders believes Green has the potential to make it into the first round of the draft. However, Sanders chose to keep the identity of the fourth potential first-rounder a secret, adding an element of intrigue and anticipation.\n\nThis optimism from Deion Sanders reflects his belief in the talent and preparation of his players.

Sanders finished his first season at 4-8 after a promising 3-1 start to 2023.\n\nWednesday was the first time that Sanders participated in Big 12 Media Days. Last season, Sanders attended Pac-12 Media Days. Colorado is now in the Big 12 along with the Utah Utes, Arizona Wildcats and Arizona State Sun Devils.\n\nA reporter asked the Colorado head coach how he could stay focused on winning with all the media attention his program gets. Sanders quickly remarked that the attention was not unknown to him. He said he faced it when he got to the Florida State Seminoles in 1985.\n\nSanders told reporters that while the media attention surrounding Colorado is new to them, the way he runs his program will not change. He reinforced his philosophy on the importance of coaching athletes off the field.\n\nPreparing his players for life seems to be his focus.\n\n\"So this is new to some of you all and you want us to change. We're not going to change,\" Sanders said. \"We're going to try to do things being smart, tough, fast, disciplined, with character. That's what we're relaying to all our young men. But the cameras and the lights, I think I haven't seen one kid here today that said he didn't like that.\"\n\nColorado has a ways to go after last season. The Buffaloes open the year with the North Dakota State Bison on Aug. 29. Kickoff will be at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders Projected To End One Disappointing Colorado Streak In 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_bricker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Bricker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folsom_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folsom Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/8a/98af0d62-4354-56d6-9539-bc72cad9a292/668f18ffb6bfd.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C18&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 1512, "textEnd": 1519}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

I think we have the best commissioner in football,\" Sanders said referring to Brett Yormark on Wednesday. \"He's an absolute legend, he's a boss and I love him.\"\n\nSanders went out of his way to praise a few coaches around the league as well including Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy, UCF's Gus Malzahn and Texas Tech's Joey McGuire.\n\nIt was important for the former Dallas Cowboys superstar to do that because he's felt welcomed into the league as opposed to last season, when he dealt with a few shots from coaches like Nebraska's Matt Rhule.\n\n\"I'm just highlighting a couple of the coaches because they've been so kind,\" Sanders said. \"They've been so considerate and so wonderful to me... my son Junior, he played for Coach McGuire in high school (at Cedar Hill). And Joey has been the same consistent, great coach that he's always been. If you're out there, I love you. I appreciate you.\"\n\nAfter Sanders was done with the pleasantries he went into full Coach Prime mode as he stole the show. He offered quick-witted quips, like when a reporter welcomed him to Las Vegas and Sanders responded in typical prime time fashion.\n\n\"I don't gamble though, so you ain't getting that out of me,\" Sanders said, drawing laughter from the dozens of media members present. While it wasn't bravado, it was Sanders being strongly opinionated about the outside perception of himself and the program.\n\n\"m judged on a different scale. My wins are totally different than your wins,\" Sanders declared. \"Your wins, you just judge football... I can't win nine games and our GPA suffers. Our GPA can't be high and we lose another eight games... My wins are different. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged.\n\n\"I'm cool with that. Because we come at it a little different. So the expectation is greater. But it's not just football. It's been like that all my life. I've always had a greater expectation for myself. The expectation you have for me would never outweigh the expectation I have for myself.\"\n\nSanders' mindset helped him become a Hall of Famer and one the greatest defensive backs in NFL history. The big question is if the Buffaloes can match that mindset.\n\nLast year when Colorado upset TCU in the season opener the Buffaloes started off as a Cinderella story jumping out to a 3-0 start. But Colorado went just 1-8 to close the year and all the confidence and smack talk that made them media darlings eventually led to them having a target on their back as the season progressed.\n\nNot much has changed this off-season especially when the Buffaloes were ranked in the top 20 of the new upcoming EA Sports College Football 25 game despite finishing 4-8.\n\nThe leaders of Colorado, including Shedeur and Shilo Sanders, understand that many are not expecting the Buffaloes to live up their lofty video game ranking or their frequent boasting. From Shilo's perspective, a better attitude in the locker room is giving him confidence about Colorado's 2024 outlook.\n\n\"It's not about worrying about all the outside noise,\" Shilo said. \"As a team you've got to be able to bond and not have hate toward one another. We got rid of a lot of the poison from last year and this year we're in a better space.\"\n\nShedeur, who could be first round pick, says Colorado doesn't plan on changing who it is despite last year's record.\n\n\"This is a new team so whatever happened last year doesn't have anything to do with them,\" Shedeur said. \"It's new players, we're better at every position. We're better versions of ourselves, you shouldn't expect lesser results.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes made a number of wholesale changes this off-season including hiring Robert Livingston to oversee the defense, bringing in Warren Sapp as an assistant and landing the top-ranked transfer class in the Big 12.\n\nAs much external pressure as there is on Colorado, there's more pressure internally. This feels like an all-or-nothing year for Colorado as the Sanders brothers and Travis Hunter will likely head to the NFL or run out of eligibility. In order for Colorado to really be viable for years to come, the Buffaloes need a strong debut season in a new league without the likes of USC, Oregon or Washington.\n\n\"The mindset this year is about perfection. It's about individually we've got to be the best version of ourselves,\" Shedeur said. \"This is the best year for us to do everything, this is the year for us to be legendary.\"", "source": {"uri":

Sanders started his college career with the South Carolina Gamecocks in 2019. He transferred to the Jackson State Tigers in 2021 and again to Colorado in 2023.\n\nSanders was at Colorado during the massive transfer portal exodus during the 2023 offseason. The Colorado defensive back insisted that the Buffaloes rid themselves of poison last year and are in better headspace in 2024, per ESPN's Adam Rittenberg.\n\nThe program saw more than 40 players leave Colorado during that cycle. A similar situation happened this offseason.\n\n\"As a team, you've got to be able to bond and can't have no hate toward each other,\" Sanders said. \"You can't [have] poison. We got rid of a lot of poison last year. And this year, we're in a better space, clicking as a team and we expect to win.\"\n\nHowever, the Buffaloes have yet to click as a team. Colorado finished last season 4-8. The team got off to a 3-0 start but lost traction once conference play started.\n\nIf the team starts clicking in 2024, a bowl game could be possible for the program. Colorado last played in a bowl game in 2020. The team's last bowl win was against UTEP in 2004.\n\nSanders has proved to be valuable in Colorado.

It was a disappointing end to year one with Deion Sanders as head coach. Transitioning to the Big 12, the hope is that Deion Sanders has more talent on the roster to potentially make a bigger push in 2024.\n\nIt is a big year for Colorado, as Shedeur Sanders, along with two-way star Travis Hunter and Shilo Sanders, are expected to depart for the NFL after this season. There is pressure to get as many wins as possible before those three players leave.\n\nTravis Hunter is likely to be a high draft pick mainly for his strengths as a cornerback, while the Sanders brothers need good seasons to maximize draft status. Shedeur Sanders could be a high draft pick as a quarterback with a strong season, while Shilo is not viewed as a first round prospect, but should get drafted in 2025.\n\nHow does Shedeur Sanders need to improve in 2024?\n\nThere are certain facets of Shedeur Sanders' game that need to improve, and it would be beneficial for his team and his draft status if he is able to make these adjustments. In general, Shedeur is viewed as the second best quarterback prospect in the 2025 class behind Carson Beck of Georgia, but there is a lot of time for that to change, whether it is for the good or bad.\n\nShedeur Sanders dealt with a lot of pressure in his face last season at Colorado, but still showed a lot of positives despite that. He has a propensity for making plays out of structure when the play breaks down, but that is a bit of a double edged sword, because one of his flaws is that he bails from pockets early or hold on to the ball too long, and he has acknowledged he has to improve in that area, according to Dane Brugler of The Athletic.\n\nImproving in that area will result in less missed open reads, as last season he missed a fair amount because he was looking elsewhere, or taking a sack because his eyes were focused on the pressure and not looking down field.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Shedeur Sanders improves in this area, and if he is able to maximize his draft status heading into 2025.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Hunter_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Hunter (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwestern Athletic Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Colorado-football-news-Shedeur-Sanders-vocal-on-expectations-as-Deion-Sanders-son.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

As one could imagine, many people were intrigued by Colorado's representatives, head coach Deion Sanders and his two sons, Shilo and Shedeur Sanders. Punter Mark Vassett was also there, but it was the Sanders family that most were interested in hearing from.\n\nThe head coach turned some heads, expressing just how pleased they are to be in the Big 12 and declaring their lofty goals in year two. However, it was Shedeur who may have caused the biggest social media uproar when he answered a question about being in the spotlight as the son of Deion Sanders.\n\nShedeur flashed that iconic Sanders swagger, looking back at his time at Jackson State and saying he's always been under some sort of pressure.\n\n\"It been there since day one,\" Sanders said. \"I remember my first media day when I was in HBCU. I said we won't lose a game. I'm undefeated in the SWAC, so I already know what the expectation comes with. I know we're everybody's Super Bowl... So I always stay level-headed and stay grounded because I would never want to be that guy look back and not being able to take advantage of the moment that we have right now.\"\n\nWhile many may disagree with 4-8 Colorado being anyone's Super Bowl, it is worth noting that the Buffs were one of the most-watched teams in college football last season. Even when they were struggling, they were able to draw in significant audiences.\n\nIn 2024, the Buffs are looking to reach a bowl game, and possibly make a run for the Big 12 title if all things go right. They greatly improved their roster through the transfer portal, bringing in 40+ players and they also have a new coordinator on both sides of the ball. They are expected to be must-watch again in 2024, and clearly they are well aware of this.\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders Reveals His Plan For After His Sons Leave Colorado For NFL\n\nRelated: Deion Sanders 'Mad' At AD For Scheduling FCS College Football Powerhouse", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Athletic_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwestern Athletic Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/b1/eb1d93d8-1c86-5e81-9e31-1a669f0d9398/668f49aeba4d8.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

And that overhaul arrives one year after just 10 scholarship players from 2022 returned to Sanders's squad for his debut season in '23.\n\nAs one of four Pac-12 teams joining the Big 12 this year, Colorado was picked to finish 11th out of 16 teams in the conference's official preseason poll.\n\nSanders certainly has his work cut out for him this year-no matter what expectations follow him into the season opener against North Dakota State on Aug. 29.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Deion Sanders On Pressure Colorado Faces: 'I'm Judged on a Different Scale'.", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_dierberger@bnd.com", "name": "Tom Dierberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grading in education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/grko9a/picture289948099/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/1b05083f-9cd6-4d6d-8488-65f3e6f41a4b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 1927, "textEnd": 1934}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

There are plenty of social media users and people in general who love to criticize police for no reason at all, there are movements to defund police departments and it's probably never been harder than it is right now to be a cop.\n\nDon't believe me? Go ask some of your local police officers if they feel like leadership and politicians have their back? Many will say no, and I know that because I've spoken to many officers about the topic.\n\nHowever, the Colorado football coach isn't among those interested in trashing police.\n\nThe University of Colorado police department tweeted that cowboy hats are now allowed as part of the uniform, and it's a clear nod to the school's head coach wearing one.\n\n\"The entire staff has supported our team & challenged them to do right at all times. I'm forever grateful,\" Sanders tweeted, in part, Monday when offering to get the entire CU Boulder police department cowboy hats.\n\nYou can check out the tweet below, and hit me with your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nIt's great to see a person with a platform praise the police, especially one who is leading young men. Again, it's very easy and popular to trash cops, but they have a tough job.\n\nPolice officers are required to deal with the worst of society on a daily basis.

Clearly, Deion Sanders supports his local officers, and it's awesome to see.\n\nProps to Sanders for using his platform to spread a positive message.

That meant the two tied for the best quarterback in the game, which officially releases next week and features players' name, image and likeness for the first time.\n\nBut something about Shedeur Sanders' rating didn't set well with his father, Colorado head coach Deion Sanders. Speaking on NFL Network's The Insiders after Big 12 Media Days, \"Coach Prime\" wondered how two quarterbacks could be tied for the top spot.\n\n\"How's there a tie? ... That's like, do you hate so bad that you've got to give them a tie?\" Sanders said. \"There ain't to ties in football. There ain't no ties. We don't want no tie. No. We ain't accepting no tie. Ain't no tie. Just say what it is.\"\n\nIn addition to tying for the top quarterback in EA Sports College Football 25, Shedeur Sanders came in as the No. 17 overall player in the video game, which releases July 16 to users who purchased the deluxe edition and officially comes out July 19. His famous watch celebration will also be featured.\n\nSanders is one of more than 14,000 players to opt in to the game through an NIL program with EA Sports, facilitated by OneTeam and CLC worked hand-in-hand to facilitate the NIL deals. Athletes receive $600 plus a copy of the game for their participation.\n\nSanders is generating some early Heisman Trophy and NFL Draft buzz this year, including comparisons to Seattle Seahawks standout Geno Smith. His father said he and Travis Hunter could be the top two picks in the draft as they look to continue building a connection that began when they played under Deion Sanders at Jackson State.\n\nLast year, Shedeur Sanders adjusted well to Power 5 football at Colorado. He threw for 3,320 yards, 27 touchdowns and just three interceptions in 11 games under center in 2023. Coach Prime said he's also taking his game to a new level this year, and it's already showing.\n\n\"Work on some of the little, mechanical things,\" Deion Sanders said. \"He has a tremendous quarterback coach out of Houston. He does a wonderful job.\n\n\"But he works on the little things and not just the mechanics of footwork and everything and ball placement and releases, but getting to know his players, his receivers, where they want the ball. You can see in seven-on-sevens, after practice, grabbing a guy, pulling them to the side, and he's telling him what he saw.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_schultz@on3.com", "name": "Nick Schultz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Ewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geno Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10191212/deion-sanders-shedeur.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 923, "textEnd": 930}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 998, "textEnd": 1005}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Your wins, you just judge football, that's why I start out (talking about) education and academics and so forth. I have to give you those things so you understand there's a greater scope.\"\n\nSanders touted the team's GPA, the 16 Buffs coaches and staff members with NFL experience, a 20% increase in student applications to Colorado and a \"crazy\" economic impact for the school.\n\nAfter Sanders led HBCU school Jackson State to a 27-6 record over three seasons, including 23-3 with back-to-back Southwestern Athletic Conference titles the last two, he got off to a fast start at Colorado winning his first three games last season before going on to finish 4-8. Colorado was picked to finish 11th in the Big 12 preseason media poll.\n\n\"I can't win nine games and our GPA suffers,\" Sanders said. \"Our GPA can't be high and we lose another eight games. We can't not go and grab high school players, and you've got a bunch of guys in the portal, out of the portal getting incarcerated. My wins are different. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged.\"\n\nSanders' sons, senior quarterback Shedeur and graduate safety Shilo, also took part in Big 12 media days.\n\nShedeur Sanders threw for a school-record 3,230 yards with 27 touchdowns in his first season at the FBS level while completing 69% of his passes. But he was also the most-sacked quarterback (52) in the country.\n\n\"I remember first media day when I was in HBCU, I said we won't lose the game. I'm undefeated in the SWAC, so I already know what the expectation comes with, I know we're everybody's Super Bowl,\" he said. \"So, I always stay level-headed, stay grounded because I would never want to be that guy, look back, and not being able to take advantage of the moment that we have right now.\"\n\nShilo Sanders is going through a bankruptcy case he filed last October because he faces a nearly $11.9 million judgment stemming from an alleged assault against a Dallas school security guard who was trying to confiscate his phone in 2015. Shilo Sanders, now 24, was 15 at the time.\n\nThe security guard said he suffered a broken spine and nerve damage after getting elbowed in the neck. He immediately filed a police report, sued in a Texas court the next year and was awarded the judgement after Shilo Sanders didn't show up for hearings in 2022.\n\n\"Honestly, that kind of stuff, you're not gonna win a court case on social media,\" Shilo Sanders said when asked about it Wednesday. \"And at the end of the day everybody is gonna know the truth about everything. So there's no point just going out of my way to just do that. So everything's good.\"\n\nWhile on the main podium, Deion Sanders spoke about Shedeur being recruited by Gus Malzahn when the current UCF coach was still at Auburn, and the younger Sanders playing in high school for current Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire.\n\n\"I'm just highlighting a couple of the coaches because they've been so kind, they've been so considerate. They've been so wonderful to me,\" Deion Sanders said. \"I remember going there to Auburn and (Malzahn) just has been the same consistent man since. He's a phenomenal coach.\"\n\nSanders called both Mike Gundy, who is going into his 20th season at Oklahoma State, and Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark legends. He also expressed his love for McGuire.\n\n\"Joey has been the same consistent great coach that he's always been. Joey, if you out there, I love you, I appreciate you. You keep on doing what you do,\" Sanders said. \"Except when we come to play you, I want you to keep on doing your thing. But I love you, man, I really do. And you're doing a wonderful work down there at Texas Tech.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes, who open the season Aug. 29 at home against FCS power North Dakota State, play at Texas Tech on Nov. 9.\n\nThe Big 12 will be a 16-team league with Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah officially becoming members at the start of August.\n\n\"We have 16 great football coaches,\" Yormark said. \"I've gotten to know Coach Prime really well. I love his energy and I love his passion for what he does. Obviously excited for Colorado coming back into the conference. He's a football legend. And let's face it, you know, there's a big audience that follows him. And that's going to benefit the Big 12 and all of our schools.\"\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He answered a variety of questions touching on defensive coordinator Robert Livingston, the players, the NFL experience among the Buffs' coaching staff and much more.\n\nEven though the Buffs are the new faces in the conference, they once again came in as the hottest topic throughout Tuesday and Wednesday's media days with other Big 12 coaches receiving questions regarding Sanders and his program and the media swarms around the Sanders family.\n\nInquiries regarding how the Buffs will improve this season, what the coaching staff has to offer and more were directed towards Sanders during the main press conference and he ensured that the Buffs' are ready to compete in their return to the Big 12.\n\n\"We played a total of 20 freshmen last season, including seven walk-ons,\" Sanders said. \"So if you're a freshman and you walk on, you have an opportunity to play.

It depends which way you look at it", "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Deion Sanders was notably more measured for most of his interview circuit at Allegiant Stadium on Wednesday than he was after that stunning season-opening upset of TCU last September when he walked into his postgame news conference and boisterously proclaimed, \"Do you believe??\"\n\nHowever, he did still have a security guard right behind him and a camera crew documenting his every move.\n\nAnyone who paid attention to Colorado football last year -- and it was nearly impossible not to -- remembers well the arc of Sanders' first season. After starting 3-0 and becoming the most talked-about story in sports, the Buffs got drilled 42-6 by Oregon and won just once more to finish 4-8. A whole lot of people took delight in seeing Coach Prime get humbled in such a humiliating fashion.\n\nBut Sanders characterizes his debut season more favorably.\n\n\"Look at the scores, (six of the losses) were one-possession games,\" he told The Athletic Wednesday at Big 12 media days. \"We were close, but we didn't have what we needed to get over the hump. The record was what it was, but when you're talking about progress, before we got there ...\"\n\nAt this point, he paused, thinking carefully about what he would say next. You could tell he was reticent about throwing the former CU staff and players under the bus.\n\n\"The margins of victory (the year before), that's totally different. You've got to check those.\"\n\nHe's not wrong. The Buffs' 1-11 team in 2022 was abysmal, losing 10 games by at least 25 points, including the last five by at least five touchdowns. Compared to that team, the 2023 Buffs may as well have been the school's 1990 national title team.\n\n\"It's going to take one more touchdown,\" star quarterback Shedeur Sanders said of winning close games. \"I feel like I've got one more touchdown in me after this offseason work.\"\n\nThe Sanders' version of Pops' first season is the \"glass half-full\" one.\n\nHighlighted by Shedeur, one of the top quarterback prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft, and two-way sensation Travis Hunter, Colorado ranked in the top 30 nationally in pass efficiency (149.3) in 2023. But that's about all that went right. The Buffs ranked last out of 133 FBS teams in rushing yards per attempt (2.31) and second-to-last in sacks allowed (56).\n\nAs for the defense -- not great. They finished 115th in yards per play allowed (6.27).\n\nAfter all the hype, the Buffs finished in the same place in the last-ever Pac-12 standings as they did the year before: alone in last place.\n\nThat's the \"glass half-empty\" perspective.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Deion Sanders raved about the improvement he saw this spring at nearly every position group -- particularly highlighting his largely remade staff. Speaking about DC Rob Livingston, formerly the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, Sanders said, \"I feel like we're going to kick butt, we're going to win, and he's going to be a head coach in college or pros or whatever he endeavors because he's that good.\"\n\nOn the defensive line, coached in part by former Nick Saban assistant Sal Sunseri since last season, the head coach raved about \"the way these young men are working and the athletes that they are and the bodies that they have and they developed right now.\" He called outside linebackers coach Vincent Dancy \"one of the best coaches on the whole darn staff.\"\n\nThe offense will again be led by former NFL head coach Pat Shurmur, who took over midseason last year when Sanders demoted Sean Lewis -- now the head coach at San Diego State.\n\n\"(Shurmur) is pretty darn good as well. I mean really good,\" said Sanders. \"His compatibility and his relationship with Shedeur is amazing. And what they plan to do this season, I can't wait to see it myself.\"\n\nAgain: Glass half-full.\n\nTake a closer look at that new staff, and one might notice that Livingston, who spent the past 12 seasons with the Bengals, has never been a play caller. His lone college experience was as an analyst at Furman and Vanderbilt. Or that Sunseri, 64, moved to an off-field role under Saban before Sanders came calling. Or that Sanders hired Dancy last year coming off a 10-38 stint as the head coach at Mississippi Valley State.\n\nOr that the new O-line coach, former Oklahoma and NFL tackle Phil Loadholt, has never before held an on-field coaching role. He's only charged with upgrading CU's most visible weak spot from last season.\n\nAgain: Glass half-empty.\n\nDeion did not shy away from hyperbole in talking about some of his players. He was aghast that Hunter did not receive the highest player score in the new EA Sports College Football 25 game (he was tied for second). He expressed excitement when a local reporter mentioned the Raiders might be eyeing Shedeur but said he also hoped they didn't lose enough games to draft that high. He proclaimed safety-turned-linebacker Trevor Woods \"is going to be the next Brian Urlacher,\" and suggested defensive end B.J. Green could develop into a first-rounder.\n\n\"We want four (picks) in the first round,\" said Sanders. \"The only way that's going to happen is that we win and they're dominant.\"\n\nBut it won't be a handful of high-end players that determine whether CU makes a big jump in 2024. It will come down to whether Sanders has been successful in upgrading the rest of the two-deep over the past two offseasons. The Buffs will once again trot out a lineup heavy on transfer portal pickups, though Sanders made it a point to mention that 13 high-school signees played as freshmen last season. And few players drew more praise from him than former walk-on running back Charlie Offerdahl.\n\nWith the massive hype that's accompanied the NFL Hall of Famer since he took the job, \"progress\" won't move the needle this season. Just reaching a bowl game would be a big step for any other Colorado coach, but this one was hired to make a much bigger splash -- 10 wins, conference title contention, etc.\n\nAnd with this almost certainly being the last year he has Shedeur and Hunter, it may feel like a make-or-break season already.\n\n\"I'm judged on a different scale,\" said Sanders. \"My wins are totally different than your wins.\"\n\nHow many wins will he produce in 2024?\n\nThat depends if you take the glass half-full or glass half-empty perspective.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's something that head coach Deion Sanders has noticed, pointing out that he's \"judged on a different scale,\" during Big 12 Media Days.\n\nESPN insider Heather Dinich went on Get Up. There, she shared her thoughts on Deion Sanders' comments and why Colorado is being watched differently than other programs.\n\n\"Because the lens that we view that program through was created by Deion Sanders,\" Heather Dinich said. \"It's Hollywood. There's a reason he has five million followers on his Instagram account.\"\n\n*Follow all Colorado Buffaloes news on Facebook here*\n\n\"A lot of that is the success he's had throughout his life, but everyone wants to know what's he gonna say next? What's he gonna do next? That's why everybody's paying attention to them.\"\n\nPart of what Sanders had argued about how he's judged differently was on the basis that the majority of college coaches are critiqued solely for their wins. However, he believes that in his case he's also judged on things like academics and how the team is constructed.\n\nThat's something that Dinich didn't agree with Sanders about. Instead, she argued that all schools, and not just Colorado, are judged on those things too.\n\n\"I would push back just a little bit on the different standards. Because I could tell you, there's no greater pressure than at Texas, where I sat with Steve Sarkisian in his office and he told me as his team's win total increased, so did his team's GPA. So, every college coach in the country is facing a similar standard in that they need to win, they need to get to the College Football Playoff, and they do need to have those GPAs and all those intangibles,\" Dinich said.\n\n\"But I do agree for all the reasons we just said that Colorado is viewed differently.\"\n\nComing off a four-win season, there is an expectation that Colorado will take a step forward in terms of record in 2024. However, Deion Sanders says wins won't dictate success for the team.\n\n\"Football-wise? No, no, because we're always measured differently. We would never fulfill your thought process. Just say, for instance, we go to a bowl. 'They should have won more games. They should have been in that bowl, but they gave away that lead.' You know, it's always going to be something. We know what success means to us. We'll keep that in-house,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"Who doesn't plan on winning? Is there any coach that came here that doesn't plan on winning?

When I tell you he's awesome, he's totally awesome.\"\n\nSanders had high praise for Trevor Woods, who made a change from safety to linebacker last season.\n\n\"And I really think this young man is going to be the next Brian Urlacher,\" Sanders said of the junior from Houston. \"I think he's going to make that transition from safety to linebacker and be dominant.\"\n\nSanders expressed a belief that his team will have four players selected in the first round of the NFL draft.\n\n\"I just see the want and the fire and the desire from our young men, and I can't wait for you to get the opportunity to see it as well,\" Sanders said. \"So I'm very optimistic on what we have on our plate this year.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes open Sanders' second season at home against North Dakota State on Aug. 29.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@heraldonline.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-on_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walk-on (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Zimmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Zimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Loadholt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Loadholt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_&_Mary_Tribe_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William & Mary Tribe football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Urlacher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Urlacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/9utvaa/picture289947919/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ea1df9c5-644b-4fef-a3e5-057dd7755c6f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 2607, "textEnd": 2614}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

In particular, it was a challenge for quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who flashed his talent but was behind a weak offensive line and finished the season injured.\n\nDespite that, ESPN college football insider Heather Dinich said on Get Up that Shedeur Sanders has nothing to prove. The key is to get better play around him.\n\n\"He doesn't have anything to prove,\" Heather Dinich said. \"He is great. He's accurate. He's tough. Any NFL scout that has watched him knows this. But look at those numbers. Blown block percentage 55 percent. Do you guys want to stand back there? Because I sure don't. He's got to stay on his feet and he's got to stay healthy.\"\n\n*Follow all Colorado Buffaloes news on Facebook here*\n\nShedeur Sanders finished the 2023 season with a 69.3 percent completion percentage for 3,230 yards and 27 touchdowns to only three interceptions. It was an impressive season but it also came with some major issues, like that Colorado only won four games and Sanders was injured by the end of the year.\n\nThe offensive line was widely seen as a major issue and it's not a surprise why. Colorado was 132nd out of 133 teams in terms of sacks allowed in 2023, giving up 56. That's 4.67 sacks per game. The poor offensive line play carried over into the running game, with the Buffaloes finishing 133rd in rushing offense, with 68.92 yards per game on the ground. That meant defenses were able to sit back in coverage, knowing they would be able to pin their ears back and pressure Sanders.\n\nDespite all those major issues on the offensive line, Heather Dinich thinks the team's issues went beyond it and also fell on the defense, which finished 124th in scoring defense, giving up 34.8 points per game.\n\n\"But it is more than the offensive line,\" Dinich said. \"This is a Colorado team last year that scored 30, 40 points and the defense was ranked 124th in the country in scoring defense.\"\n\nFor Deion Sanders, the focus has clearly been on improving the entire roster and offensive line play in particular this offseason. That's included a heavy dose of Transfer Portal usage to build around the stars like Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter. In fact, Colorado has brought in 41 transfers to the program.\n\nAmong those transfers, Colorado has essentially recruited an entirely new offensive line to protect Shedeur Sanders, with five offensive linemen joining from the portal alone.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_morrison@on3.com", "name": "Dan Morrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Hunter_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Hunter (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/09/12100641/Colorado-QB-Shedeur-Sanders.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

With their return to the conference comes a return to Big 12 Media Days.\n\nAt this year's event, Colorado had some of the biggest names in college football present and representing them in Las Vegas, NV. Arguably, the biggest name is none other than head coach Deion Sanders. During the Big 12 Media Days, the Colorado head coach shared his thoughts on the Buffaloes' talent heading into the 2024 season.\n\n\"Let me start off with Justin Mayers, the right guard. Tyler Brown, played for us in Jackson State, was not eligible last year,\" Sanders said. \"He will probably be starting at the left guard. Jordan Seaton is a darn five-star, and this kid is a pro, just like some of these other guys. Kahlil Benson, he's a killer. I mean, he's ready to fight right now. I'm serious. Hank (Zilinskas) is gonna probably start at the center position. I said Justin Mayers, but we have depth, as well, in that line. They probably have a collection of 10 guys that could possibly start for you.\"\n\nSome individuals probably suspected that Sanders would start with Colorado's star quarterback and his son, Shedeur Sanders when discussing the Buffaloes' talent. However, he used the moment to highlight the individuals who will be responsible for keeping the star quarterback upright and who play along the offensive line.\n\nSanders wasn't finished there. As he continued, he also highlighted the weapons that will be at Shedeur Sanders' disposal this season, particularly at wide receiver.\n\n\"Then, when you think about the receiving corps [and] what we already had, you throw in a LaJohntay Wester [and] shoot, like, come on,\" said Sanders. \"Now, you couple him with Jimmy Horn in the slot, and you got some problems. And then when we get on the outside, those guys can flat-out do it, and Shedeur has a rhythm with them, and you can see it in practice.\"\n\n\"In practice, we have several corners that are pros, I feel. And we come out the womb bumping and running. That's what we do. So, the work that we're getting right now is phenomenal, and the ball placement and what they're doing, what they're accomplishing right now, and just going back and forth with the expectation and the intensity of, even the workouts, is phenomenal. I'm proud of it.\"\n\nColorado is a trendy pick to compete for and possibly win the Big 12 title in its inaugural season. But the Buffaloes will have to do battle with the Utah Utes and Arizona Wildcats, who joined them from the Pac-12. Colorado will also have to beat out the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who have a top-ranked superstar talent on their roster, and running back Ollie Gordon.\n\nEach one of the three teams mentioned above, Sanders and the Buffaloes, will have to see on the field in 2024. However, if Colorado's talent pans out and plays through the expectations of their head coach, we could see the buffaloes representing the Big 12 as a part of this year's College Football Playoff field.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_rudolph@on3.com", "name": "Justin Rudolph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10185237/USATSI_23715290-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Your wins -- you're just judging football.\"\n\nAs they caught on with their early season hype, Coach Prime, CU quarterback Shedeur Sanders and company were criticized for acting too showy off the field, exhibiting too much swagger for little, immediate success.\n\nColorado's opponents quickly circled them on the calendar once the Buffaloes started acting gaudy, hoping to humble the headline-grabbing Sanders family.\n\nPrime declared that the target on the Buffaloes' back last season was directly aimed at him. The coach caught plenty of headlines because of his signature intensity from his playing days at Jackson State to his current position with the Buffaloes.\n\nPrime's critics could likely call him out for not taking accountability for a paltry four-win season.\n\nAny college coach responsible for a meager four wins deserves criticism.\n\nDeion added, \"That's why I have to start out and give you education and academics and so forth. I have to give you those things so you understand there's a greater scope. I can't win nine games and our GPA suffers. Our GPA can't be high but we lose another eight games. ... My wins are different.\n\n\"We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged, and I'm cool with that because we come a little different so the expectations is greater.\"\n\nIn his debut year, Sanders may not have met the sky-high expectations, but he did manage to throw CU into the limelight.\n\nAt the Big 12 Media sessions, Utah Utes head coach Kyle Whittingham credited Sanders' impact on the program in his first year as coach.\n\n\"Essentially, he's put Colorado football back on the map. Year two, I'm sure they're looking for progress. They started off very strong last year. Injuries caught up to them and didn't end the way they wanted, I'm sure.

He inherited a one-win team and quadrupled their win total in just one year, though the Buffs lost eight of their final nine games following a perfect 3-0 start.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters during the Big 12 media day at Allegiant Stadium (home of the Las Vegas Raiders), \"Prime Time\" was asked if he feels pressure \"to perform at a higher level\" based on his status.\n\n\"Yes. I'm judged on a different scale. My wins are totally different than your wins. Your wins, you're just judging football...I can't win nine games and...our GPA suffers. Our GPA can't be high, but we lose another eight games....My wins are different. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged.\"\n\nSanders added that higher expectations have been part of him throughout his life, not just football.\n\nAlso Read: Social Media Is In An Uproar Over EA Sports' Ridiculous Rankings For Deion Sanders' Colorado Buffaloes In The Upcoming College Football 25 Video Game\n\nLet's just say that fans on X/Twitter didn't buy Deion Sanders's statement about being judged differently from other coaches.\n\nThere's good reason to believe that Sanders' Buffaloes will improve considerably in year two, and not just because of experience. Deion's son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, took more sacks than any other quarterback in the country a year ago.\n\nColorado went great lengths to bolster Shedeur's pass protection, landing Matthew Bedford and Kahlil Benson from Illinois and Tyler Johnson from Illinois via the transfer portal. A healthy Travis Hunter, who missed three games last year, should also make a considerable difference in Boulder.\n\nThe Buffaloes will try to begin the 2024 season on a high note when they welcome the North Dakota State Bison on Aug. 29 (8:00 p.m. EST) in a game that will be aired on ESPN.\n\nAfter playing host to North Dakota State, the Buffaloes will travel to Nebraska with a showdown against the rival Cornhuskers on Sept. 7 (7:30 p.m. EST).

He just isn't keeping it a secret anymore.\n\nHours after the Colorado football coach took center stage at Big 12 media days, Sanders sent a public message to high school recruits who may be considering the Buffaloes.\n\n\"To whom it may concern, if you desire to come play for us, they may drop your HS (high school) rankings just because,\" Sanders posted on X Wednesday night. \"I have a friend named LuLu from Ft. Myers they did that to years ago and they're still doing it now. Fortunately we don't care about rankings.\"\n\nReading between the lines, Sanders is likely referring to prized quarterback recruit Julian Lewis.\n\nDespite being committed to USC since last summer, the Lewis-to-Colorado buzz has been building in recent weeks and Sanders 'has a real shot' of flipping of him from the Trojans, according to On3's national recruiting analyst Phillip Dukes.\n\nThe high school football star's third visit to Boulder in late June was highlighted by a photo of him being handed keys by Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Lewis' caption read: \"Could it be 'Perfect Timing'?\"\n\nBut what does all of that have to do with Deion Sanders' post?\n\nUntil this week, Lewis was a consensus five-star quarterback in the Class of 2025.\n\nLewis dropped to a four-star prospect on both On3 and 247Sports. ESPN and Rivals still have him ranked as a five-star recruit.\n\nFor comparison's sake, On3 and 247Sports now have Lewis as the 44th- and 46th-ranked player in the nation, respectively (No. 7 QB). Meanwhile, ESPN ranks him as the No. 2 player in the country (No. 2 QB). Rivals has him as the nation's top player in the 2025 class.\n\nThat's a stark difference, and the timing is even more odd.\n\nLewis hasn't played a down of football since On3 and 247Sports dropped him 20-plus spots in their rankings.\n\nIn fact, all Lewis has done (aside from showing serious interest in Sanders' program) since throwing 48 touchdowns to just two interceptions in 2023 is impress. He took home the 2024 Elite 11 pro day championship with a perfect score of 50 the week of his visit to Colorado.\n\nThat just might be the motivation behind Sanders' post, and he just might have a point.\n\nShedeur and Colorado football fans certainly thinks so.\n\n\"Y'all know what it is lol,\" Shedeur said shortly his father's comments in reply to a post that read: \"Hold up 247(Sports) just dropped JuJu 30 spots. That's crazy.\"\n\nColorado will get the last laugh, however, if Lewis ends up flipping his commitment from USC to the Buffaloes.\n\nAfter Sanders' cryptic post, it seems like just a matter of time.", "source": {"uri": "coloradoan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Coloradoan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fort_collins_coloradoan@coloradoan.com", "name": "Fort Collins Coloradoan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Reading, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Myers, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Myers, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivals.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rivals.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/11/PFTC/74361447007-usatsi-23717180.jpg?auto=webp&crop=7447,4189,x0,y388&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Picture Credits: Instagram @shedeursanders\n\nColorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders is among the Top 100 players in EA Sports' College Football 25' in terms of overall ranking. He and Georgia's Carson Beck have the highest grade among QBs with a 93, but fans can't believe he got such a high grade despite him only winning four of 12 games last season.\n\nSince wins always count in sports, Colorado's performance the previous year should affect Sanders' overall mark. After all, the best players find a way to will their team to victory.\n\nThat's why a user on X (formerly Twitter) questioned how EA Sports arrived at Sanders' ranking, saying, \"On what planet is Shedeur Sanders a 93?\"\n\nAnother comment seconded the first one, saying that Sanders doesn't deserve to be the highest-ranked quarterback.\n\nMeanwhile, another college football fan views Shedeur Sanders as overrated, especially with his team failing against nationally ranked opponents like Oregon, USC, UCLA, Oregon State, and Arizona. After winning their first three games, they've won only one of their last eight.\n\nJalen Milroe (Alabama), Jalon Daniels (Kansas), Jaxson Dart (Ole Miss), and Kaidon Salter (Liberty), in comparison, received a 90.\n\nEA Sports had Sanders ranked as the better individual talent than Carson Beck, giving him higher scores in five other categories (speed, awareness, accuracy, strength, and jump). If star power is the primary consideration, then perhaps Deion Sanders' son deserves the 93 ranking.\n\nHowever, some of these scores can be subject to further analysis because his numbers last season were not on par with Beck's, leading football fans to question his overall score\n\nLast year's stats reveal that the Georgia Bulldogs quarterback trumps Sanders in completion percentage, 72.4 to 69.3. However, Shedeur Sanders has more touchdown passes (27-24) and fewer interceptions (3-4) than Beck.\n\nThere's a good reason behind Beck's inferior stats in the passing game. Georgia had a potent 1-2 backfield punch with Daijun Edwards and Kendall Milton, who combined for 285 carries for 1,671 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns. Likewise, Beck had 116 rushing yards and four touchdowns.\n\nDespite Georgia's talented backfield, Beck had more passing yards (3,941) than Sanders (3,230). Beck's 9.5 yards per completed passing attempt is more impressive than Sanders' 7.5. Likewise, Beck collected his passing numbers in 417 attempts, 13 fewer than Sanders did last season.\n\nThese numbers and Georgia's 14-1 finish in 2023 make a baffling case for Sanders having the same College Football 25 ranking as Beck.\n\nShedeur Sanders and Carson Beck are two top candidates for the 2024 Heisman Trophy. However, even that aspect works in Beck's favor because major sportsbooks have him as the favorite to win the prestigious award.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, we know who the top 100 players in the game will be.\n\nBuffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders is a 93 overall (out of 99) and is the highest rated in the game at his position. Although technically one spot ahead of Georgia's Carson Beck, Sanders just wanted to know why he was tied with another QB.\n\nHis dad, CU coach Deion Sanders, had the same question and he also wondered why star cornerback/wide receiver Travis Hunter wasn't the highest-rated player in the entire game considering \"he's arguably the best receiver and best defensive back in college football.\"\n\nHunter was given the second-highest rating at 95 overall -- no player was higher than a 96 -- and was listed as the No. 6 player in the game and top wide receiver.\n\n\"But it's good conversation pieces and that's alright,\" Coach Prime said.\n\nCoach Prime's bold claims about Buffs roster\n\nDeion Sanders has said many times this offseason that he believes Shedeur and Hunter will both be top five picks in next year's NFL draft. He made similar claims Wednesday, saying they could even be the top two picks.\n\nBut he also raised eyebrows when he said those aren't the only first round picks on his CU roster.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to two more guys joining the two that we have that we know are going in the top five,\" Coach Prime said. \"I'll let you figure that out, but there's two more going in the first round.\"\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Green that he believes the new defensive lineman is one of those players but wouldn't reveal the other. Maybe it's another star receiver that's poised to put up big numbers this fall for the pass-heavy Buffs offense. Maybe he meant five-star freshman offensive tackle Jordan Seaton, who many believe has NFL potential.\n\nRegardless, that wasn't the only bold claim he made about his roster in Las Vegas.\n\nHe also brought up safety-turned-linebacker Trevor Woods, one of the last remaining scholarship holdovers from the previous Buffs coaching staff, even comparing him to Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher.\n\n\"I think he's going to take the transition from safety to linebacker and be dominant,\" Sanders said.\n\nGetting ready for the opener\n\nThe countdown to Aug. 28 is on.\n\nCU opens the season in prime time on the Thursday of the opening weekend of the college football season, when FCS powerhouse North Dakota State comes to Folsom Field.\n\nCoach Prime knows it won't be an easy season opener.\n\n\"I'm mad at (athletic director) Rick (George) right now for putting them on the schedule, to open up with them. Like can you give me a layup or something?\" Sanders said with a laugh.\n\nThe Bison have won nine FCS national championships since 2011 and are 5-1 against FBS opponents in that same time frame.\n\n\"Those guys are wonderful,\" Sanders said. \"Their staff has always been amongst the best. Many people have matriculated from that staff to go to higher levels. Those kids play their butts off. They play tough. They don't make many mistakes. They're accustomed to winning. They don't give a darn about being at home or on the road. That doesn't faze them whatsoever.

After finishing last season with a 4-8 record, Colorado aggressively utilized it by signing 42 transfer players.\n\nColorado got off to a strong start at 3-0 but struggled, losing eight of its last nine games. The Buffaloes also led the Power Five in sacks allowed, giving up 56. Only Old Dominion allowed more sacks in 2023.\n\nThat played a significant role in the roster overhaul leading into the 2024 season. The Buffaloes brought in nearly 10 new offensive linemen through the transfer portal and got Jordan Seaton, the highest-ranked offensive tackle from high school.\n\nThat's not the only position group the Buffaloes believe will be improved for the upcoming season. Quarterback Shedeur Sanders expressed confidence at Big 12 Media Days that every position will improve in 2024.\n\n\"This is a new team, so whatever happened last year doesn't have anything to do with them,\" Sanders said. \"It's new players, we're better at every position. We're better versions of ourselves. So, you should not expect a lesser result than that.\"\n\nThe Buffaloes hope that every position will be better this season because they are heading to a new conference. Colorado is leaving behind the Pac-12 and moving to the Big 12, and some believe the Buffaloes can win in its new conference.\n\nThe ESPN Football Power Index doesn't rate Colorado as highly as others. It predicts that Colorado will finish No. 10 in the conference. The FPI predicts that Colorado will finish with a 6-6 record, which would be an improvement and would make the Buffaloes eligible for a bowl game.\n\nAlthough Sanders feels that the roster will be much improved, many people want to see it to believe it.\n\nRelated: Skip Bayless Makes Bold Claim About Colorado's Shedeur Sanders", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaron_spor@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jaron Spor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folsom_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folsom Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dominion_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Dominion University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Bayless", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skip Bayless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/7c/47cee6fb-545d-5533-911a-5dd61b9a8520/668ff91702728.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Buffaloes were 132nd out of 133 teams in terms of sacks allowed after giving up 4.67 sacks per game. The Buffaloes were also 133rd in rushing offense, with 68.92 yards per game on the ground.\n\nThe defensive line wasn't much better. The Buffaloes were 63rd in sacks last season, with 2.25 sacks per game, and 96th in tackles for a loss with 5.42 per game. More problematic than that was the fact that Colorado struggled mightily against the run, finishing 110th in rushing defense after giving up 176.42 yards per game.\n\n\"We addressed both lines defensively and offensively,\" Sanders said. \"We need to get out after the passer. We need to be to run the football, as well as stop the run. The skill positions, we're tremendously blessed at that. The receivers, the defensive backs, the linebackers, running backs. We got some top-tier guys.\"\n\nFollowing the season, Deion Sanders and Colorado turned to the Transfer Portal to help fix both lines of scrimmage, bringing in 41 total transfers. That included plenty of offensive and defensive linemen, like Zechariah Owens and Dayon Hayes.\n\nESPN college football insider Heather Dinich went on Get Up. There, she explained that while quarterback Shedeur Sanders doesn't have anything to prove behind the offensive line, Colorado as a team around him needs to improve.\n\n\"He doesn't have anything to prove. He is great. He's accurate. He's tough. Any NFL scout that has watched him knows this. But look at those numbers. Blown block percentage 55 percent. Do you guys want to stand back there?

But Coach Prime knows another season without a bowl game won't cut it.\n\n\"I'm judged on a different scale,\" he said. \"My wins are totally different than your wins. We have to win in every area. That's the way we're judged. I'm cool with that. Because we come at it a little different. So the expectation is greater. But it's not just football. It's been like that all my life. I've always had a greater expectation for myself. The expectation you have for me would never outweigh the expectation I have for myself.\"\n\nSanders knows exactly what needs to happen for his team to have the success he desires -- he's been talking about it all offseason.\n\n\"The key this year is consistency,\" Coach Prime said. \"We gotta protect (Shedeur). We gotta be able to run the football. We gotta do some things that keeps us where we wanna be and that's ahead of the game, ahead of the curve.\"\n\nNow that the two-day event in the Entertainment Capital of the World is over, the time to stop talking and start playing football is about to begin.\n\nThis time next year, there's only one thing that will determine whether or not the Buffs are still the big story of the Big 12: winning football.\n\n\"I don't know anything else but that.

Enter CB Ebenezer \"Ben\" Bouzi, a promising talent from the same hometown as Coach Prime, Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nBouzi's potential has Coach Sanders particularly excited. \"I pick one kid from the city, the 239, Naples, Florida, or Fort Myers area, and you're my one kid,\" Sanders remarked, highlighting the special connection and promise he sees in Bouzi. If Bouzi can showcase even a fraction of Sanders' legendary skills, Colorado might have found a future star in their secondary and everyone should start sending recruits to Fort Myers to look for defensive backs.\n\nAfter a disappointing 4-8 season last year, the Buffaloes aim to turn things around. If Bouzi can quickly adapt and gel with Hunter and Shilo, they could form one of the most formidable defensive backfields in the nation. This defensive strength would provide Shedeur and the offense the opportunity to decide games and secure crucial victories.\n\nThe Buffaloes, who started 3-0 last season before faltering, will look to maintain their momentum throughout the year.

In the process, he brought in plenty of NFL experience - 159 years worth, to be exact, he said during Big 12 Media Days.\n\nBut as he continues to build the program in Boulder, \"Coach Prime\" wants to make sure he's setting his players up for success at the next level. That starts with having coaches who know what it's like, even though he's been there before, as well.\n\nWhile Sanders noted Colorado has coaches with plenty of college experience on board, he wanted to also create an NFL feel around the facility. That's why he brought in coaches such as Pat Shurmur and Robert Livingston as his new coordinators.\n\n\"I'm a pro, man,\" Sander said on NFL Network's The Insiders. \"Through thick and the thin, I'm a pro. And I think at another level - we have some tremendous college coaches on our staff. But when it comes to the coordinating and it comes to the majority of the staff, I want to be around guys that have been there, guys that have done that. Because our lights are bright, man. And I can't have guys getting big, you're getting a little sensitive, you're getting a little salty, you're getting a little afraid when the things light up over there on that sideline.\n\n\"So I like pros because we've been there, we've done that and we understand one another. That's not taking nothing against our collegiate coaches that we have on staff. But I think right now ... we have over 140-some years of pro experience on the sidelines, and that's relatable to where these young men want to go. It's hard to take somebody where you've never been.\"\n\nShurmur came on board last season as an offensive analyst and eventually took over play-calling before replacing Sean Lewis as coordinator of Colorado's high-powered offense, led by Shedeur Sanders.

And, as they shared the spotlight, the Sanders' looked comfortable answering questions for hours about the 2024 Buffaloes during Big 12 media day.\n\nOf course, the spotlight has been on the Sanders family for years, so being comfortable in this environment shouldn't be a surprise.\n\n\"I'm not new to this,\" Coach Prime said. \"Like we say in the hood, I'm true to this.\"\n\nThe comfort they all displayed, however, also stemmed from the fact that they feel good about the team CU has put together for this season.\n\nComing off a 4-8 season in Coach Prime's first year in Boulder, the Buffs are projected for an 11th-place finish in their return the Big 12. But, they believe they're better than that.\n\n\"Trust me because I was on the field and I know our team; I'm there every day,\" said Shilo Sanders, a senior safety. \"Everything that you all said we didn't do good last year, we've got better players now that are smart, that do right and play good.\n\n\"You have a better team at every position, and the returning starters are better; just do the math. I'm not trying to brag or anything. I'm not trying to predict anything. We've still got to go out there and win, but we definitely have a better chance of winning this year than last year. It's completely different and last year's record doesn't reflect this year.\"\n\nCoach Prime didn't hesitate when asked what gives him confidence that the Buffaloes can be better this season. He gave several reasons why he's confident, but it was fitting that he started with the trenches.\n\n\"When I see the offensive line and the way they train, way they work, the way they go about their job,\" he said. \"When I see the defensive line coaches and the way they're on their kids and the way they're demanding excellence, and the way these young men are working and the athletes that they are and the bodies that they have and they developed right now.\"\n\nCoach Prime also praised the work of the receivers, running backs, specialists and other areas, but leading with the offensive and defensive lines was important. Struggles up front were a big reason why CU was last in the Pac-12 with a 1-8 conference record last year.\n\nCU's issues last year went beyond the trenches, though, and Coach Prime believes a big issue has been addressed.\n\n\"We have mature young men that understands the moment and understands timing and understands now,\" he said. \"That's what we have. That's what we didn't have. We didn't have (enough) guys that believed in themselves. We didn't have guys that believed in the program, believed in the team.\n\n\"We have young men that believe they're pros. They believe that if we ball out - when we ball out - many more of us are going to get opportunities because we balled out.\"\n\nShedeur Sanders, the Buffs' star quarterback, and cornerback/receiver Travis Hunter are both projected to be among the top 10 picks in the NFL Draft next year. Shilo is confident he's going to get his named called, as do many others.\n\n\"I feel like more guys are just hungry to go to the league,\" Shilo said. \"So that's how I am. So whenever you get with like-minded players and just share the same attitude on defense, then that's what you want.\"\n\nMany of those like-minded players are new to the team this year, but the Buffs also return a significant amount of their core players from last year.\n\n\"What I feel confident in is we're all better versions of ourselves and we have new and improved players,\" Shedeur said.\n\nAt media day, the Buffs displayed the confidence and Shilo said he enjoyed telling people what he expects out of this season.

However, Coach Prime realizes that the national perspective of his team will always be that they could have done better.\n\n\"Football-wise? No, no, because we're always measured differently,\" Sanders explained in an exclusive interview with Pete Thamel at ESPN Big 12 Media Days. .\"We would never fulfill your thought process. Just say, for instance, we go to a bowl. 'They should have won more games. They should have been in that bowl, but they gave away that lead.' You know, it's always going to be something. We know what success means to us. We'll keep that in-house.\"\n\nHowever, that isn't to say that Sanders doesn't want to lead his team to victory each Saturday this fall.\n\n\"Who doesn't plan on winning?\" Sanders asked. \"Is there any coach that came here that doesn't plan on winning? Like, you said it like it was a news flash, right? You're darn right I plan on winning.\"\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook slotted Colorado's win total odds at 4.5 wins heading into the 2024 season.\n\nLed by Sanders' son, Shedeur on offense along with two-way star Travis Hunter are expected to be one of the most exciting duos in college football this season.\n\nHowever, questions across the roster remain after the Buffaloes lost many players to the NCAA transfer portal this offseason, not to mention bringing in just as many through the same means. The immense roster turnover -- made up of 85 players either coming in or out of the program via the portal -- makes it tough to gauge how this team will perform, but their schedule speaks for itself.\n\nThe Buffs will begin the 2024 college football season against North Dakota State on Thursday, Aug. 29. Non-conference matchups against Nebraska and Colorado State will follow before beginning Big 12 Conference play in Week 4 against Baylor. They will also feature matchups against Arizona, Utah, Kansas and Oklahoma State, among others throughout their first season back in their old conference.\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook has released odds for three games of Colorado's season, including the first two matchups against NDSU and Nebraska. The Buffs are 8.5-point betting favorites against their FCS foe, while Nebraska comes in as a touchdown favorite at home against Colorado. Nov. 16th's matchup against Utah sees the Buffs come in a 7.5-point underdogs as well.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barkley_truax@on3.com", "name": "Barkley Truax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AP poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baylor_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baylor Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/01/18135220/Untitled-design-7-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-29", "textStart": 1987, "textEnd": 1994}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-16", "textStart": 2564, "textEnd": 2573}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

They're really darned good,\" he said, and then joked, \"and I'm mad at (athletic director Rick George) right now for putting them on the schedule, to open up with them. Like can you give me a layup or something?\"\n\nA national semifinalist in the FCS last year, NDSU is sure to come to Boulder ready to go.\n\n\"Those kids play their butts off,\" Coach Prime said. \"They play tough.

I wasn't expecting that.\n\n\"We were only allowed three guys on stage ... But he said here's the sweater, here's the hat, you're coming up.\n\n\"It was first class.\"\n\nIn the 2024 draft year, the Predators made six draft picks including two from the Western Hockey League, which Sanders covers as an amateur scout. The Preds selected Miguel Marques from the Lethbridge Broncos 87th overall, and the 94th pick Hiroki Gojsic from the Kelowna Rockets.\n\nSanders started his scouting career in the WHL with the Prince Albert Raiders and spent 11 years in Kamloops with the Blazers, a year at Tri-Cities, three seasons coaching the Junior 'A' Trail Smoke Eaters ('96-99), and five years as scout for the Regina Pats, when he got the call to Nashville in 2004.\n\n\"It's very rare to stay with one team for that long,\" said Sanders. \"I was lucky, we were stable. With David Poile there, he was a very loyal guy, as long as we did a good job, and I felt like we did a good job. We provided a lot of western kids in the last 20 years.\"\n\nOver the years, Sanders has been responsible for bringing highend talent like Seth Jones, Colton Sissons, Tanner Jeannot, Tanner Molendyk and many more to Nashville.\n\nCountless hours on the road and in hotels takes its toll, but Sanders says the most satisfying aspect of the job was the time spent with young emerging players, and in watching their progress to the professional level, and beyond.\n\nOne of his final tasks as NHL Scout was helping Trail native Jake Lucchini sign a contract with Nashville and their AHL affiliate Milwaukee Admirals. Lucchini, a former Smoke Eaters captain, was in limbo after playing 40 games with the Minnesota Wild, so a chance meeting with Sanders this summer sealed a two-year, two-way deal with Nashville.\n\n\"We've been touting Jake for a while, but could never get the money to work, so I have been pushing them for the last three years,\" said Sanders. \"So this year we got it to work.\"\n\nUnderstandably, the highlight of Sanders time in Nashville was the Preds 2017 run to the Stanley Cup Final where they fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. The organization flew all their staff to each and every game to share in the incredible accomplishment of the 16th seed becoming a Stanley Cup finalist.\n\n\"Going to the Stanley Cup finals, that was so much fun. I was flying back and forth from Spokane to Nashville, we never missed a game. Again, they just treated us like royalty, the city was on fire, it was just so much fun.\"\n\nNashville too will miss their longtime scout.\n\n\"He's not only a good scout, he's just a good human being,\" Predators Chief Amateur Scout Tom Nolan said in a release. \"He's fun to be around, and he knows the Western Hockey League inside and out, because he's done every job in the Western League... He's just a good person and a great scout.\"\n\nSanders was also inducted to the Home of Champions monument in Trail in 2019, and is poised, along with 44 other scouts, to be honoured at last for their hard work and devotion to the game and its culture.\n\nThe newly formed Western Canada Professional Hockey Scouts Foundation is set to induct 45 inaugural members to their Wall of Honour at a special unveiling banquet on July 30 in Okotoks, Ab.\n\n\"I was very shocked to get the phone call from them,\" added Sanders. \"We are recognizing some of the older guys and those who have passed on, and I'm lucky enough to be in the next batch of members.\n\n\"So its' pretty special.\"", "source": {"uri": "trailtimes.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trail Daily Times"}, "authors": [],

Pat Shurmur is a communicator. Pat Shurmur is a guy that's relational that, once you get to know him, once he builds that relationship, you gonna want to play for him, you gonna want to hunt for him, you gonna want to kill for him. So he's that type of guy and the relationship that he has with Shedeur, and understanding that what both of them want to accomplish on the field is poetry in motion. And then, it's easy to communicate with him. ... A pro understands the running game and how important the running game is. So, Pat is bringing a tremendous amount of experience and success to the table.\"\n\nShedeur Sanders will certainly be a major part of Colorado's offensive effort in 2024. However, an improved rushing effort could put the Buffaloes over the hump in their first year back in the Big 12 Conference.\n\nLast season, no offensive player tallied more than 330 yards on the ground for Colorado. Sanders rushed the ball 111 times, but 52 of those were recorded sacks giving him -77 yards on the season. Instead, the leading rusher was freshman Dylan Edwards, who scored one touchdown across 321 yards on the ground. Anthony Hankerson was right behind him with 319.\n\nJoining Deion Sanders' staff in Boulder last offseason, Shurmer is a long-time coach with over 30 years of coaching experience. However, Colorado is not his first stop at the collegiate level, as he spent his first 11 years coaching at Michigan State and a lone season at Stanford.\n\nOver his 21-year NFL coaching career, Shurmur has had two head coaching stops with the Cleveland Browns 2011-2012 and the New York Giants 2018-2019. He has also been a part of eight playoff teams and six division titles. He also has a Super Bowl appearance to his name as an assistant with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2004. He'll look to mirror his NFL successes this season on the Colorado sideline.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barkley_truax@on3.com", "name": "Barkley Truax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Shurmur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Shurmur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNU", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPNU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/07/10212543/Pat-Shurmur.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721645", "eventUri": "eng-9721645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

I don't know who wrote that.\"\n\nPreparing for his senior season, Sanders said he would be ready when the Buffs open preseason practices later this month.\n\nIn fact, he believes he's a better player than last year, when he had 67 tackles, four forced fumbles and an interception that he returned 80 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\"Believe it or not, I think snowboarding has actually made me faster,\" he said, referring to one of his favorite recreational activities. \"I came back in the spring, I was doing conditioning and finishing first and stuff, I'm like, 'Dang!'\"\n\nHis brother, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, laughed when Shilo said snowboarding made a difference, but Shilo said, \"I feel like you're balancing on your toes and it gets those calves right. I don't know what it was.\"\n\nThere's been mental improvement, too, he said, as he's learned a lot from new defensive coordinator/safeties coach Robert Livingston.\n\n\"He's a pro coach that just came from the Bengals,\" Shilo said. \"You want to go to the league, you want to be coached by NFL coaches. That's what we have in-house. Having a guy that knows what it's going to take, he's been around safeties that make a lot of money, that have accomplished my dreams. Just having him guide me to that next level is great.\"\n\nNot so easy opener\n\nCU opens the season on Aug. 29 against North Dakota State, from the FCS level. NDSU isn't like other FCS teams, though. The Bison have been a national power for years, with a history of upsetting FBS teams.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBuffs head coach Deion Sanders knows it won't be an easy win.\n\n\"They're good. They're really darned good,\" he said, and then joked, \"and I'm mad at (athletic director Rick George) right now for putting them on the schedule, to open up with them. Like can you give me a layup or something?\"\n\nA national semifinalist in the FCS last year, NDSU is sure to come to Boulder ready to go.\n\n\"Those kids play their butts off,\" Coach Prime said. \"They play tough. They don't make many mistakes. They're accustomed to winning. They don't give a darn about being at home or on the road. That doesn't faze them whatsoever.\"\n\nSold out\n\nCU announced on Wednesday that its game at Folsom Field on Oct. 26 against Cincinnati has been sold out. That game is being held on Family Weekend, which often brings good attendance.\n\nSeason tickets are sold out, but single-game tickets for the other five home games are still available.\n\n(c)2024

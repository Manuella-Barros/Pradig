He signed with New Orleans back in 2020, playing in 12 games before receiving a three-year extension the next offseason. He did also take a pay cut earlier this offseason, reducing his salary cap hit down to $2.97 million and making his retirement easier for the Saints' accountants to manage.\n\nThis retirement leaves the Saints in a difficult situation on the eve of the 2024 draft, as they were already pretty weak along the offensive line. Now with the news of Ryan Ramczyk dealing with a potential long-term injury recovery with his knee surgery, the Saints are going to need to focus heavily on restocking the position in the NFL draft.

Right tackle Ryan Ramczyk is battling knee issues that leaves his training camp status and potentially his season in doubt, left tackle Trevor Penning lost his starting role just five games into the season, and former left tackle/left guard Andrus Peat was not re-signed in free agency.\n\nThe Saints have the 14th overall pick in the draft, with a heavy need for an offensive tackle following the departures of Peat and Hurst.\n\n\"I think it's a good year for offensive players,\" Saints general manager Mickey Loomis said of the draft on Tuesday. \"That's probably the way I'd put it -- a little better offensively than defensively. ... I think everyone would say that the offensive line is a position of strength in this draft, and wide receivers. There's players at every position. It's just a matter of how we look at them vs. some of these other clubs.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Ramczyk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Ramczyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrus_Peat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrus Peat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Loomis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Loomis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1015%2Fr1238845_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509961", "eventUri": "eng-9509961", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Even though he has a strong career as a Tar Heel, Hurst went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft, but proved that he, in fact, belonged in the league.\n\nThe former Tar Heel signed with the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent, as he worked his way into a starters role for the 2017 season. He was mostly a reserve as a member of the Ravens, but did gain his fair share of opportunities to start.\n\nHe went on to sign with the New Orleans Saints and became a key contributor, as he was a full-time starter in each of the last three seasons. Now, at the age of 32, Hurst has decided that it's time to hang up his cleats and retire from the sport he's played for his entire life.\n\nHeading into the NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints were one of many teams in need of offensive line help. Now with Hurst's retirement, that need is even bigger, as there's an additional hole the Saints must fill before the start of the 2024 season.\n\nAsk any front office executive in the NFL, and they'll tell you how difficult that is to do.\n\nHurst put together a very solid career, especially given that he didn't hear his name called during the 2014 NFL Draft.

We ended the season very positively and that does a ton for the next season.\"\n\nHurst later notes that the offensive line recognized their failures after multiple poor showings and understood that they \"did not play well enough to help the team win the game.\" The numbers agree with Hursts' sentiment about starting poorly and ending strongly. Quarterback Derek Carr was sacked 19 times in the first eight games of the season and only 12 times in the final nine games.\n\nHurst also appears to have confidence in Carr and claims that his former OL teammates trust Carr's abilities.\n\n\"We have a quarterback that we know is a player and that we know can get the job done and score points for us,\" Hurst noted of Carr. \"It's no surprise to the offensive line that a ton of our offensive success will come from how the offensive line plays.\"\n\nHurst has optimism for the younger members of the offensive line, including Trevor Penning and Nick Saldiveri. He notes that new offensive line coach John Benton could be huge for Penning specifically.\n\n\"Trevor is so physically talented,\" Hurst added. \"With a young guy that's unproven - who knows what happens when he gets a new offensive line coach? Coach (Benton) might come in and say something that breaks it wide open for Trevor.\"\n\nHurst played ten seasons in the NFL, four of which came as a Saint.

about Hajj facilities.\n\n\"We are in the process of compiling these complaints, although no doubt that issues were faced by pilgrims confirmed by our team on the spot, \" he said.\n\nThe official explained,\"From the time the pilgrims leave the buildings for departure to Mina on the night of 7th Zilhijja to the night they return to their buildings on 12th and 13th Zilhijja, all arrangements and control of their movement are taken over by various agencies, departments of Saudi government and service provider companies.\"\n\nThe Pakistan Hajj Mission's role, he added, was limited to coordinating with them and report them any inconvenience faced by the pilgrims.\n\nFor any complaint in Mashair (Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifa), the Saudi government also widely publicised helpline 1966 on which a pilgrim could call if proper services were not provided, the official said.\n\nHe was of the view that the Pakistan Hajj Mission's Moavineen, Medical and Support staff were deployed in Mashair in shifts, who assisted the pilgrims as far as possible in a crowd of over two million, and there were various video and other evidences in that regard.\n\nThe official said the Mashair area was tightly regulated that \"the buses even cover the distance of 20 minutes in 4 to 6 hours, as the overall objective of Saudi government is to minimize causalities\".\n\n\"Once the Mashair is over the complaints registered by the pilgrims shall be analysed to take up the matter with the Tawaffa company and Saudi government for their redressal,\" he added.\n\nThe official said in Hajj every year such complaints are lodged by the Pakistani pilgrims but also those of the the top ten pilgrimage countries.\n\nHe said during Mashair days the Pakistan Hajj Mission remained in contact with the Tawaffa company and Saudi Hajj Ministry for pointing out inconveniences to the Hujjaj especially in the situation when mercury touched almost 50 degree Centigrade.\n\nThe official said last year the number of Pakistanis died during Mashir days was 12 whereas during the current year, overall 35 deaths were reported so far, including nine Pakistanis.\n\nThere are around more than 25 different Saudi

He further reported that 20 Pakistani pilgrims died in Makkah and six in Madina.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Religious Affairs stated that the extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius, made this Hajj particularly challenging.\n\nHe dismissed social media allegations of abandoning pilgrims as baseless, emphasising their reliance on information provided by the Saudi authorities, which they subsequently verify.\n\nThe spokesperson explained that they are notified of any pilgrim's death. The Saudi government has a system in place where they seek formal consent from the families for burial. The body is then washed, and funeral prayers are offered in the holy sites before burial, or arrangements are made to transport the body to Pakistan as per the family's wishes.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs also noted the cooperation of the Saudi government in these matters.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has expressed sorrow over the deaths of pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the PM Office, the prime minister prayed for patience and strength for the bereaved families of the deceased pilgrims.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz contacted Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain, and Pakistan's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Farooq, regarding the current situation of the pilgrims in Makkah.\n\nThe prime minister directed that arrangements be made to transport the bodies of the deceased pilgrims to Pakistan.

This includes 20 in Makkah, six in Madina, four in Mina, three in Arafat and two in Muzdalifah, the Dawn newspaper quoted Soomro as saying.\n\nHe said the Saudi government had set up a system for burials in Haramain, and arrangements were made to send the body of any Pakistani pilgrim back to the home country if the heirs demanded so.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not officially provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone.\n\nSoomro also asked the general public not to heed social media posts about the hardships faced by the pilgrims, calling them \"inauthentic\".\n\nIn a statement issued in Islamabad, Soomro referred to a video clip circulating on social media that showed bodies lying on footpaths and people appealing to officials -- also seen in the video -- to put the bodies into the ambulances parked nearby.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that some videos are circulating on social media websites in which pilgrims are shown, and no one is coming to help [them]; these videos are baseless because their authenticity could not be verified, and their date or year could not be determined,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed out that verified information had to come from the Saudi government, which was later verified by the mission.\n\nWhile deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year's gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures.\n\nHaj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar, and this year, it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \"stoning of the devil\" ritual between certain hours due to high temperatures.\n\nAccording to the Dawn newspaper, more than 900 deaths were reported this year.

The death toll from this year's Hajj has exceeded 1,000, an AFP tally said on Thursday, more than half of them unregistered worshippers who performed the pilgrimage in extreme heat.\n\nFatalities have been reported by Egypt, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq. Director General of Pakistan's Hajj Mission Abdul Wahab Soomro said that as of 4pm on June 18, a total of 35 Pakistani deaths had been reported -- 20 in Makkah, six in Madina, four in Mina, three in Arafat, and two in Muzdalifah.\n\n\"Due to a temperature of 50\u00b0C, this was a tough Hajj,\" the official said. Soomro also dismissed social media claims of leaving the pilgrims \"helpless\". \"We trust the Saudi government's information and we confirm it ourselves as well, whenever there's a death. We are informed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry added that under the Saudi government's rules, they seek permission from the heirs of the family for burial. \"After bathing [the body], funeral prayers are offered here and burial takes place in Saudi Arabia.\" In case the family wants the body back, it said, arrangements are made to send it to Pakistan.\n\nMedia reports suggest that friends and family of missing Hajj pilgrims are searching hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once. Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFor the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. Indonesia, which had around 240,000 pilgrims, raised its death toll to 183, according to the ministry of religious affairs, compared with 313 deaths recorded last year. Deaths have also been confirmed by Malaysia, India, Jordan, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, Sudan and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. In many cases, authorities have not specified the cause.\n\nMeanwhile, friends and family members have been searching for pilgrims who are still missing. On Wednesday, they scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst during the scorching temperatures. Two diplomats told AFP on Thursday that Saudi authorities had begun the burial process for dead pilgrims, which involves cleaning up the bodies, putting them in white burial cloth and taking them to be interred in individual graves.\n\n\"The burial is done by the Saudi authorities. They have their own system so we just follow that,\" said one diplomat, who pointed out that his country was working to notify loved ones of the dead as best it could. The other diplomat said that given the number of fatalities, it would be impossible to notify many families ahead of time, especially in Egypt which accounts for so many of the dead.\n\nSaudi Arabia has not provided information on fatalities, though it reported more than 2,700 cases of \"heat exhaustion\" on Sunday alone. Last year, various countries reported more than 300 deaths during the Haj, mostly Indonesians. The timing of the Haj moves back about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, meaning that next year it will take place earlier in June, potentially in cooler conditions.\n\nA 2019 study by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change, heat stress for Haj pilgrims will exceed the \"extreme danger threshold\" from 2047 to 2052 and 2079 to 2086, \"with increasing frequency and intensity as the century progresses\".", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Friends and family searched for missing Hajj pilgrims on Wednesday as the death toll at the annual rituals, which were carried out in scorching heat, surged past 900.\n\nRelatives scoured hospitals and pleaded online for news, fearing the worst after temperatures hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) in Makkah, Islam's holiest city, on Monday.\n\nAbout 1.8 million people from all over the world, many old and infirm, took part in the days-long, mostly outdoor pilgrimage, held this year during the oven-like Saudi summer.\n\nFacebook and other social media networks have been flooded with pictures of the missing and requests for information.\n\nMeanwhile, post-Hajjj flight operation to bring back over 86000 Pakistani Hujjaj under government scheme from Saudi Arabia will begin today (Thursday).\n\nThe Hujjaj will be provided five liter Zamzam water at the airport.The flight operation will culminate on 20th of next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani Ministry of Religious Affairs on Wednesday urged the masses to disregard rumours about Hajj pilgrims and verify information from credible sources before sharing it on social media platforms.\n\nThe statement came in response to various reports and videos that purportedly showed some Pakistani pilgrims had been left stranded while performing rituals in Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah during the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nAbdul Wahab Soomro, Director-General of the Pakistan Hajj Mission (PHM), said the videos shared online were \"baseless\" and their authenticity could not be confirmed.\n\n\"The PHM relies on information provided by the Saudi government, which is later verified by the mission itself,\" the official said in a statement.\n\n\"As of 4 PM on June 18, a total of 9 deaths of Pakistanis had occurred in Mashair, with 4 in Mina, 3 in Arafat, and 2 in Muzdalifah,\" he said, adding that this year's Hajj was challenging due to extreme heat and harsh weather conditions, with temperatures reaching 50\u00b0C.\n\nSoomro emphasized the mission received reports of deaths and verified them before taking any action.\n\n\"The Saudi government has set up a system for burials and funeral prayers in Haramain, and arrangements are also made to send the dead body of a pilgrim to Pakistan if the heirs demand it,\" he added.\n\nPilgrims pelted the Jamarat and performed the Farewell Tawaf on Tuesday, bringing this year's Hajj to a close.\n\nPakistan had a Hajj quota of 179,210 pilgrims this year, of which more than 70,000 people performed the pilgrimage under the government scheme, while the rest used private tour operators.\n\nThe South Asian country will begin its post-Hajj flight operation on Thursday to bring local pilgrims back home.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

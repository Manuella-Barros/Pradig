What to know", "body": "The June 20 game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field will also serve as a tribute to baseball legend and Alabama native Willie Mays.\n\nThe historic site of Major League Baseball's special regular-season game on June 20 isn't a mythical cornfield dreamed up by a Hollywood screenwriter.\n\nIt's an actual field of dreams that has featured flesh-and-blood baseball heroes from Satchel Paige to Willie Mays.\n\nBirmingham, Alabama's Rickwood Field will be a central character when MLB honors the Negro Leagues and the legendary Mays, who died June 18 at age 93, with a nationally televised game that also celebrates the rich history of America's oldest ballpark.\n\nThe Negro Leagues were multiple leagues that featured Black players for half of the 20th century because they were banned from playing Major League Baseball until Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947.\n\n\"We really hope that young people learn about these players in the Negro Leagues that didn't earn a lot of money but loved the game,\" April Brown, MLB's senior vice president of social responsibility and community affairs, told Craig Melvin on TODAY on June 18. \"They changed the game in many ways. The game that we see on the field today is a product of that.\"\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThe National League regular-season contest will feature the San Francisco Giants against the St. Louis Cardinals in a game at 7:15 p.m. ET on June 20 that will be shown nationally on Fox.\n\nThe Cardinals will be wearing the uniforms of the St. Louis Stars, a Negro Leagues team, while the Giants will wear San Francisco Sea Lions jerseys in honor of a Negro Leagues team that played in the city in the 1940s.\n\nHall of Famer Willie Mays will be celebrated as the baseball world continues to mourn the loss of an all-time great.\n\nMays was a native of Westfield, Alabama, near where Rickwood Field is located in Birmingham. He also began his professional career playing in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for the Birmingham Black Barons when he was 17 years old.\n\nThe center fielder signed with the Giants in 1950 and went on to become a baseball icon with 24 All-Star selections, 3,293 hits, 660 home runs, a World Series title and two Most Valuable Player awards.\n\nMays had told the San Francisco Chronicle on June 17 that he would not be attending the game at Rickwood Field in person.\n\n\"I'm not able to get to Birmingham this year but will follow the game back here in the Bay Area,\" Mays said in a statement. \"My heart will be with all of you who are honoring the Negro League ballplayers, who should always be remembered, including all my teammates on the Black Barons. I wanted to thank Major League Baseball, the Giants, the Cardinals and all the fans who'll be at Rickwood or watching the game. It'll be a special day, and I hope the kids will enjoy it and be inspired by it.\"\n\nA revered part of Mays' legacy will be in the building. The plaque honoring Mays at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, will leave the museum for the first time since his enshrinement in 1979 to be viewed at Rickwood Field.\n\nThe plaque will be part of a display in a specially created fan plaza for the game that will include Negro Leagues photos and memorabilia provided by Friends of Rickwood and the Negro Southern League Museum.\n\nAnother player being honored is Bill Greason, who was the first Black pitcher in St. Louis Cardinals history. Greason, 99, is a longtime reverend who was a teammate of Mays on the Black Barons before he made history with the Cardinals.\n\n\"We hope that young people learn about this history, Birmingham being the center of civil rights, and that there were Negro Leagues players who had dreams to just play this game that they loved and that they were able to do it right here,\" Brown told Craig Melvin on TODAY.\n\nThe 114-year-old field in Birmingham is the oldest professional baseball stadium in America, according to its website. In comparison, the oldest MLB ballpark is Boston's iconic Fenway Park, which opened in 1912.\n\nFinanced by millionaire Birmingham industrialist A.H. \"Rick\" Woodward, the park was christened with a game in 1910 between the Birmingham Barons and the Montgomery Climbers in front of an estimated 10,000 fans, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe park would serve as a home to the minor league Barons and the Negro Leagues' Black Barons.\n\nA \"who's who\" of baseball legends have played at the park over the years. Of the 351 members elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, 181 of them have either played, managed, umpired or led a team at Rickwood Field over the years, according to MLB.com.\n\n\"It's a shrine. It is a baseball cathedral,\" Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick told NBC St. Louis affiliate KSDK. \"So much baseball history has been made at that park, and a lot of it was associated with the Negro Leagues. One team in particular, the Birmingham Black Barons, who shared that stadium with their white counterparts, the Birmingham Barons. And in a deeply segregated Birmingham, a Bull Connor segregated Birmingham, the Black Barons were the toast of the town. They actually outdrew their white counterparts in their own ballpark.\"\n\nNotable players who showed off their talents at Rickwood include Mays, Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio. MLB stars often played at Rickwood Field before they headed back north from spring training in Florida every year, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe field also still sees regular use. Three Birmingham high schools, Miles College and youth baseball tournaments regularly call Rickwood Field home, according to Sports Business Journal.\n\nThe field also appeared in the 2013 movie \"42,\" starring the late Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, according to AL.com.\n\nThe city of Birmingham spent $4.5 million to help renovate the stadium, according to Sports Business Journal.\n\nThose involved in the renovation leveled out the crowned playing field and installed new grass, shortened the backstop area, replaced the dugouts, installed new foul poles and reshaped the park's dimensions, which originally measured a whopping 478 feet to center field, per Sports Business Journal. It's now 400 feet to center field.\n\nThe stadium aesthetic will also feature advertisements made to resemble those in Rickwood's mid-20th-century heyday, concession stands with menu boards mimicking those from the 1940s, plus the original ticket booths. Fans can also tour the original clubhouses, and a 1947 tour bus typically used during barnstorming tours by Negro Leagues teams will be on display.\n\nThe ticketed-seating capacity for the Giants-Cardinals game will be about 8,300.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nThe game meant to honor Mays and many other Negro Leaguers will be both somber and reminiscent. Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"", "source":

What to know", "body": "The historic site of Major League Baseball's special regular-season game on June 20 isn't a mythical cornfield dreamed up by a Hollywood screenwriter.\n\nIt's an actual field of dreams that has featured flesh-and-blood baseball heroes from Satchel Paige to Willie Mays.\n\nBirmingham, Alabama's Rickwood Field will be a central character when MLB honors the Negro Leagues and the legendary Mays, who died June 18 at age 93, with a nationally televised game that also celebrates the rich history of America's oldest ballpark.\n\nThe Negro Leagues were multiple leagues that featured Black players for half of the 20th century because they were banned from playing Major League Baseball until Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947.\n\n\"We really hope that young people learn about these players in the Negro Leagues that didn't earn a lot of money but loved the game,\" April Brown, MLB's senior vice president of social responsibility and community affairs, told Craig Melvin on TODAY on June 18. \"They changed the game in many ways. The game that we see on the field today is a product of that.\"\n\nThe Cardinals will be wearing the uniforms of the St. Louis Stars, a Negro Leagues team, while the Giants will wear San Francisco Sea Lions jerseys in honor of a Negro Leagues team that played in the city in the 1940s.\n\nHall of Famer Willie Mays will be celebrated as the baseball world continues to mourn the loss of an all-time great.\n\nMays was a native of Westfield, Alabama, near where Rickwood Field is located in Birmingham. He also began his professional career playing in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for the Birmingham Black Barons when he was 17 years old.\n\nThe center fielder signed with the Giants in 1950 and went on to become a baseball icon with 24 All-Star selections, 3,293 hits, 660 home runs, a World Series title and two Most Valuable Player awards.\n\nMays had told the San Francisco Chronicle on June 17 that he would not be attending the game at Rickwood Field in person. He died a day later at 93.\n\n\"I'm not able to get to Birmingham this year but will follow the game back here in the Bay Area,\" Mays said in a statement. \"My heart will be with all of you who are honoring the Negro League ballplayers, who should always be remembered, including all my teammates on the Black Barons. I wanted to thank Major League Baseball, the Giants, the Cardinals and all the fans who'll be at Rickwood or watching the game. It'll be a special day, and I hope the kids will enjoy it and be inspired by it.\"\n\nA revered part of Mays' legacy will be in the building. The plaque honoring Mays at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, will leave the museum for the first time since his enshrinement in 1979 to be viewed at Rickwood Field.\n\nThe plaque will be part of a display in a specially created fan plaza for the game that will include Negro Leagues photos and memorabilia provided by Friends of Rickwood and the Negro Southern League Museum.\n\nAnother player being honored is Bill Greason, who was the first Black pitcher in St. Louis Cardinals history. Greason, 99, is a longtime reverend who was a teammate of Mays on the Black Barons before he made history with the Cardinals.\n\n\"We hope that young people learn about this history, Birmingham being the center of civil rights, and that there were Negro Leagues players who had dreams to just play this game that they loved and that they were able to do it right here,\" Brown told Craig Melvin on TODAY.\n\nThe 114-year-old field in Birmingham is the oldest professional baseball stadium in America, according to its website. In comparison, the oldest MLB ballpark is Boston's iconic Fenway Park, which opened in 1912.\n\nFinanced by millionaire Birmingham industrialist A.H. \"Rick\" Woodward, the park was christened with a game in 1910 between the Birmingham Barons and the Montgomery Climbers in front of an estimated 10,000 fans, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe park would serve as a home to the minor league Barons and the Negro Leagues' Black Barons.\n\nA \"who's who\" of baseball legends have played at the park over the years. Of the 351 members elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, 181 of them have either played, managed, umpired or led a team at Rickwood Field over the years, according to MLB.com.\n\n\"It's a shrine. It is a baseball cathedral,\" Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick told NBC St. Louis affiliate KSDK. \"So much baseball history has been made at that park, and a lot of it was associated with the Negro Leagues. One team in particular, the Birmingham Black Barons, who shared that stadium with their white counterparts, the Birmingham Barons. And in a deeply segregated Birmingham, a Bull Connor segregated Birmingham, the Black Barons were the toast of the town. They actually outdrew their white counterparts in their own ballpark.\"\n\nNotable players who showed off their talents at Rickwood include Mays, Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio. MLB stars often played at Rickwood Field before they headed back north from spring training in Florida every year, according to MLB.com.\n\nThe field also still sees regular use. Three Birmingham high schools, Miles College and youth baseball tournaments regularly call Rickwood Field home, according to Sports Business Journal.\n\nThe field also appeared in the 2013 movie \"42,\" starring the late Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, according to AL.com.\n\nThe city of Birmingham spent $4.5 million to help renovate the stadium, according to Sports Business Journal.\n\nThose involved in the renovation leveled out the crowned playing field and installed new grass, shortened the backstop area, replaced the dugouts, installed new foul poles and reshaped the park's dimensions, which originally measured a whopping 478 feet to center field, per Sports Business Journal. It's now 400 feet to center field.\n\nThe stadium aesthetic will also feature advertisements made to resemble those in Rickwood's mid-20th-century heyday, concession stands with menu boards mimicking those from the 1940s, plus the original ticket booths. Fans can also tour the original clubhouses, and a 1947 tour bus typically used during barnstorming tours by Negro Leagues teams will be on display.\n\nThe ticketed-seating capacity for the Giants-Cardinals game will be about 8,300.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game today between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants.\n\nThe game meant to honor Mays and many other Negro Leaguers will be both somber and reminiscent. Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday, a day after announcing he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nRickwood Field -- a landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50 percent of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Ala.?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"", "source":

MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nAn antique chair, formally used inside Rickwood Field, was put into a storage area, Monday, June 10, 2024, in Birmingham, Ala.

Here is what to know about the game.\n\nThe game will be aired on Fox on Thursday night, with a first pitch scheduled for 7:15 p.m. Eastern time. It will be played in Birmingham, Alabama. It is one of several special games the MLB hosts throughout the regular season, including the London games and the Field of Dreams game in previous years.\n\nRickwood Field is the oldest standing professional baseball park and was the home of the Negro League's Birmingham Black Barons from 1924 until 1960. The ballpark will have a capacity of 8,300 for the Giants-Cardinals game.\n\nThe historic ballpark recently received a roughly $5 million renovation to update the field while also keeping the charm of the ballpark intact. Updates to the ballpark include new padded outfield walls, new dugouts, a digital scoreboard, and accessibility improvement, according to the MLB.\n\nThe game was already slated to have tributes to Negro League and MLB greats like Mays, but with his recent death at 93, there will be an emphasized focus on the all-time great ball player.\n\nMays played for the Black Barons in 1948, helping them reach the Negro League World Series at the age of 17, before joining the MLB's New York Giants -- which later moved to San Francisco in 1958 with Mays on the team. While with the Giants, the \"Say Hey Kid\" made \"the catch\" in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, which Mays and the Giants would win in four games.\n\nWhen the MLB announced the special game at Rickwood Field last year, Mays told MLB.com it was \"emotional\" to hear that the Giants and Cardinals would play at the ballpark where he got his professional start.\n\n\"I can't believe it. I never thought I'd see in my lifetime a Major League Baseball game being played on the very field where I played baseball as a teenager,\" Mays said in 2023.\n\n\"It has been 75 years since I played for the Birmingham Black Barons at Rickwood Field, and to learn that my Giants and the Cardinals will play a game there and honor the legacy of the Negro Leagues and all those who came before them is really emotional for me. We can't forget what got us here, and that was the Negro Leagues for so many of us,\" he added.\n\nGiants manager Bob Melvin told MLB.com recently that he believes his Giants are the \"perfect team\" to play at Rickwood and honor Mays's legacy.\n\n\"He probably inspired me to play baseball and like it as much as I did,\" Melvin said. \"I was a huge Willie Mays fan. For us to be able to go to Rickwood and celebrate that game where he played and all that's involved now with the Negro Leagues and the stats being incorporated, I think we're the perfect team to go there.\"\n\nA pregame ceremony on Thursday will honor Mays's legacy on the baseball diamond and beyond.\n\nIn recent years, the MLB has increasingly celebrated the Negro Leagues, which saw iconic players such as Mays, Hank Aaron, and Satchel Paige, among others. The Negro Leagues grew in popularity and produced top-tier talent, as black players were barred from the MLB.\n\nWhen the MLB began racial integration, beginning with Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in 1947 with his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Negro Leagues began to wane in popularity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nLast month, the MLB updated its record books to include the statistics of 2,300 Negro League players after it proclaimed in 2020 that the Negro Leagues were at major league level.\n\nAs part of the tributes to the Negro Leagues at the game on Thursday, the Giants and Cardinals will be wearing uniforms of Negro League teams from San Francisco and St. Louis. The Giants will wear the uniforms in honor of the San Francisco Sea Lions, while the Cardinals will wear uniforms honoring the St. Louis Stars.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

The event will now take place two days after the passing of Willie Mays, who began his professional career at the stadium with the Birmingham Barons.\n\nDontrelle Willis, who will contribute to the on-site pregame show, and for whom the opportunity has special meaning, spoke to Sports Illustrated about the one-of-a-kind assignment.\n\nSI: What are you most excited about?\n\nDW: Really just taking in the legacy of the ballpark. To take in all the stories and gain knowledge on who played there, when did they play there, seeing all the memorabilia, seeing the field surface as well. Just to be a patron and enjoy the vibe of the city and the ballpark and what it means.\n\nSI: It also feels like this is a tremendous opportunity for a history lesson for fans. How are you approaching that?\n\nDW: It's one of those things where it's like there's no Dontrelle Willis without the men and women who sacrificed at this ballpark. It's a cathedral of African American baseball. And it's not just baseball history, it's really United States history. Having the ballpark be a historical landmark, you know, it's truly remarkable. Even as an African American I didn't know much about the ballpark until recently. It's just cool to go out there and hear about Willie Mays being there as a teenager. It's unreal stories and unreal ballplayers. From Buck O'Neil to Satchel Paige - these are people who are legacy in this sport. Between the Negro Leagues and this event right now it's really about time that these men and women got their flowers.\n\nSI: When you get to the Major Leagues and you've been there for a few years there has to be a point where everything begins to feel routine. How would you be approaching this experience if you were still playing? Are things like this a chance to recalibrate and reconsider what the game means to you?\n\nDW: You have no choice but to do that because it's not just about you and your routine. These events, like the Field of Dreams game that Fox did a wonderful job with, the World Series, when you're in them you feel so small because you realize it's bigger than you. And that's the cool thing about it. That's what brings the excitement, you know? There's a lot of people in this world that don't even get a chance to learn history let alone be a part of it in an event like this so it's going to be exciting no matter what your background is.\n\nSI: I'm thinking about how the Negro Leagues were contextualized in the overall baseball picture even back when you were playing compared to now and wondering if there's any part of you that's surprised Major League Baseball is doing this game?\n\nDW: I think that they realized it was about time to tell that story. You can't tell the story of baseball in its entirety if you hold out the Negro Leagues. You really have to look yourself in the mirror. You can't tell the whole legacy of the game. All the players we know and love today, they don't get a chance if the Negro Leagues weren't around. Look at all the stars in our league now. The game is alive and well because it's welcome to all.\n\nSI: And this is coming on the heels of Negro League statistics being added to MLB's official record books.\n\nDW: It's always been these wonderful stories like Satchel Paige throwing a doubleheader by himself of Josh Gibson being the true home run king. When you have historical facts, and the Negro Leagues and Bob Kendrick whose done a wonderful job over there continuing to grow, you really have to address it head-on. This is a beautiful byproduct of that. So absolutely, man. It's about damn time. Super excited to be at the field. As a Black Ace, it's a lot to take in because it's like if these people hadn't done this I don't know where my life would be. I'm incredibly indebted, I can't pay them back. How I pay them back is just by listening and enjoying.\n\nSI: Are you anticipating being emotional when you're there?\n\nDW: Absolutely. Because of what I just said. I know my family, growing up in Oakland, my grandfather was my hero because all he talked about was baseball. All he talked about was loving the game. We lived a couple of exits away from the A's stadium so I was one of the few children blessed to be able to just walk down the street to the ballgame. The Negro Leagues back in the day really instilled that love in my grandfather that moved through the rest of my family. My mom played softball, my grandma loved the game. If I don't have that seed planted in me, I don't know where I would be and I don't know where my family would be. My grandfather's not here anymore but I know he's smiling down on me once I'm able to get back to Birmingham.\n\nSI: You talked about listening and enjoying but I would also say that something you seem mindful of is the idea of paying it forward. How does that thought land on you?\n\nDW: There's a responsibility. Guys like Dave Stewart planted that seed and understood the responsibility to pay it forward. It transcends monetary value. You want the world to be a better place and this is how you teach it, by understanding the historical factors and the importance of telling the story the right way. There's a lot of guys in the big leagues now who say that I'm their favorite player. If you're an African American player, and being a Black Ace, yeah I feel a responsibility so when I talk to the Triston McKenzies of the world or Marcus Stroman, the first thing out of their mouth is they want to be a Black Ace. That's the coolest thing in the world. For me to be in the same group as CC Sabathia and Bob Gibson and guys like that, it's like are you kidding me? At the same time, it's wonderful. So that's how you pay it forward because you never want to be the last one. You're seeing the uptick now of African Americans really getting intrigued by the game so I think this is definitely going to push it forward.\n\nSI: Finally, what are you anticipating the crowd and atmosphere to be like?\n\nDW: I think the vibe is going to be fun. I think it's going to have a lot of positivity around it. It's going to be very intimate because the grounds are very intimate so I think that's going to be fun. I think there's going to be a lot of energy outside the stadium where people are selling things, you know? It's just going to be fun. It's going to remind us of and give a type of Negro League feel. It's going to be exciting and it's going to bring the best out of players. They love the uniforms, they're learning the history and they're learning the importance of going out there and putting on the best show. Like they were doing it in the Negro Leagues - they were showmen. They came to provide joy for a couple of hours.\n\nCoverage begins at 5:30 p.m. live from Birmingham as the San Francisco Giants get ready to face the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThis article was

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Burton) among stars in FCA All-Star Game Follow the yellow brick road to the Gilliam Stage this summer\n\nThe game meant to honor Mays and many other Negro Leaguers will be both somber and reminiscent. Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nRickwood Field -- a landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century.Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-today upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nBe the first

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nA landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century.Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games. \"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the allwhite Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement

These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nSports Week

The event will now take place two days after the passing of Willie Mays, who began his professional career at the stadium with the Birmingham Barons.\n\nDontrelle Willis, who will contribute to the on-site pregame show, and for whom the opportunity has special meaning, spoke to Sports Illustrated about the one-of-a-kind assignment.\n\nSI: What are you most excited about?\n\nDW: Really just taking in the legacy of the ballpark. To take in all the stories and gain knowledge on who played there, when did they play there, seeing all the memorabilia, seeing the field surface as well. Just to be a patron and enjoy the vibe of the city and the ballpark and what it means.\n\nSI: It also feels like this is a tremendous opportunity for a history lesson for fans. How are you approaching that?\n\nDW: It's one of those things where it's like there's no Dontrelle Willis without the men and women who sacrificed at this ballpark. It's a cathedral of African American baseball. And it's not just baseball history, it's really United States history. Having the ballpark be a historical landmark, you know, it's truly remarkable. Even as an African American I didn't know much about the ballpark until recently. It's just cool to go out there and hear about Willie Mays being there as a teenager. It's unreal stories and unreal ballplayers. From Buck O'Neil to Satchel Paige -- these are people who are legacy in this sport. Between the Negro Leagues and this event right now it's really about time that these men and women got their flowers.\n\nSI: When you get to the Major Leagues and you've been there for a few years there has to be a point where everything begins to feel routine. How would you be approaching this experience if you were still playing? Are things like this a chance to recalibrate and reconsider what the game means to you?\n\nDW: You have no choice but to do that because it's not just about you and your routine. These events, like the Field of Dreams game that Fox did a wonderful job with, the World Series, when you're in them you feel so small because you realize it's bigger than you. And that's the cool thing about it. That's what brings the excitement, you know? There's a lot of people in this world that don't even get a chance to learn history let alone be a part of it in an event like this so it's going to be exciting no matter what your background is.\n\nSI: I'm thinking about how the Negro Leagues were contextualized in the overall baseball picture even back when you were playing compared to now and wondering if there's any part of you that's surprised Major League Baseball is doing this game?\n\nDW: I think that they realized it was about time to tell that story. You can't tell the story of baseball in its entirety if you hold out the Negro Leagues. You really have to look yourself in the mirror. You can't tell the whole legacy of the game. All the players we know and love today, they don't get a chance if the Negro Leagues weren't around. Look at all the stars in our league now. The game is alive and well because it's welcome to all.\n\nSI: And this is coming on the heels of Negro League statistics being added to MLB's official record books.\n\nDW: It's always been these wonderful stories like Satchel Paige throwing a doubleheader by himself of Josh Gibson being the true home run king. When you have historical facts, and the Negro Leagues and Bob Kendrick whose done a wonderful job over there continuing to grow, you really have to address it head-on. This is a beautiful byproduct of that. So absolutely, man. It's about damn time. Super excited to be at the field. As a Black Ace, it's a lot to take in because it's like if these people hadn't done this I don't know where my life would be. I'm incredibly indebted, I can't pay them back. How I pay them back is just by listening and enjoying.\n\nSI: Are you anticipating being emotional when you're there?\n\nDW: Absolutely. Because of what I just said. I know my family, growing up in Oakland, my grandfather was my hero because all he talked about was baseball. All he talked about was loving the game. We lived a couple of exits away from the A's stadium so I was one of the few children blessed to be able to just walk down the street to the ballgame. The Negro Leagues back in the day really instilled that love in my grandfather that moved through the rest of my family. My mom played softball, my grandma loved the game. If I don't have that seed planted in me, I don't know where I would be and I don't know where my family would be. My grandfather's not here anymore but I know he's smiling down on me once I'm able to get back to Birmingham.\n\nSI: You talked about listening and enjoying but I would also say that something you seem mindful of is the idea of paying it forward. How does that thought land on you?\n\nDW: There's a responsibility. Guys like Dave Stewart planted that seed and understood the responsibility to pay it forward. It transcends monetary value. You want the world to be a better place and this is how you teach it, by understanding the historical factors and the importance of telling the story the right way. There's a lot of guys in the big leagues now who say that I'm their favorite player. If you're an African American player, and being a Black Ace, yeah I feel a responsibility so when I talk to the Triston McKenzies of the world or Marcus Stroman, the first thing out of their mouth is they want to be a Black Ace. That's the coolest thing in the world. For me to be in the same group as CC Sabathia and Bob Gibson and guys like that, it's like are you kidding me? At the same time, it's wonderful. So that's how you pay it forward because you never want to be the last one. You're seeing the uptick now of African Americans really getting intrigued by the game so I think this is definitely going to push it forward.\n\nSI: Finally, what are you anticipating the crowd and atmosphere to be like?\n\nDW: I think the vibe is going to be fun. I think it's going to have a lot of positivity around it. It's going to be very intimate because the grounds are very intimate so I think that's going to be fun. I think there's going to be a lot of energy outside the stadium where people are selling things, you know? It's just going to be fun. It's going to remind us of and give a type of Negro League feel. It's going to be exciting and it's going to bring the best out of players. They love the uniforms, they're learning the history and they're learning the importance of going out there and putting on the best show. Like they were doing it in the Negro Leagues -- they were showmen. They came to provide joy for a couple of hours.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dontrelle_Willis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dontrelle Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pre-game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_O'Neil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buck O'Neil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satchel_Paige", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satchel Paige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_at_Field_of_Dreams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB at Field of Dreams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Stewart (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_Sabathia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CC Sabathia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stroman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stroman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1094,h_615,x_0,y_61/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01j0rb1yz9tqb1vpew27.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Commemorative MLB game to honor Negro Leagues in wake of Willie Mays' death", "body": "Bob Nightengale and Steve Gardner talk about who the big buyers in the MLB trade market are this season, and what players they are considering.\n\nRickwood Field is one of the United States' most historic ballparks and sports landmarks.\n\nIts history is centered around players like Willie Mays and Satchel Paige getting their start in the Negro Leagues to later living their dream of playing professional baseball -- one that Jackie Robison, who too played at Rickwood -- put in play in 1947 when he broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball.\n\nNow, the nation's oldest ballpark will see its history renewed while paying an ode to the Negro Leagues in a unique way Thursday when the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals travel to Birmingham, Alabama for a special single regular season game Thursday night.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Where was Willie Mays from? Late MLB legend was Alabama native who began career in Birmingham\n\nHere's what you need to know about why MLB has returned to Birmingham and Rickwood Field for a special commemorative game Thursday:\n\nWhy is MLB, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals playing at Rickwood Field?\n\nThe Giants and the Cardinals are playing at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama on Thursday, June 20 as part of the MLB's first commemorative MLB at Rickwood Field: A Tribute to the Negro Leagues game.\n\nThat isn't the only piece of history being made Thursday. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal, Thursday's NL Central vs. NL West clash between the Cardinals and the Giants will have the first ever all-Black umpiring crew in MLB history. Alan Porter will be behind the dish while Adrian Johnson, C.B. Bucknor, Jeremie Rehak and Malachi Moore will make up the rest of the crew on the bases and replay center.\n\nMLB announced the addition of the game to its \"special event games\" -- like the MLB Little League Classic, Field of Dreams Game and London Series amongst others -- in June of 2023. According to MLB.com, the field had $5 million worth of renovations put into it to bring it up to MLB regulation and ready for the game.\n\nOpened on August 18, 1910 Rickwood Field is the oldest ballpark in the United States and one of five Negro League ballparks that still remains standing today, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. At 114 years young, Rickwood Field is older than both Fenway Park and Wrigley Field.\n\nAs previously reported by The Tuscaloosa News, Rickwood Field was a \"passion project\" for Birmingham industrialist Allen Harvey \"Rick\" Woodward. The field itself, which was modeled after the Pittsburgh Pirates old Forbes Field, was the first minor league ballpark to be built with concrete and steel.\n\nThe first team to play at Rickwood Field was the Birmingham Barons, until the Birmingham Black Barons, formerly the Birmingham Stars of the Negro Southern League, started playing there in 1920. The Black Barons were formed as the Barons were not allowed to play Black teams at that time, nor allowed to have Black players.\n\nThe Black Barons, who played at Rickwood Field when the Barons were on the road, moved up to the Negro National League in 1924, which according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame was a \"major league caliber\" league. In 1927, the Black Barons won the Negro National League second-half pennant, thanks to a then young Satchel Paige.\n\nThe Black Barons played at Rickwood Field until 1960, shortly before the Negro Leagues folded as a whole. The Black Barons were quite successful in the 1940s, winning three Negro American League pennants in 1943, 1944 and 1948. MLB teams also played spring training games at Rickwood Field during this time, as they made their way back to their MLB city from Florida. This is how players like Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb and Stan Musial added their names of players to have played at Rickwood Field.\n\nOne of the reasons the Black Barons, and later the Barons, stopped playing at Rickwood Field in 1961 was due to race and segregation issues that involved Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan. Baseball would return to Rickwood Field in 1967 when the then-Kansas City Athletics brought its Double-A affiliate to Birmingham, where they stayed until 1975. Since then the Detroit Tigers (1981-1986), who also brought back the \"Barons\" name, and Chicago White Sox (1986-present) would have their Double-A affiliates play in Birmingham and Rickwood Field.\n\nNote: When the White Sox returned to Birmingham in 2013, after playing at Hoover Met Stadium from 1988-2012, they moved to Regions Field.\n\nPlayers to have played at Rickwood Field\n\nThe list of former MLB players to have played at Rickwood Field -- either in the Negros Leagues or MLB or both -- is quite legendary. According to MLB.com, 181 Hall of Famers have either played or managed at Rickwood Field over the years.\n\nWhile Hank Aaron, \"Mr. Cub\" Ernie Banks, Paige and Robinson are on that list, perhaps the most famous player to ever play at Rickwood Field is Birmingham's own, the late Willie \"SayHey\" Mays, who played three seasons for the Birmingham Black Barons before signing with the then-New York

The evening and its planned celebrations will take on a little bit more of a somber note in the wake of Mays' death.\n\nHere's why Rickwood Field was so important to Mays and the history of baseball.\n\nWhy Rickwood Field is so special\n\nHaving been open since 1910, no baseball stadium likely holds as much influence and gravitas as Rickwood Field. In the early parts of the 20th century, the Birmingham Barons of the Negro Leagues played on the field. They later changed their name to the Birmingham Black Barons and remained as such from 1924 to 1960.\n\nEven when the Negro Leagues disbanded in 1948 after MLB integrated Black players, Rickwood Field remained an essential fixture in Birmingham and the greater baseball community. It is officially part of the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nSome of the most famous Black players in baseball history have played at Rickwood Field during intermittent stints with the Black Barons. With Mays obviously included, the list notably also features:\n\nJackie Robinson Satchel Paige Josh Gibson Ernie Banks Hank Aaron\n\nNeedless to say, these are genuinely some of the biggest heavy-hitters baseball has ever seen.\n\nWhy is MLB having a game at Rickwood Field?\n\nThe answer is simple. Given the importance of the Negro Leagues to baseball's history, growth, and the black mark of segregation, MLB has started embracing its imprint much more, most recently announcing plans to incorporate Negro Leagues statistics into the official MLB record books.\n\nBefore his death, Mays was set to be honored individually on Thursday night. The Alabama native played a season at Rickwood Field with the Black Barons when he was 17 years old before officially jumping to the MLB, where he spent the majority of his career with the Giants.\n\nShortly before his death, Mays issued a formal statement that he would unfortunately not be in attendance on Thursday:\n\n\"I wish I could come out to Rickwood Field this week to be with you all and enjoy that field with my friends. Rickwood's been part of my life for all of my life. Since I was a kid. It was just 'around the corner there' from Fairfield [the town where Mays went to high school], and it felt like it had been there forever. Like a church. The first big thing I ever put my mind to was to play at Rickwood Field. It wasn't a dream. It was something I was going to do. I was going to work hard to be one of the Birmingham Black Barons and play ball at Rickwood Field. That's what I did. It was my start. My first job. You never forget that. Rickwood Field is where I played my first home game, and playing there was IT -- everything I wanted.\"\n\nA pregame ceremony will pay tribute to the baseball icon in the wake of Mays' death. The Giants and Cardinals will wear unique uniforms representative of Negro Leagues teams from San Francisco and St. Louis to commemorate the occasion.\n\nWilli Castro got bizarrely tripped up by his

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nA landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\n0 Comments",

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCar struck by train Saturday in Davenport after driving around crossing gate IN MEMORY: Steve Tappa, 1966-2024 Water main break closes intersection in Village of East Davenport until next week Kobe Sushi and Hibachi opens in Davenport Apartment building in Davenport given order to vacate YMCA of the Iowa Mississippi Valley reacts to possible loss of North Family building Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants Clinton man sentenced to 255 years in prison for sexually abusing, prostituting and extorting girls Davenport man arrested for allegedly possessing child porn Angel Reese says Caitlin Clark gets 'special whistle.'

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nA landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nSports Week

The Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates used the ballpark as a spring training site in the early 1900s.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner were among the legends who came through. However, for many, fans got to see the talent of the Negro Leagues, including Willie Mays, who got his start with the Black Barons at the age of 17.\n\nMays, who passed away this week at 93, told the San Francisco Chronicle that playing in the majors was not something he thought he could attain - at least not until Jackie Robinson first broke the color barrier in baseball, and Larry Doby followed him in the American League.\n\nREAD: On The Night Willie Mays Passed Away, It Was Fitting That Baseball Was Being Played At Rickwood Field\n\nMays got his start with the New York Giants in 1951 and was the Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" he told the paper before his death. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nThursday night's game was set to honor Mays, who before his death announced he could not make the trip to Alabama.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nRickwood Field was also noted for its play in American Civil Rights history.\n\nIt was one of the sites of marches for voting rights and boycotts, but on the end, brutal beatings, civil unrest and bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" comedian Roy Wood Jr. told The Associated Press. \"... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nRickwood's head groundskeeper, Jabreil Weir, helped MLB get the facility ready to host a game.\n\nSome of the renovations included a new drainage system and backstop netting.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir told The Associated Press. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event?

He was standing outside a small museum underneath the stands, where the next day fans would line up to see Mays' flower-draped Hall of Fame plaque, the first time it has left the wall in Cooperstown since it was installed at his induction in 1979. \"I have chill bumps. I can't think of any place to be than here.\"\n\nAt 114 years old, Rickwood Field is the nation's oldest professional ballpark, the first place Mays played pro ball and the last ballpark still standing that he called home. To honor the legacy of the Negro Leagues, Major League Baseball scheduled a game in Mays' hometown between the San Francisco Giants, Mays' old team, and the St. Louis Cardinals, that will be played on Thursday.\n\nThe Rev. William H. Greason, 99, who was the first Black pitcher for the Cardinals in the 1950s, has been a pastor in Birmingham for more than a half-century since retiring from baseball. He had been hoping to see his old friend this week, at the ballpark where they played together.\n\nIn 1948, Greason was a star pitcher for the Black Barons, baffling hitters with three types of curveballs, and Mays was a teenage star from a local high school who had dazzled on the sandlots, playing for industrial league teams fielded by the steel mills and coal mines. Greason became a mentor to the young Mays, and they won a league championship together and played in the last Negro World Series.\n\n\"We were good friends, and both of us just starting, it was easy for us to get along,\" Greason said.\n\nMajor League Baseball's tagline for the week, plastered on signs around the city, is \"A Tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" but it has been as much a celebration of Mays' singular life and legacy, now amplified with his death.\n\nThe Birmingham Civil Rights Institute this week unveiled an art installation of a towering Willie Mays baseball card. And on Monday evening, the marquee of the Carver Theater, once one of the few places Black people could see first-run movies during the time of Jim Crow, was lit up with Mays' name, for a screening of the 2022 documentary, \"Say Hey, Willie Mays!\"\n\nAfter the screening, Mays' son, Michael, told the audience that his father could not make it to Birmingham. \"He wants to be here bad,\" he said, adding, \"I think deep down what it is, is he don't show up halfway.\"\n\nWillie Mays issued a statement Monday evening to The San Francisco Chronicle, saying he was too unwell to travel, and reminiscing about Rickwood Field, describing it as \"like a church.\"\n\n\"The first big thing I ever put in my mind was to play at Rickwood Field,\" he said. \"It wasn't a dream. It was something I was going to do.\"\n\nRickwood Field, the project of A.H. \"Rick\" Woodward, a local iron baron who was manager of his company's baseball team, opened in 1910 and was named for him, the winning entry chosen from a contest sponsored by The Birmingham News. At the time, it was a modern marvel, a minor league ballpark modeled on the concrete and steel major league palaces of the era, like Philadelphia's Shibe Park and Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. One Birmingham newspaper called it the \"South's Finest Baseball Plant,\" while another described it as a \"model of beauty and convenience,\" where \"the patrons will be seated in opera chairs, large and comfortable.\"\n\nIts opening day on Aug. 18, 1910, was a citywide holiday, with offices and shops shuttered for the occasion. \"Not a crowd, not a throng, not a 'seething mass of humanity,'\" The Birmingham News declared on its front page. \"None of these terms will do to describe the great, waving, chattering, elbowing, laughing, striding, stumbling, and pushing bundles of sweltering folks who swarmed out into Rickwood park Thursday afternoon.\"\n\nBy the end of the decade, Black teams were allowed to play at Rickwood, paving the way for Mays' future stardom, and the Birmingham Barons played a doubleheader in September 1919 in front of \"the largest crowd that ever wedged itself in the enclosure at Rickwood,\" The Birmingham Age-Herald reported.\n\n\"This area and this town was, despite all of the history that we know in these Black communities, it was joy, and despite the racism, the Birmingham Black Barons were the toast of the town,\" Michael Mays said this week.\n\nThe week of baseball in Birmingham, he said, is an \"American celebration,\" and his hope is that it will bring more Black fans and more Black players to a game that has seen a steady decline in African American representation.\n\n\"It's a full circle moment,\" he said. \"It's a full circle moment for Major League Baseball. It's a full circle moment for Birmingham. It's a full circle moment for our families.\"\n\nRickwood Field is often called the oldest professional ballpark in America -- opening two years before Fenway Park in Boston -- but it is also the oldest big league ballpark. Four years ago MLB elevated the Negro Leagues to major league status as many American institutions began reconsidering their histories after the murder of George Floyd. The league has also begun integrating Negro Leagues statistics into its official record -- Willie Mays was recently credited with 10 more hits from his stint with the Black Barons -- and the game this week is a further step.\n\nThe ranks of veterans of the Negro Leagues is dwindling, and while many believe Major League Baseball's recognition should have come much earlier, Michael Mays said it was \"long overdue but strangely on time.\"\n\nThe week is a chance for the lesser-known players from the Negro Leagues to be honored, and Major League Baseball tracked many of them down and offered free tickets and a hotel room.\n\nAmong them is Charles Willis, 92, who still lives in his childhood home, a modest brick house in the Birmingham suburb of Fairfield, a few blocks from where Willie Mays, his childhood friend, lived. They played together in high school, Willis in center field then and Mays at shortstop. Willis played at Rickwood, too, but just one season. The other day he showed a visitor his baseball card, with a crisp scouting report on the back: \"speed with a great arm.\"\n\n\"That was the Black man's sport, back in the day, baseball,\" he said, and Black Barons games were always big events. \"If they were in town on Sunday and church service was held, the pastor had to get through the sermon early because if not, the folk are going to leave and go to the ballgame.\"\n\nReaf Blue, who played for the Black Barons and Atlanta Black Crackers in the late 1950s and early 1960s, grew up in the neighborhood surrounding Rickwood and still lives there. As a teenager, he got a job at the ballpark as a groundskeeper and cleaner, and worked his way up to center field.\n\nSometimes, when he worked there as a teenager, on game days, \"I had to put up a rope in the stands, with the Blacks on this side and the whites on that side. I really hated to put that rope up, but I had to put that rope up.\"\n\nRickwood touches history beyond baseball. A plaque outside the main entrance memorializes a women's suffrage rally held there in 1915, although nowhere is there a mention of the Ku Klux Klan gathering held at the ballpark in 1924, or anything about the career of Bull Connor, who called white Barons games on the radio before he became the violent enforcer of Jim Crow segregation in Birmingham as the commissioner of public safety.\n\nA few days ago, Michael Mays reflected on what Birmingham has come to mean to him, through his famous father.\n\n\"We all know about the hardship, we all know about the struggle, but the way they marched through it, like it wasn't nothing, and the joy, just all the happiness that really went on in the community despite the struggle,\" he said. \"I'm really sensing that, when I can come down here I can feel the core of my dad's character.\"", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was standing outside a small museum underneath the stands, where the next day fans would line up to see Mays' flower-draped Hall of Fame plaque, the first time it has left the wall in Cooperstown since it was installed at his induction in 1979. \"I have chill bumps. I can't think of any place to be than here.\"\n\nAt 114 years old, Rickwood Field is the nation's oldest professional ballpark, the first place Mays played pro ball and the last ballpark still standing that he called home. To honor the legacy of the Negro Leagues, Major League Baseball scheduled a game in Mays' hometown between the San Francisco Giants, Mays' old team, and the St. Louis Cardinals, that will be played on Thursday.\n\nThe Rev. William H. Greason, 99, who was the first Black pitcher for the Cardinals in the 1950s, has been a pastor in Birmingham for more than a half-century since retiring from baseball. He had been hoping to see his old friend this week, at the ballpark where they played together.\n\nIn 1948, Greason was a star pitcher for the Black Barons, baffling hitters with three types of curveballs, and Mays was a teenage star from a local high school who had dazzled on the sandlots, playing for industrial league teams fielded by the steel mills and coal mines. Greason became a mentor to the young Mays, and they won a league championship together and played in the last Negro World Series.\n\n\"We were good friends, and both of us just starting, it was easy for us to get along,\" Greason said.\n\nMajor League Baseball's tagline for the week, plastered on signs around the city, is \"A Tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" but it has been as much a celebration of Mays' singular life and legacy, now amplified with his death.\n\nThe Birmingham Civil Rights Institute this week unveiled an art installation of a towering Willie Mays baseball card. And on Monday evening, the marquee of the Carver Theater, once one of the few places Black people could see first-run movies during the time of Jim Crow, was lit up with Mays' name, for a screening of the 2022 documentary, \"Say Hey, Willie Mays!\"\n\nAfter the screening, Mays' son, Michael, told the audience that his father could not make it to Birmingham. \"He wants to be here bad,\" he said, adding, \"I think deep down what it is, is he don't show up halfway.\"\n\nWillie Mays issued a statement Monday evening to The San Francisco Chronicle, saying he was too unwell to travel, and reminiscing about Rickwood Field, describing it as \"like a church.\"\n\n\"The first big thing I ever put in my mind was to play at Rickwood Field,\" he said. \"It wasn't a dream. It was something I was going to do.\"\n\nRickwood Field, the project of A.H. \"Rick\" Woodward, a local iron baron who was manager of his company's baseball team, opened in 1910 and was named for him, the winning entry chosen from a contest sponsored by The Birmingham News. At the time, it was a modern marvel, a minor league ballpark modeled on the concrete and steel major league palaces of the era, like Philadelphia's Shibe Park and Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. One Birmingham newspaper called it the \"South's Finest Baseball Plant,\" while another described it as a \"model of beauty and convenience,\" where \"the patrons will be seated in opera chairs, large and comfortable.\"\n\nColumn: Baseball icon Willie Mays saluted at Wrigley Field on a memorable night\n\nIts opening day on Aug. 18, 1910, was a citywide holiday, with offices and shops shuttered for the occasion. \"Not a crowd, not a throng, not a 'seething mass of humanity,'\" The Birmingham News declared on its front page. \"None of these terms will do to describe the great, waving, chattering, elbowing, laughing, striding, stumbling, and pushing bundles of sweltering folks who swarmed out into Rickwood park Thursday afternoon.\"\n\nBy the end of the decade, Black teams were allowed to play at Rickwood, paving the way for Mays' future stardom, and Black teams from Birmingham and Montgomery played a doubleheader in September 1919 in front of \"the largest crowd that ever wedged itself in the enclosure at Rickwood,\" The Birmingham Age-Herald reported.\n\n\"This area and this town was, despite all of the history that we know in these Black communities, it was joy, and despite the racism, the Birmingham Black Barons were the toast of the town,\" Michael Mays said this week.\n\nThe week of baseball in Birmingham, he said, is an \"American celebration,\" and his hope is that it will bring more Black fans and more Black players to a game that has seen a steady decline in African American representation.\n\n\"It's a full circle moment,\" he said. \"It's a full circle moment for Major League Baseball. It's a full circle moment for Birmingham. It's a full circle moment for our families.\"\n\nRickwood Field is often called the oldest professional ballpark in America -- opening two years before Fenway Park in Boston -- but it is also the oldest big league ballpark. Four years ago MLB elevated the Negro Leagues to major league status as many American institutions began reconsidering their histories after the murder of George Floyd. The league has also begun integrating Negro Leagues statistics into its official record -- Willie Mays was recently credited with 10 more hits from his stint with the Black Barons -- and the game this week is a further step.\n\nThe ranks of veterans of the Negro Leagues are dwindling, and while many believe Major League Baseball's recognition should have come much earlier, Michael Mays said it was \"long overdue but strangely on time.\"\n\nThe week is a chance for the lesser-known players from the Negro Leagues to be honored, and Major League Baseball tracked many of them down and offered free tickets and a hotel room.\n\nAmong them is Charles Willis, 92, who still lives in his childhood home, a modest brick house in the Birmingham suburb of Fairfield, a few blocks from where Willie Mays, his childhood friend, lived. They played together in high school, Willis in center field then and Mays at shortstop. Willis played at Rickwood, too, but just one season. The other day he showed a visitor his baseball card, with a crisp scouting report on the back: \"speed with a great arm.\"\n\n\"That was the Black man's sport, back in the day, baseball,\" he said, and Black Barons games were always big events. \"If they were in town on Sunday and church service was held, the pastor had to get through the sermon early because if not, the folk are going to leave and go to the ballgame.\"\n\nReaf Blue, who played for the Black Barons and Atlanta Black Crackers in the late 1950s and early 1960s, grew up in the neighborhood surrounding Rickwood and still lives there. As a teenager, he got a job at the ballpark as a groundskeeper and cleaner, and worked his way up to center field.\n\nSometimes, when he worked there as a teenager, on game days, \"I had to put up a rope in the stands, with the Blacks on this side and the whites on that side. I really hated to put that rope up, but I had to put that rope up.\"\n\nRickwood touches history beyond baseball. A plaque outside the main entrance memorializes a women's suffrage rally held there in 1915, although nowhere is there a mention of the Ku Klux Klan gathering held at the ballpark in 1924, or anything about the career of Bull Connor, who called white Barons games on the radio before he became the violent enforcer of Jim Crow segregation in Birmingham as the commissioner of public safety.\n\nA few days ago, Michael Mays reflected on what Birmingham has come to mean to him, through his famous father.\n\n\"We all know about the hardship, we all know about the struggle, but the way they marched through it, like it wasn't nothing, and the joy, just all the happiness that really went on in the community despite the struggle,\" he said. \"I'm really sensing that, when I can come down here I can feel the core of my dad's character.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In May, MLB incorporated the available statistics of Negro League players into its own record book.\n\nRead more: MLB Will Make Negro League Statistics Official in Landmark Decision\n\nTo its credit, the league has done more than bestow \"official\" status on Negro League stats. It expanded its pension program to include living Negro League players -- of whom there are few -- and in conjunction with the MLB Players' Association, announced a $500,000 grant to fund charitable efforts to preserve the legacy of Negro Leaguers and strengthen education and well-being through youth sports.\n\nAlthough the last official Negro League game (according to MLB) was played in 1948, six Negro League parks remain standing as viable venues. One, Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, will host a unique regular season game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday.\n\nOpened on Aug. 18, 1910, Rickwood Field claims to be \"America's Oldest Ballpark.\" (Boston's Fenway Park would not open until two years later.) The National Register of Historic Places also notes that Rickwood's original concrete and steel grandstand is the oldest baseball grandstand on the same site in the United States.\n\nAs described in Mark McCarter's book Never a Bad Game: Fifty-Plus Years of the Southern League, the Birmingham Barons beat Montgomery 3-2 on Opening Day, and \"every major business in Birmingham shut down\" for the occasion.\n\nOver the decades that followed, Rickwood emerged as a temple for Black baseball in the segregated South. In 1948, it served as the site of the Homestead Grays' five-game victory over the Birmingham Black Barons in what would be the final Negro League World Series. According to MLB, 181 of the 351 members elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame played, managed, umpired, or led a baseball team at Rickwood Field.\n\nThe Giants were a natural choice for the game by virtue of their franchise icon, Willie Mays, who coincidentally passed away Tuesday at age 93. Mays debuted with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1948 before going on to a storied 23-year career with the Giants and New York Mets.\n\nRead more: Baseball World, Celebrities React to Willie Mays' Death\n\nThe two teams will wear specially designed uniforms as a tribute to the Negro Leagues teams -- a small part of a broader push to recognize Mays and his Negro Leagues contemporaries, whose origin stories, statistics, and legacies were long ignored by MLB.\n\nFOX will televise the Giants-Cardinals game, with the first pitch scheduled for 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time.", "source": {"uri":

It's the home of the Birmingham Black Barons, who played in the Negro Leagues.\n\nMays was unable to attend due to his health.\n\n\"I wish I could come out to Rickwood Field this week to be with you all and enjoy that field with my friends,\" Mays said in his final statement. \"Rickwood's been part of my life for all of my life. Since I was a kid. It was just 'around the corner there' from Fairfield [the town where Mays went to high school], and it felt like it had been there forever. Like a church.\n\n\"The first big thing I ever put my mind to was to play at Rickwood Field. It wasn't a dream. It was something I was going to do. I was going to work hard to be one of the Birmingham Black Barons and play ball at Rickwood Field.\n\n\"That's what I did. It was my start. My first job. You never forget that. Rickwood Field is where I played my first home game, and playing there was IT - everything I wanted.\n\n\"I'd like to be there, but I don't move as well as I used to. So I'm going to watch from my home. But it will be good to see that. I'm glad that the Giants, Cardinals and MLB are doing this, letting everyone get to see pro ball at Rickwood Field. Good to remind people of all the great ball that has been played there, and all the players.\n\n\"All these years and it is still here. So am I.

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nA landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nSports Week in Pictures: US Open golf, international soccer and more!

The Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates used the ballpark as a spring training site in the early 1900s.\n\nBaseball Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner were among the legends who came through. However, for many, fans got to see the talent of the Negro Leagues, including Willie Mays, who got his start with the Black Barons at the age of 17.\n\nHOW MLB'S RICKWOOD FIELD GAME WILL MAKE HUGE STATEMENT IN COMMUNITY -- AND BASEBALL\n\nMays, who passed away this week at 93, told the San Francisco Chronicle that playing in the majors was not something he thought he could attain - at least not until Jackie Robinson first broke the color barrier in baseball, and Larry Doby followed him in the American League.\n\nMays got his start with the New York Giants in 1951 and was the Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" he told the paper before his death. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nThursday night's game was set to honor Mays, who before his death announced he could not make the trip to Alabama.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nHOW MLB AT RICKWOOD FIELD WILL 'GIVE THE NEGRO LEAGUES THEIR FLOWERS'\n\nRickwood Field was also noted for its play in American Civil Rights history.\n\nIt was one of the sites of marches for voting rights and boycotts, but on the end, brutal beatings, civil unrest and bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" comedian Roy Wood Jr. told The Associated Press. \"... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nRickwood's head groundskeeper, Jabreil Weir, helped MLB get the facility ready to host a game.\n\nSome of the renovations included a new drainage system and backstop netting.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir told The Associated Press. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_gaydos@foxnews.com", "name": "Ryan Gaydos", "type":

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nThe setting will be Rickwood, which opened in 1910 and not only is the oldest facility still operating in baseball but has rich ties to the Negro Leagues as it was the home of the Black Barons.\n\n\"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise,\" Manfred added. \"From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nThe evening is being called \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" and the coverage on Fox begins at 5:30 p.m. ET with the first pitch scheduled for 7:15 p.m. ET. The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@omaha.com", "name":

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nThe setting will be Rickwood, which opened in 1910 and not only is the oldest facility still operating in baseball but has rich ties to the Negro Leagues as it was the home of the Black Barons.\n\n\"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise,\" Manfred added. \"From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nThe evening is being called \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" and the coverage on Fox begins at 5:30 p.m. ET with the first pitch scheduled for 7:15 p.m. ET. The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\nLocations Stlouis Be the first to

Revisiting the Birmingham Black Barons from 1920 to 1960", "body": "Rickwood Field is the oldest ballpark in America, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that it has a rich history.\n\nSome of baseball's greatest players have played at the stadium. More top-tier players will be in action there as the Cardinals and Giants play an MLB game at the field.\n\nRickwood no longer has a team that calls it home full-time. The Birmingham Barons -- the White Sox's Double-A affiliate -- now play at Regions Field, though they play the occasional game at Rickwood Field.\n\nBut from 1920 to 1960, Rickwood Field had two full-time teams play within its confines. The Barons were one and the Birmingham Black Barons -- a Negro League team that produced a handful of Hall of Famers -- were the other.\n\nHere's what to know about the Black Barons, as the Giants and MLB honor Willie Mays' first professional club.\n\nMORE: Willie Mays' career, from start with Black Barons to Hall of Fame run with Giants\n\nThe Birmingham Black Barons were one of the primary residents of Rickwood Field during the ballpark's heydey.\n\nThe Black Barons were a Negro League team that began playing in 1920. They played through the 1960 season and won four championships (1943, 1944, 1948 and 1959).\n\nMORE: Revisiting Willie Mays' Hall of Fame stats, accolades\n\nThe Black Barons began as a part of the Southern League, which Hall of Famer Rube Foster organized. The club spent the first 20 years of its history bouncing between the Southern League -- a minor league operation -- and the Negro National and American Leagues, which were at the professional level; this was due to financial issues stemming from The Great Depression, per the Negro Southern League Museum.\n\nAfter not playing during the 1939 season, the Black Barons established themselves as a Negro American League team and competed at that level for the final 20 years of their existence. They won four league titles after moving to that level, with their early success -- pennant wins in 1943 and 1944 -- came after Harlem Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein purchased the team.\n\nAfter baseball's integration, the Negro Leagues gradually declined, and attendance for the Black Barons thinned. As a result, the team converted into a barnstorming squad and played their final Negro League game in 1960. It is believed their final year sporting the Birmingham nickname came in 1962.\n\nMORE: Why Willie Mays was known as the 'Say Hey Kid'\n\nThe Black Barons saw five Hall of Famers play for them during their history. Willie Mays notably suited up for the squad when he was 17 while Satchel Paige became a dominant pitcher with the Black Barons during the 1927 run to the Negro League World Series.\n\nBelow is a look at the Black Barons to make the Baseball Hall of Fame:\n\nBeyond those Hall of Famers, the Black Barons also had Goose Tatum -- a.k.a. The Clown Prince of Basketball -- on the team. In the team's later years, Charlie Pride was their top player. He eventually became better known as a country singer.\n\nDan Bankhead, the first Black pitcher in MLB, also pitched for Birmingham in four of five seasons from 1940 to 1944.", "source": {"uri":

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad

This is a place where Willie Mays, among others, was standing in the outfield dreaming about being in the big leagues.\"\n\nNow, the big leagues are coming to Birmingham. Rickwood Field, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. and former home to baseball Hall of Famer Mays and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will host an MLB game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday afternoon, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nA landmark of hope\n\nRickwood Field sits just a few miles west of downtown Birmingham -- a rustic and modest green landmark with hints of history layered in its walls.\n\nIt's a time capsule of opportunity and oppression -- a site for social gatherings like women's suffrage rallies and other political events, and host to the best baseball talents of the 20th century. Commercials and baseball films have also been shot there, including parts of the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42.\"\n\nRickwood Field hosted Alabama's first integrated sports team, the minor league Birmingham Barons, in 1964 -- 17 years after Robinson integrated the majors. And it has seen more than 50% of baseball Hall of Famers walk its grounds, from legendary Negro Leaguers like Mays, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige to MLB greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle.\n\n\"The majors? I didn't dream about the impossible,\" Mays recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I was taught to see your goal in your mind and work toward it. I could work toward getting to Rickwood Field and the Birmingham Black Barons. I didn't need to dream for that. For that, I needed to work hard. So, I did. Rickwood became my training ground.\"\n\nMays became a star there at only 17 years old, helping the Black Barons reach the Negro League World Series in 1948. Major league scouts came to see him play, and the Black Barons were so popular locally that ministers sometimes preached early on Sundays to accommodate fans eager to attend games.\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history. I feel as strongly about Rickwood as someone would (feel) visiting their childhood home as an adult.\"\n\nWood played high school baseball at Rickwood Field in the 1990s. At the time, he said Rickwood was just another place for him to play the sport he loved. That changed when he learned the history.\n\n'A place where horror was allowed to take a pause'\n\nThe 10,800-seat stadium opened in 1910 during a time when baseball was the premier sport in Alabama. With few major league franchises in the South during those days, baseball fans in Alabama clung to minor league teams like the all-white Birmingham Barons, who played at Rickwood from 1910-1961, 1964-65 and 1981-87. Other white stars -- like Hall of Famers Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner -- came through Rickwood for spring exhibitions. Alabama and Auburn both used Rickwood as home fields for their college football teams.\n\nFor Black people, Rickwood and the Negro Leagues were an introduction to Black athletic talent.\n\n\"This league creates common heroes, common teams,\" said Rob Ruck, a historian focusing on Black and Latino roots in sport, \"a national institution that Black Americans rally around, and it gives them a collective self-esteem because of their abilities in sport.\"\n\nThe field was also a bright spot amid the fight for racial equality in the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama, one of the epicenters of the Civil Rights Movement, was the site of marches for voting rights and boycotts, as well as brutal beatings, civil unrest and deadly bombings.\n\n\"It was a place where horror was allowed to take a pause for nine innings,\" Wood said. \" ... Rickwood was never going to solve Black people's problems, but it represented a place where Black people didn't have to think about them for a few hours.\"\n\nMaintaining history\n\nThe ballpark is still standing against many odds. Built around the same time as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Philadelphia's Shibe Park, Chicago's Comiskey Park and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Rickwood has outlasted them all, with high school and college games still being played there.\n\nWatkins and the Friends of Rickwood organization made up of about 30 volunteers have maintained it, along with others like Jabreil Weir, the head groundskeeper in charge of the field's day-to-day upkeep.\n\n\"Who would have thought MLB would come to Birmingham, Alabama?\" Weir said. \"Who ever thought that I would be in the position that I am to be a part of this event? These are moments that you dream of.\"\n\nWeir has worked with MLB in preparing the stadium to host a major league game. Renovations include a new field with lights, upgraded dugouts, a new drainage system and a new backstopping netting system to protect fans during the game, according to Murray Cook, MLB's field and stadium consultant.\n\nOther events have been held this week, including a Double-A game at the ballpark on Tuesday between the Birmingham Barons and Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League. The game was paused while the PA announcer shared news of Mays' death, and fans reacted by standing, cheering and chanting \"Willie! Willie!\"\n\nThe game is part of an ongoing effort by MLB to highlight and celebrate achievements of Black players -- a push that comes amid criticism for a league where the percentage of Black major leaguers is historically low. MLB's endeavors have also included grassroots programs for underprivileged youth players and the recent integration of Negro Leagues statistics into its official records.\n\n\"This gives us an opportunity to talk about race in the context of sport,\" Ruck said, adding later, \"We've got to talk about race in serious ways, and I think this game, the stats, make that happen.\"\n\nSports Week

While Birmingham now plays at the newer Regions Field, it has played at least one game at the historic stadium nearly every year since 1981.\n\nBut yesterday's game held special significance as the entire baseball world will have its eyes on the venue and the entire city of Birmingham on Thursday. The two teams embodied the spirit of the week by playing under their respective cities' old Negro League names, the Birmingham Black Barons and Montgomery Grey Sox.\n\n\"When the guys showed up, they looked around they're like, 'This looks incredible,'\" Barons manager Sergio Santos said. \"It's amazing. It's a very unique game and something they're all grateful and appreciative to be a part of.\"\n\nIn addition to serving as the home for the Double-A Barons, Rickwood was notably the home of the Black Barons for over 20 years. Countless Negro League legends came through and played at the field, but one looms large over the upcoming game.\n\nThe entire baseball world came to a halt yesterday with the announcement that Willie Mays, possibly the greatest player to ever grace a baseball diamond, had passed away at the age of 93. Before becoming a 24-time all-star with the Giants and Mets, Mays made his professional debut with the Black Barons in 1948. Mays' passing was announced mid-game over the PA system, and the crowd honored the Hall of Famer with a standing ovation. Mays was expected to be honored at the game, but it was announced early this week that he would not be in attendance just two days before his passing.\n\nThursday's game will now serve as a commemoration of Mays' life and career, in addition to being a tribute to the Negro Leagues as a whole.\n\nThe game is only possible thanks to extensive renovations to the field. Over $5 million has been poured into repairing the venue over the past year to modernize the stadium and prepare it for an MLB-level audience.\n\n\"The upgrades they've done... over the last year -- replacing the entire field, extending the nets, redoing the dugouts -- all those are designed for player and fan safety,\" Barons General Manager Jonathan Nelson said. \"So not only does it enhance the overall experience, but it certainly extends the life of Rickwood Field.\"\n\nRickwood Field is possibly the most historically significant active ballpark in the sport. From Mays, Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, Josh Gibson, and Roy Campanella, who played there during their time in the Negro Leagues, to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Mickey Mantle, Honus Wagner, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and Roberto Clemente, who played there in spring games, to Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson, who played there as members of the Barons, the story of Rickwood is the story of baseball and the story of American sports as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad

The game will be played at Rickwood Field, the oldest baseball park in the US.\n\nBuilt and opened in 1910, Rickwood Field was the first steel-and-concrete baseball stadium south of the Ohio River and the first built specifically for minor-league baseball. Rickwood hosted the Birmingham Barons and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues for most of the 20th century. The MLB will use the game to pay tribute to the Negro Leagues and honor those who played in them.\n\nRickwood Field has been graced by many baseball legends in its storied history. Here are some of the most famous players to have played at Rickwood Field:\n\nWillie Mays\n\nOne of the greatest players of all time played his first professional games at Rickwood Field. Willie Mays, a native of Fairfield, Alabama, who passed away on Tuesday, attended high school just around the corner from Rickwood and signed his first contract with the Black Barons at the age of 17. He led the Black Barons to a Negro American League pennant and a Negro World Series appearance in 1948.\n\nMays signed with the New York Giants in 1950 and was playing in the majors by 1951. \"The Say Hey Kid\" was the NL Rookie of the Year and led the Giants to a National League pennant in 1951. In 1954, he was the NL MVP, and the Giants won the World Series. Mays was a 24-time All-Star and 12-time Golden Glove winner. He was a first-ballot Baseball Hall of Famer in 1979.\n\nSatchel Paige\n\nLeroy \"Satchel\" Paige joined the Black Barons in 1927 and played at Rickwood through 1929. In the 1929 season, Paige threw a Negro League record 176 strikeouts, though the actual number of strikeouts is disputed among various sources.\n\nPaige bounced around the Negro Leagues until 1948 when he signed his first major league contract with the Cleveland Indians. Paige became the oldest debutant in MLB history when he made his debut at 42 years and two days old. Still, he pitched in the major leagues until 1965, earning two All-Star nods and winning a World Series along the way. Paige played until he was 59, making him the oldest player in MLB history by nearly a decade.\n\nHank Aaron\n\nAnother all-time great, Hank Aaron got his start in the Negro American League with the Indianapolis Clowns. He likely only played a game or two at Rickwood with the Clowns, as his Negro League career only lasted 26 games before the Milwaukee Braves purchased his contract. However, the Braves played a spring exhibition series against the Brooklyn Dodgers at Rickwood during Aaron's first spring training in 1954, and he would often visit the field during spring training throughout his career.\n\nAaron's 755 career home runs stood as an MLB record for 33 years, and he still holds league records with 2,297 RBIs, 1,477 extra-base hits and 6,856 total bases.\n\nErnie Banks\n\n\"Mr. Cub\" played for the Kansas City Monarchs during his time in the Negro Leagues and played against the Black Barons at Rickwood. He was a 14-time All-Star and two-time NL MVP with the Chicago Cubs and was the first player in franchise history to have his number retired.\n\nJackie Robinson\n\nThe player who famously broke baseball's color barrier in 1948, Jackie Robinson played two games at Rickwood Field. Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers played a pair of exhibition games against Aaron and the Milwaukee Braves during the spring of 1954. The 2013 film \"42\" about Robinson's life features scenes shot on-location in Rickwood.\n\nReggie Jackson\n\nIn 1967, the Kansas City Athletics brought their Double-A farm team to Birmingham. Many of the players on that team became key parts of the A's 1972-74 World Series threepeat, including \"Mr. October,\" who was the AL MVP in 1973.\n\nBabe Ruth and Ty Cobb\n\nDespite never playing in the Negro Leagues, \"the Great Bambino\" and \"the Georgia Peach\" both played at Rickwood Field. The stadium's location near a railway hub made it convenient for traveling major leaguers to stop and see it on the way back from spring training to their home cities. Stopping to see the stadium often meant they would play an exhibition game there, and Ruth and Cobb were just two of the many legends who did so.\n\nLike Robinson's, Cobb's 1994 biopic, \"Cobb,\" was also shot on-location in Rickwood.", "source": {"uri": "eu.montgomeryadvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Montgomery Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

William Greason said of Mays, who died Tuesday at the age of 93. \"He had a gift that God gave him.\"\n\nGreason, now almost 100 years old, was Mays' teammate on the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues.\n\n\"The camaraderie that we had on that team, it was out of sight,\" said Greason, who added that, at the time, he had no idea he was playing alongside one of baseball's all-time greats.\n\n\"I just wanted to be a friend,\" Greason told CBS News.\n\nMays was too young to travel with the Black Barons, who barnstormed the Jim Crow South as a member of the Negro Southern League.\n\nAt Rickwood Field, which the Black Barons shared with the all-White Birmingham Barons, segregation was the enforced custom.\n\n\"When we played here, the Whites were in right field,\" Greason said. \"When they played, we were out there.\"\n\nSince 1910, 182 MLB Hall of Famers, both Black and White, have graced Rickwood's grounds. Legends like Reggie Jackson, Babe Ruth and \"Hammerin' Hank\" Aaron.\n\nWhen the St. Louis Cardinals play the San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field Thursday in a game that will pay tribute to both Mays and the legacy of the Negro Leagues, Cardinals shortstop Masyn Winn will be a rarity -- an African American on a Major League roster.\n\n\"Being maybe the only Black person on the field is going to be pretty special for me to represent that out there,\" said Winn, acknowledging, though, that the situation speaks poorly of the state of African Americans in baseball right now.\n\n\"I think it just means we need more,\" Winn said.\n\nIn 1991, 18% of players on opening day rosters were African American, according to numbers from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. This season, that is down to 6%.\n\nBut there are signs that could be changing. In 2022, four of the top five draft picks were African American. In 2021, MLB announced a $150 million investment aimed at increasing Black representation in baseball.\n\nAnd last month, statistics from the Negro Leagues were officially incorporated into MLB record books.\n\n\"I think it's cool to have that Black representation up there,\" Winn said of that move. \"I think it's good for the next generation.\"\n\nMLB had planned for Mays to attend the Rickwood game, a ballpark just six miles from Mays' boyhood home. Now, the field where Mays' baseball dreams began will poetically symbolize the end of that era and possibly the dawn of a new one.\n\n\"Many of those stats happened ... right here at Rickwood Field,\" Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin told CBS News. \"...What happened here is not just Black history, it's America's history. And the greats that came through this place, they literally went on to change what baseball meant.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Southern_League_(1920\u20131936)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negro Southern League (1920\u20131936)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Crow laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babe Ruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Woodfin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randall Woodfin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conscription in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/19/dbf37630-6951-4c36-9c9b-4d7f0217b727/thumbnail/1200x630/e4b33caa4e7cd7026479cc45f9c67f2f/gettyimages-2157661660.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This is just a glimpse into why the commemoration of the Negro Leagues by Major League Baseball at the legendary Rickwood Field will be a three-day celebration of the life of baseball legend Willie Mays.\n\nVisit streaming.thesource.com for more information\n\nNot only is Rickwood Field one of the premiere stadiums of the Negro Leagues, where Mays began his professional baseball career as a member of the Birmingham Black Barons, but Birmingham, Alabama is also the birthplace of Mays, who's commonly known among baseball enthusiasts as the \"Say Hey Kid\". There will be an inaugural Juneteenth event that proceeds the big game between Mays' MLB alma mater San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals. Wednesday's \"Birmingham Barnstorm\" Fam Jam Celebrity Softball Game is a face-off between Derek Jeter's \"Hammers\" honoring the late home run king Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds Jr.'s \"Sey Heys\", who are playing in the name of Bonds' godfather, who is none other than, you guessed it, Willie Mays. Bonds' who is currently Major League's asterisked all time home run leader, has always told intimate stores of his late godfather and because of their close relationship, this could be the reason that Bonds may not be able to serve as the Sey Heys' team captain today.\n\nThe main attraction will, of course, be tomorrow's game between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at the historic Birmingham field and to properly recognize the contributions of the Negro Leagues to what we know today as Major League Baseball, the two MLB teams will be wearing replicas of the Negro League uniforms. The Giants will be playing as the \"SeaLions\", which was a West Coast Negro League team based in San Francisco in 1946. West Virginia-born Marcenia Lyle Stone aka Toni Stone, began playing for the Sea Lions in 1949, becoming the first female to ever play in the Negro Leagues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe St. Louis Cards will be donning \"St. Louis Stars\" uniforms, repping for the Negro National League's three-time champions, the St. Louis Stars. Playing from 1922-1931, the Stars' roster included several Negro League Hall Of Famers including Willie Wells, James Thomas Bell aka \"Cool Papa Bell\", Mule Nettles and others.\n\nAs described by MLB.com., \"fans will witness another kind of history as stars of entertainment, sports and baseball descend on Birmingham\" as the celebrity softball game, which will include notables such as Karen Civil, DC Young Fly, Terrell Owens, Omari Hardwick and a host of MLB legends including former Phillies star Jimmy Rollins, the Yankees' CC Sabathia and Alex Rodriguez, \"Big Papi\" David Ortiz, Adam Jones and countless others. The game will conclude with a feature performance by ATL super producer Metro Boomin, who will definitely bring out the crowds who aren't necessarily baseball fans.\n\nArguably the best all around player in baseball, the Birmingham-born \"King of the Diamond\" will definitely be honored in regal baseball fashion at Rickwood. The Negro League Baseball Museum will notably recognize Mr. Mays in all of the ceremonies, as the President of the NLBM Bob Kendrick gave this statement about the passing of Mays.\n\n\"All of us at the Negro League Baseball Museum are devastated by the news of the passing of the great Willie Mays. Willie so beautifully represented the heart and soul of everything that made the Negro Leagues special on the road to becoming a Hall of Famer and in the hearts and minds of many, the greatest Major Leaguer of all time. While our hearts are heavy, we'll remember and celebrate him for the unbridled joy he brought to the game! We extend our heartfelt condolences to the Mays family and his legion of fans worldwide.'\"\n\nThe Birmingham Barnstorm celebrity softball game wil begin tonight at 7PM EST while the Negro League Tribute will be held tomorrow(June 20) AT 6:15PM EST and can be seen on FOX Sports.\n\nMLB is extending the Rickwood Game \"Beyond the Ballpark\" to the Birmingham community at four local bars and restaurants on Thursday, June 20. The official \"Beyond the Ballpark\" watch parties start at 5 p.m. CT at the following locations:\n\nContinental Drift\n\n2201 7th Ave S\n\nBirmingham, AL 35233\n\nRSVP HERE\n\nDenim on 7th\n\n2808

Mays, the electrifying center fielder who left an enduring mark on baseball, died Tuesday, a day after announcing that he wouldn't attend the game in person.\n\n\"All of Major League Baseball is in mourning today as we are gathered at the very ballpark where a career and a legacy like no other began,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise. From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\n\"Rickwood is special because it's where so many baseball careers began, and it's still standing,\" said Roy Wood Jr., a comedian and actor born in Birmingham. \"When you're there, you can still feel that history.

And for decades, Rickwood hosted legendary Black and white baseball players - but Black players and fans were treated like second-class citizens.\n\nThose memories are bitter for some local civil rights activists and foot soldiers, who fought to tear down the segregation that crowded them into one corner of the park.\n\nJohn Alexander grew up on the west side of Birmingham, near Rickwood Field. He remembers setting up a folding chair in a friend's backyard so he could listen to broadcasts of the game.\n\n\"We couldn't go to Rickwood on the days when we wanted to go, but we did get a chance to experience it,\" he said.\n\nThe game at Rickwood, the oldest professional baseball stadium in the United States, will be the first in-season Major League Baseball game to be played in Alabama, although MLB recently integrated Negro League games into its history. It is billed as a tribute to the Negro Leagues. While the city's civil rights community continues seeking recognition in their fight for equality, other activists hope the Rickwood game will inspire a new legacy for the field.\n\n\"Of course there is room for improvement,\" Takia Hudson, a social justice activist, said. \"But I see unity in our communities because of sports. As they honor the Negro League, they honor humanity...The purpose of the game is to show the advancements that we as human beings have made. We also embrace the hardship that was required for this to be accomplished.\"\n\nThe city's response\n\n\"Since it was announced that the MLB would be coming to Birmingham, the Negro Southern League Museum has received an unprecedented amount of interest from national media, documentarians and visitors who all want to know more about these men and women and their contribution to baseball. This has regenerated newfound interest in the League and breathed new life into their stories,\" Marie Sutton, the City of Birmingham public information officer said.\n\n\"The City of Birmingham's celebration of these individuals is year-round. Each year, the Negro Southern League Museum hosts an annual luncheon in their honor, celebrates a community-wide Jackie Robinson Day and many other activities to highlight the contributions of these athletes who broke records in baseball and in the civil rights movement.\"\n\nThe Negro Southern League Museum partners with the city of Birmingham to bring the stories of the Negro League to Birmingham residents.\n\n\"I don't know that we've had much conversation with civil rights communities, I think in the future we'd like to include as much of the community in these conversations as possible,\" Anthony Williams, interim director of the Negro Southern League Museum, said.\n\nWilliams said that while the museum features a tribute to Rickwood Field, including a home base and uniform from the field's early days, he hopes to work with the civil rights community to include stories of activists and how baseball played a role in social justice movement.\n\n\"The museum's role is important as far as when all of this is over, people will still have a place to come and learn about all the things that have been the focus of national attention in these recent days,\" Williams said. \"From history we can carve out a new path that is unifying and that includes each citizen equally. I think the city's investment in this museum and in Rickwood is a way of reclaiming the story of Birmingham.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball representatives said the game is an investment in local community as A.G. Gaston Construction, a local Black owned company, is the primary contractor for the field's $5 million refurbishment; more than 200 part-time employment opportunities for all Rickwood events were given to local residents; and a financial program to support Negro Leagues players was expanded.\n\nCommunity members are highlighting the efforts of civil rights activists in the lead-up to the game. Efforts include a podcast hosted by Roy Wood Jr. featuring Negro League veterans and the legacy of Black baseball on the city's social justice movement; the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute displaying a 24-foot Willie Mays baseball card outside the museum; and a Negro Leagues Family Alliance Bruncheon and Reception hosted at the Negro Southern League Museum.\n\nActivists say it's important for Major League Baseball, and fans watching the June 20 game, to recognize the work it took to get to this moment.\n\nMemories of Rickwood Field: 'The good, the bad and the ugly'\n\nFor decades, baseball weaved its way into every aspect of Birmingham city life. It was a part of children's dreams, Birmingham's path to industrialization and even local civil rights history.\n\nAnd Rickwood was the center of that history.\n\nWilliam Merriweather III, a 72-year-old foot soldier in the civil rights movement, said his first experience at a game at Rickwood, 60 years ago, kept him from ever wanting to return.\n\n\"We had a hard time trying to go to the baseball game because it was really for whites. Being a child, you asked your daddy, 'Can we go to a baseball game,' and daddy would say, 'There might be repercussions because of the color of your skin,'\" Merriweather said.\n\nWhen his father finally gave in and took his family out to a Rickwood game, Merriweather said he remembers being questioned by white patrons and having to sit in the Blacks-only section of the stadium. Rickwood desegregated in 1964.\n\n\"I always wanted to go see Willie Mays and the Black Barons but couldn't because of the color of my skin,\" Merriweather said. \"It didn't sit right with me as a child.\"\n\nMerriweather said he hopes the city can right these wrongs by giving free Rickwood tickets to local community members and foot soldiers.\n\nTerry Collins, another foot soldier, said baseball was all around him when he was growing up.\n\nAt the time, the Birmingham Housing Authority created baseball teams for every neighborhood, for all ages.\n\nAs a child, Collins looked up to Willie Young, a one-handed American Negro League pitcher for the Birmingham Black Barons. Collins also remembers his father selling bags of peanuts to raise money for a youth baseball team.\n\n\"Rickwood Field played a major role in African American baseball,\" Collins said. \"Baseball was a major component in the Black community.\"\n\nCollins said he wished the city had done more to include the civil rights community, foot soldiers and activists, to highlight the efforts to bring the historic game to a place so tied to the human rights movement.\n\n\"The importance of baseball, the significance of it, is changed because of integration,\" Collins said.\n\nFor John Alexander and his friends, learning about the success of the Black Barons inspired them despite the discrimination they knew the players faced.\n\n\"Baseball was a way out for our Black youth,\" Alexander said.\n\nAt 18, Alexander began coaching youth baseball teams with the Birmingham Housing Authority, which he did for more than 20 years. Alexander said some of his teachers even played for the Black Barons, including Freddy Shepard and Wiley Griggs.\n\nBirmingham has had ample opportunities to invest in youth sports, such as the plan for Major League Baseball to build a $10 million baseball facility that was abandoned because of \"Birmingham politics,\" various foot soldiers said.\n\nAlexander said he wishes the city would invest more money and effort into youth sports like it once had.\n\n\"They always said baseball was a white man's game, but that just wasn't so because we had baseball when we didn't have anything else,\" Alexander said.\n\nThe activist Takia Hudson grew up two blocks away from Rickwood Field. The last baseball game Hudson ever played was at Rickwood, as a pitcher for Jackson-Olin High School.\n\nHis aunt worked at Rickwood and caught the foul balls to give to her nephew. He remembers how his mother used to sneak the neighborhood kids in through the back gate at Rickwood.\n\n\"Those are the sorts of things that made Rickwood what it was, the good, the bad and the ugly,\" Hudson said.\n\n\"It takes us back down memory lane for the community that embraced baseball,\" Hudson said. \"For MLB to come, it's just another level of excitement because that's the best of the best of baseball around the world in our neighborhood. It lets us know that the efforts of the foot soldiers and the efforts of civil rights leaders have not been totally in vain.\"", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Southern_League_(1920\u20131936)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Negro Southern League (1920\u20131936)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_A._Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony A.

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPizza Hut restaurants abruptly close across Northwest Indiana after franchisee is accused of defaulting on payments Davich: Pizza Hut manager's first clue of abrupt closing: 'Fatal error' NWI Business Ins and Outs: True BBQ closed; Birdie's Diner, Next Door at Birdie's, Broad Street Tavern, Whihala Ice Cream, Lenny's Coal-Fired Pizza and Beauty and the Bronze opening Overnight closures of Northwest Indiana's Pizza Huts were years in the making, court records show Family of Crown Point ironworker sues after 100-floot plunge at University of Chicago Hospital, faced with 'life-altering, catastrophic injuries' Downtown Valparaiso has been named a quiet zone Lake Central outlasts Mooresville to win second state title Downtown, racetrack, Kennedy Avenue projects moving ahead in Schererville Crown Point man, 73, sent to prison over his role in Jan. 6 Capitol breach, feds say Franciscan Health building a $185.5 million, five-story hospital addition in Munster Portage police shoot man with gun; investigation underway, county says Second person dies in wake of alleged OWI crash; charge enhanced, records show Man dead after being burned Monday in garage fire, officials say Pedestrian struck in fatal crash identified by coroner New stores open at Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets\n\nThe setting will be Rickwood, which opened in 1910 and not only is the oldest facility still operating in baseball but has rich ties to the Negro Leagues as it was the home of the Black Barons.\n\n\"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise,\" Manfred added. \"From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nThe evening is being called \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" and the coverage on Fox begins at 5:30 p.m. ET with the first pitch scheduled for 7:15 p.m. ET. The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly

(WBRC) - A week of celebration turning somber, as one of Alabama's greatest athletes has passed away.\n\nReaction has poured in from across the country after Willie Mays, \"The Say Hey Kid,\" died Tuesday at the age of 93.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants announced the passing of Mays Tuesday night, just two days before they're set to play in Birmingham at Rickwood Field.\n\nMays, a Westfield native, started his illustrious career with the Birmingham Black Barons before becoming a 24-time MLB All-Star and one of only nine people to hit 600 home runs in his career.\n\nThere has been an outpouring of condolences and tributes to Mays as the eyes of the baseball world are on Birmingham.\n\nOn Wednesday, a brunch was held at the Negro Southern League Museum, a facility set aside to preserve and tell the history of the Negro Leagues.\n\nDuring the brunch, folks celebrated and honored the Negro Leagues and their records finally being included among MLB records.\n\nDoug Foster, who is related to Andrew Foster, the founder of the Negro Leagues, and Bill Foster, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said he was saddened by the news of Willie Mays' passing because he was such an inspiration.\n\nBut Foster says events like these give us the opportunity to remember their legacy.\n\n\"He played the sport of baseball, and he was successful unlike any other. So obviously, very disappointed but again this is an opportunity to highlight his contributions along with other Negro League players, so we're going to take advantage of the moment, and really use his passing as a way to honor him and other Negro League players,\" Foster said.\n\nIn addition to the brunch, a mural honoring Hays was unveiled Wednesday, June 19.\n\nThe mural was designed by artist Chuck Styles and focuses on Mays' Hall of Fame career, including his time playing for the Birmingham Black Barons.\n\n\"He really brought a certain pizzazz to baseball that wasn't there before and he kind of pioneered the era of the replay. We need to see that play again because it was so special andI think that speaks to the type of athlete that we have in this area and just how special sports means to people in this region,\" said Anthony Williams, director of the Negro Southern League Museum.\n\nLots of folks came out to see the mural, including Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who was also saddened when he heard the news of Mays' passing.\n\nWoodfin says with it being Juneteenth, there is no better day to celebrate him than on a day that celebrates Black excellence.\n\nThe mural means so much more now that Mays has passed on. His legacy and impact will be remembered for years to come.\n\nThese events are all leading up to the MLB at Rickwood Field game on Thursday, June 20.", "source": {"uri": "wbrc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wbrc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Foster_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Foster (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfield, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westfield, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Southern_League_(1920\u20131936)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negro Southern League (1920\u20131936)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Woodfin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randall Woodfin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://gray-wbrc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/TF75RX4ZJZF2NNBAY4MBJOPU2I.jpg?auth=65550f35befb9dc708edc65b89e28c94567087bf3c0f0947d30c67a2383a4cfe&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1701}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2710, "textEnd": 2717}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

All these great players that they're talking about are no longer with us. But as far as the family members, it's exciting for us to carry on that legacy through our family members who played in the Negro Leagues.\"\n\nGibson's name is brought up for obvious reasons. With the addition of the Negro Leagues stats, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and Homestead Grays star became MLB's career leader in batting average, slugging percentage and OPS, as well as the holder of the single-season records in each of those categories. Passing legends such as Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth etched Gibson's name firmly in baseball history.\n\nFor that reason, Topps and Fanatics Collectibles have signed a multi-year contract extension with Gibson's estate and will include Gibson in the Topps MLB at Rickwood Field series this month, ensuring that the legacy of Josh Gibson will continue to be told in the form of collectible trading cards.\n\nTopps has been making cards with Gibson since 2001. Since 2015, the company has made 31 cards, including this year's releases in the 2024 Allen and Ginter set and the 2024 Tribute Base Cards, among others.\n\n\"I think given the momentum of the Rickwood game, as well as the Negro Leagues properly and finally being included in MLB record books, it only made sense to extend our relationship with Josh Gibson and the family,\" Omar Wilkes, head of athlete partnerships at Fanatics Collectibles, told Yahoo Sports.\n\n\"I think it's our duty to use our platform and our history of having a world-class trading card product connected with baseball to amplify and kind of keep his legacy going on forever.\"\n\nYet even with the new contract and the newfound attention and praise, the Gibson family never needed MLB's sign of approval or validation that Gibson's accolades mattered.\n\n\"We always considered our Negro League family members major leaguers anyways,\" Sean Gibson said. \"It's just that Major League Baseball didn't recognize them as major leaguers.\"\n\nThe words \"Negro League family members\" isn't just a term of endearment. Gibson, along with other descendants of Negro Leagues players, created the Negro League Family Alliance. The group's mission is \"to collectively preserve the legacies, history and intellectual properties of the Negro Leagues,\" according to their website.\n\nOne member of that group is former Negro Leagues player Ron \"Schoolboy\" Teasley. Following the death of Willie Mays on Tuesday, the 97-year-old Teasley and 99-year-old Bill Greason are the only two living players from the Negro Leagues era.\n\nTeasley is one of the few players from that time who got to see the Negro Leagues statistics added to the major league records during his lifetime. Willie Mays, who played for the Birmingham Black Barons, was another, seeing his hit total rise by 10.\n\nThat's arguably the thing that means the most for Gibson after years of fighting for the stats incorporation.\n\n\"This was something I really wanted to do before he passed away. He played with the New York Cubans in 1948,\" he said. \"I'm excited to see Mr. Teasley get a chance to see his name and officially [be in the] MLB record book. I'm really excited about that.\"\n\nGibson will be representing his family's estate during MLB's Rickwood Field game between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday. As part of the deal with Topps, an 18 x 24, 8,000-pound card of Gibson from the pre-Rickwood game tour will be given to the Josh Gibson Foundation.\n\nWhile it's certainly too large to fit into a pocket or collectible trading card sleeve, Gibson already has an idea of where the foundation will put the massive piece of memorabilia.\n\n\"We definitely wanna have that card in Pittsburgh,\" he said. \"But I feel like right now, with the way Josh is being talked about through the MLB record books, that card has to be in Pittsburgh for some point, for some period of time.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Topps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Crawfords", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Crawfords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Grays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homestead Grays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trading card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty Cobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babe Ruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Greason", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Greason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Cubans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Cubans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c5Yk6fDtf4UR_3H9Swjnzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MzE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/b9e5f603df90ec504f405dc1688d4e63", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It has been a sanctuary for many of baseball's greatest players, including iconic figures from the Negro Leagues. Satchel Paige, known for his incredible pitching ability and showmanship, amazed crowds with his fastball and charisma. The late Willie Mays, who started his career with the Birmingham Black Barons, showcased his five-tool talent that would later make him a Major League Baseball star and Hall of Fame inductee. The legendary Josh Gibson, often referred to as the \"Black Babe Ruth,\" captivated fans with his extraordinary hitting power, leaving an indescribable mark on the sport.\n\nFans inside Rickwood Field witnessed countless memorable moments, serving as a cultural and historical cornerstone for over a century. From its charming wooden grandstands to the timeless feel of its diamond, Rickwood Field continues to evoke nostalgia and reverence among baseball enthusiasts.\n\nThis hallowed ground, where dreams have been realized and history made, truly embodies \"the field of dreams.\"\n\nWhat Was\n\nRickwood Field, established in 1910, stands as a monument to baseball's rich history and enduring legacy. Built by industrialist Rick Woodward, it quickly became a central hub for America's pastime. The field's opening game on August 18, 1910, saw the Birmingham Barons face off against the Montgomery Climbers, setting the stage for over a century of baseball excellence.\n\nThe importance of Rickwood Field extends beyond its status as the oldest surviving professional baseball park. It played a crucial role in the development and integration of baseball. During the segregation era, Rickwood was a primary venue for Negro League games, hosting teams like the hometown Birmingham Black Barons. The field became a stage where Black players could showcase their talents, breaking down racial barriers and paving the way for the integration of Major League Baseball.\n\nRickwood Field's historical significance is further highlighted by its continuous use for baseball and its preservation as a living museum. It has seen countless future Hall of Famers grace its diamond, including legends from both the Major Leagues and Negro Leagues. The field has also served as a cultural gathering place for the Birmingham community, hosting everything from minor league games to vintage baseball events.\n\nRickwood Field is not just a ballpark; it's a testament to the enduring spirit of baseball. As \"the field of dreams,\" it continues to inspire new generations of players and fans, celebrating the sport's storied past while looking forward to its future.\n\nA Groundbreaking Shift\n\nFrom the sweet home of Rickwood Field to the major leagues, the Negro Leagues are finally getting the recognition they deserve. In May of 2024, Major League Baseball (MLB) officially integrated the statistics of the Negro Leagues, and these stats have made significant changes to what we thought we knew about baseball history.\n\nThe recent integration of Negro League statistics into the MLB records marks a groundbreaking shift in the landscape of baseball history. This significant move has led to substantial revisions in historical records, placing Negro League legends in their deserved places among baseball's all-time greats. One of the most remarkable outcomes of this integration is that Josh Gibson, often celebrated as the \"Black Babe Ruth,\" now stands atop several key statistical categories, highlighting his extraordinary talent and contributions to the sport.\n\nJosh Gibson: The New Number One\n\nWith the inclusion of Negro League stats, Josh Gibson's incredible achievements are now officially recognized by MLB. Gibson's career statistics are nothing short of phenomenal, and their inclusion has catapulted him to the top of several of the games beloved categories.\n\nGibson's career batting average, now recognized as .365, is among the highest in baseball history, surpassing the averages of many MLB legends. While the exact numbers are debated, Gibson is credited with hitting between 800 and 1,000 home runs over his career, which places him ahead of Barry Bonds' MLB record of 762 home runs. Gibson's career slugging percentage is estimated to be around .690, which would place him at the top of this category, surpassing even Babe Ruth's .690. These statistics not only highlight Gibson's dominance but also emphasize the exceptional level of talent that existed within the Negro Leagues.\n\nWhat does this mean for the MLB\n\nThe inclusion of Negro League statistics serves as a vital correction of the historical record, acknowledging the immense contributions of Black players who were prohibited from MLB due to racial segregation. This move ensures that their legacies are preserved and celebrated within the broader context of baseball history.\n\nThis change also holds profound cultural and social significance. By formally acknowledging the achievements of Negro League players, MLB is making a powerful statement about the importance of diversity and inclusion in sports and society. It highlights the need to rectify historical injustices and honor the talent that was overlooked for decades.\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe integration of Negro League statistics into MLB records is a pivotal moment in baseball history.

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

The week surrounding the game itself and Juneteenth has been spent honoring icons such as Mays that paved the way for progress to be made in society and on the baseball diamond.\n\nMays grew up in Westfield, Alabama, where he dreamed of playing at Rickwood Field for the Birmingham Black Barons. He debuted for his hometown club as a 17-year-old in 1947, the same year Jackie Robinson integrated professional baseball in the United States. He made his major league debut in 1951 and won two MVPs and the 1954 World Series. He was selected to 24 all-star teams and elected to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nHe is widely considered one of if not the greatest players to ever play baseball, nonetheless the Giants. While he was not expected to attend Thursday's game due to his health, the baseball world hoped Mays would see the appreciation baseball fans had for him.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants (36-39) will hope to honor Mays, a team legend, with a victory Thursday night against the St. Louis Cardinals (36-37). Both teams are below .500 and on two-game losing streaks. Just one game will be played at Rickwood, before the two travel to St. Louis to wrap up the three-game series on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nKeaton Winn (3-7) will take the mound for the Giants and square off against the Cardinals' Andre Pallante (2-3). The Cardinals had the best record in the National League over its past 27 games, before losing two of three games in Miami.\n\nBoth teams are wearing commemorative jerseys honoring the Negro League teams of each city: the San Francisco Sea Lions and the St. Louis Stars. The Giants and the Cardinals have both stitched patches with the No. 24 in black and orange to honor Mays tonight.\n\nThe Cardinals filmed a video in the pre-season in which players described what Mays meant to baseball and their anticipation to play at Rickwood Field.\n\n\"The ability [of Mays] to break those barriers is amazing,\" Cardinals utility player Brendan Donovan said. \"I'm actually from Alabama so I know all about Rickwood Field. It's truly special to get to play here.\"\n\n\"Obviously one of the biggest names in baseball history,\" Cardinals shortstop Masyn Winn said. \"You hear a name like that you think Hank Aaron, Ozzie Smith, Jackie Robinson and all those Black legends. Super excited to be a part of that history.\"\n\nRickwood Field is the oldest professional baseball field that is still operative in the United States. Once a playing fortress for 30% of MLB Hall of Famers, the field has been used for special occasions such as Thursday night's game but also as a filming site for 42, which displays the career of Jackie Robinson.\n\nFirst pitch is set for 6:15 p.m. and will be broadcast nationally on Fox. It is the first time an MLB game will be played in Alabama.", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The event, announced last year, marks MLB's first competition at a historic Negro Leagues field and extends a recent run of U.S.-based games held at nontraditional locations, including the Field of Dreams movie site in Iowa, the Little League complex in Pennsylvania, Fort Liberty in North Carolina, and the College World Series site in Nebraska.\n\nWillie Mays (above), one of the foremost icons of baseball, played as a teenager at Rickwood, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. When the game was first scheduled, part of the idea was to celebrate the Hall of Famer. But he issued a statement Monday saying he would not be able to travel from California to Alabama. The following day, he died at the age of 93 of heart failure. Mays's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque is on display at Rickwood, a move planned before his death, and memorializing his legacy will be a central part of both the in-venue game operations and the national broadcast coverage on Fox.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nThe Rickwood game required an extensive overhaul by MLB and field consultant BrightView, stretching more than a year, to bring the aging facility up to league code for a regular-season game. The event is also the centerpiece of a much larger recognition by MLB of the often-overlooked contribution of the Negro Leagues to baseball. Last month, the league formally incorporated former Negro Leagues players into its official statistics, allowing players who were banned from MLB due to segregation to be considered in the same way as white players.\n\nSince the history and statistics of baseball are integral to the overall fandom and culture of the sport, a move such as this arguably resonates much more than if it happened elsewhere. This also likely will have significant impacts on future inductions to the Hall of Fame, which also can produce a sizable influx of income for those players and the Cooperstown, N.Y., shrine itself.\n\nThe Hall of Fame has also been an active participant in the broader commemoration, recently holding its Hall of Fame East-West Classic, a tribute to the Negro Leagues East-West All-Star Game that ran annually from 1933 to '62.\n\nMLB, meanwhile, continues to push for greater diversity, both on the field and off. Black people comprise 6% of major league rosters, down from 18% 30 years ago, and standing at the lowest level since the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport began tracking this data in the early 1990s.\n\nBut people of color such as the Yankees' Aaron Judge and Dodgers' Mookie Betts represent some of the sport's biggest stars. Recent draft classes have also shown greater percentages of Black people, suggesting improvement to come at the major league level in future years.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com",

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday.

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nThe setting will be Rickwood, which opened in 1910 and not only is the oldest facility still operating in baseball but has rich ties to the Negro Leagues as it was the home of the Black Barons.\n\n\"Willie Mays took his all-around brilliance from the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League to the historic Giants franchise,\" Manfred added. \"From coast to coast in New York and San Francisco, Willie inspired generations of players and fans as the game grew and truly earned its place as our National Pastime.\"\n\nThe evening is being called \"MLB at Rickwood Field: A tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" and the coverage on Fox (KTVI, Channel 2 locally) begins at 4:30 p.m. with the first pitch scheduled for 6:15 p.m. The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nMLB Network will be carrying shows from Rickwood throughout the day. At noon, \"MLB Central\" airs, followed at 1:30 by a celebrity softball game. At 3 o'clock is \"MLB Tonight,\" which is hosted by St. Charles native Greg Amsinger and has former Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright among the analysts. \"MLB Tonight\" then returns after the game.\n\nOn radio, Cardinals broadcasters John Rooney, Ricky Horton and Mike Claiborne are to be on hand and pregame programming begins at 5:20 p.m. In addition to KMOX (1120 AM) and the team's regular radio network, the contest will air locally on WFUN (96.3 FM), a rhythm and blues station owned by KMOX parent company Audacy.\n\nCardinals Spanish-language broadcasters Polo Ascencio and Bengie Molina also will call the game, albeit via monitors in Busch Stadium. That airs locally on WIJR (880 AM), the rest of the team's Spanish network plus on Sirius XM Radio.", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"},

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\nLocations Stlouis Be the first to

Concession stands featuring Southern cuisine -- hot chicken and barbecue included, obviously -- lined the concourse leading to the ballpark's main entrance. Large billboards planted to the left of Rickwood Field's famed green walls provided history lessons, summarizing the impact of the Negro Leagues and how those players helped propel Major League Baseball to new heights. One sign in particular stood out, a quote from Buck O'Neil, a first baseman and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs.\n\n\"Don't feel sorry for the Black baseball player. Feel sorry for the ones who didn't get to see them play.\"\n\nMLB's Negro Leagues tribute game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals will take place Thursday evening, but the party in Birmingham is well underway. On Wednesday afternoon, former MLB stars ranging from Barry Bonds to David Ortiz to CC Sabathia to Derek Jeter gathered on the field ahead of a celebrity softball game designed to celebrate Juneteenth. The event featured prominent former and professional athletes from other sports, such as Najee Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers, three-time Pro Bowler Dez Bryant, former NBA players Eric Bledsoe and Matt Barnes and NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens. Actors Omari Hardwick and Kel Mitchell also headlined the contest.\n\nFor many fans, attending any sporting event at Rickwood Field -- the oldest ballpark in the country -- was well worth the cost of admission. For Sabathia, it's a vision that came to fruition. He was a driving force in establishing MLB's tribute to the Negro Leagues and a leading proponent of providing top-tier upkeep at Rickwood Field in advance of the event.\n\n\"It means a lot to be able to see this field,\" Sabathia said. \"This is a dream of mine and a lot of people that understand what this field means for Black baseball. Without this field, a lot of us -- none of us -- would be playing the game. This field, I always say, is the birth of Black baseball.\"\n\nOne of the purposes of the Rickwood Field game was to recognize the greats who played in the Negro Leagues. That includes Willie Mays, an Alabama native who began his professional career as a teenager with the Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. Mays died at the age of 93 on Tuesday, a day after releasing a statement explaining that he wouldn't be able to attend the game but was looking forward to watching from home.\n\nThe news of Mays' death rocked baseball, with tributes and acknowledgments flowing in from across the sport. But the National Baseball Hall of Fame ensured Mays would be present in some form. President Josh Rawitch traveled to Birmingham from Cooperstown with Mays' Hall of Fame plaque in tow on Wednesday morning. Minutes after gates opened to the public, a line began forming outside the stadium's pop-up museum where the plaque was displayed for most of the afternoon. It marked the first time Mays' plaque was brought to an event outside the Hall of Fame since he was enshrined in 1979.\n\n\"We had been talking about (bringing the plaque) for probably three, four months,\" Rawitch said. \"It certainly wasn't tied in any way to his passing. We were all really excited at the idea that this plaque could be here.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who have never been to Cooperstown, who when we bring plaques on the road, this is their chance to get a taste of it,\" he added. \"It's always incredibly popular when we bring any plaque outside. But obviously under these circumstances, as soon as we had the stand set up and the plaque on it, people were lined up -- and it's going to be that way for the next two days.\"\n\nMays' plaque was also displayed on the field before Wednesday's celebrity softball game, where various athletes paid their respects. A moment of silence was held before the start of the game. Major League Baseball plans to honor Mays ahead of Thursday's game as well.\n\n\"Anybody who loves this game loves Willie Mays,\" Rawitch said. \"I don't know that there's a more fitting place for this plaque to be than right here right now.\"\n\nDexter Fowler was slated to only coach in Wednesday's softball game, not play. He did provide a disclaimer though.\n\n\"If Barry (Bonds) says I have to hit, I have to hit,\" he laughed.\n\nBonds was the coach of the Say Heys, named of course after his godfather. The other team was dubbed the Hammers as a nod to Hank Aaron. Fowler was among many former major leaguers who considered this week a must-attend event.\n\n\"It's great to be here, especially honoring Hank Aaron and Willie Mays,\" Fowler said. \"I believe it gives awareness because now people will look up what the Negro Leagues did and how important it was to the game.\"\n\n\"It's a special moment to have everybody come out here, especially for a great cause, to celebrate the greats.\"\n\nAdam Jones echoed those sentiments, offering effusive praise for Sabathia and MLB in ensuring the event took place.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" Jones said. \"The initiative from CC and the commissioner's office, the (Birmingham residents). Tireless work from countless people. ... Seeing pictures from before and after, talking to people from before and after who were on the ground, making sure this field got into tip-top shape, they just made the space unbelievable. But the initiatives that we're trying to do and celebrate the Negro Leagues are fantastic. Obviously in baseball history and American history, African Americans are a big part of it. To be recognized, it's amazing.\"\n\nBoth Fowler and Jones were stunned to hear of Mays' passing the night prior. Fowler was inside a building named in honor of Mays at the time of the announcement, and called the feeling \"surreal.\"\n\nJones hopes Thursday's game will honor Mays accordingly. He has a clear idea of what he hopes that will look like.\n\n\"Obviously we're sad about his passing,\" Jones said, \"but I think we should honor and celebrate his life by having a great time here and do what Mr. Mays would do: Play the game hard, have some fun and hopefully entertain the crowd.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

It was long the home park of the now-Double-A Birmingham Barons, but more notably, was the base for the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues.\n\nIt holds enormous significance in the baseball stories of many who were forbidden to play in the segregated game prior to Jackie Robinson's debut in 1947 and for many long, hard years after.\n\n\"I'm super excited that I get to be a part of it and this team gets to be a part of it,\" said Cardinals shortstop Masyn Winn, who is at present the only Black player on the Cardinals' active roster. \"Me and my stepdad have been talking about it since spring training. He's super excited to be out there. To be able to share this moment with him and with this team is going to be pretty fun.\"\n\nWhen Winn was young, his stepfather, Earl Luckett, would recruit players from underprivileged areas of Houston for weekend games which resembled in some ways the barnstorming professional teams which dominated decades of action in the Negro Leagues. Each weekend, the players assembled would take the field wearing jerseys with the names of Negro League stars on the back rather than their own, and Luckett would ask the players to present facts about those stars to the group as a way of preserving the legacy and knowledge of Black baseball that MLB is now increasing efforts to support.\n\n\"I grew up in a suburb, [played for] a nice little select team, but he put together a team full of Black players,\" Winn said. \"We'd wear Satchel Paige, Cool Papa Bell, guys like that on our backs...Super important to me to be able to play on the same field a lot of those guys played on.\"\n\nIt's also notable, for all the wrong reasons, that Winn is likely to be the only Black player to appear in the game on Thursday. Giants starter - and former Cardinal - Jordan Hicks is lined up to pitch over the weekend at Busch Stadium, and Giants first baseman LaMonte Wade, Jr. is currently on the injured list.\n\nThe week, though, will feature myriad events designed to celebrate both Juneteenth and the history of the Negro Leagues. On Wednesday night, a celebrity softball game called Barnstorm Birmingham will take place, with legendary big leaguers Barry Bonds and Derek Jeter named the honorary captains of the two teams -- The Hammers, named after Alabama native Henry Aaron, and the Say Heys, named in honor of Birmingham's own Willie Mays.\n\nThere was hope that Mays would be able to attend the game played by his most notable team and at the ballpark where he grew up falling in love with baseball through the Barons, but it was announced over the weekend that he would not attend due to health concerns and he died Tuesday at age 93.\n\nMays' son, Michael, has been involved in promotional activities around the game, and his godson, Bonds, will largely act in his stead.\n\nMore than three dozen retired players and celebrities are expected to be in attendance for the festivities, including former Cardinal Dexter Fowler and St. Louis natives Ryan Howard and Metro Boomin.\n\nThe game also holds significance for those who grew up in the area without easy access to Major League Baseball. Though there's a significant limit on the number of tickets which were on sale to the public, Cardinals utility player Brendan Donovan largely grew up in the state while being raised in a military family, and has a special appreciation for the chance to play in front of his family on native soil.\n\n\"You have the Biscuits in Montgomery,\" Donovan said, \"but you don't have a major team really anywhere in Alabama. So that's kind of cool.\"\n\nBoth his and his wife's family will be in attendance, though he joked that it's been easier to get them to come together for games since the two had their first baby in spring. Still, the game is a chance for him to represent a place that's meaningful, even if that's in a different form than its historical context.\n\nMLB's investment in Rickwood Field is designed to outlast the week's activities, hopefully remaining a viable surface for under-served communities to use for years to come. Through the integration of Negro League statistics into the league's historical record as well as the ongoing support of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, the league has taken significant, important steps on that front which now is left to be translated into action in communities.\n\n\"We want to make baseball look cool for the Black community,\" Winn said of himself and outfielder Jordan Walker, currently with Triple-A Memphis. \"I wish there were more Black players out there to represent, but to be able to be out there and be an inspiration for younger kids is pretty cool to me.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_jones@bnd.com", "name": "Jeff Jones", "type": "author",

The event, announced last year, marks MLB's first competition at a historic Negro Leagues field and extends a recent run of U.S.-based games held at nontraditional locations, including the Field of Dreams movie site in Iowa, the Little League complex in Pennsylvania, Fort Liberty in North Carolina, and the College World Series site in Nebraska.\n\nWillie Mays (above), one of the foremost icons of baseball, played as a teenager at Rickwood, the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S. When the game was first scheduled, part of the idea was to celebrate the Hall of Famer. But he issued a statement Monday saying he would not be able to travel from California to Alabama. The following day, he died at the age of 93 of heart failure. Mays's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque is on display at Rickwood, a move planned before his death, and memorializing his legacy will be a central part of both the in-venue game operations and the national broadcast coverage on Fox.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nThe Rickwood game required an extensive overhaul by MLB and field consultant BrightView, stretching more than a year, to bring the aging facility up to league code for a big league game. The event is also the centerpiece of a much larger recognition by MLB of the often-overlooked contribution of the Negro Leagues to baseball. Last month, the league formally incorporated former Negro Leagues players into its official statistics, allowing players who were banned from MLB due to segregation to be considered in the same way as white players.\n\nSince the history and statistics of baseball are integral to the overall fandom and culture of the sport, a move such as this arguably resonates much more than if it happened elsewhere. This also likely will have significant impacts on future inductions to the Hall of Fame, which also can produce a sizable influx of income for those players and the Cooperstown, N.Y., shrine itself.\n\nThe Hall of Fame has also been an active participant in the broader commemoration, recently holding its Hall of Fame East-West Classic, a tribute to the Negro Leagues East-West All-Star Game that ran annually from 1933 to '62.\n\nMLB, meanwhile, continues to push for greater diversity, both on the field and off. Black people comprise 6% of major league rosters, down from 18% 30 years ago, and standing at the lowest level since the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport began tracking this data in the early 1990s.\n\nBut people of color such as the Yankees' Aaron Judge and Dodgers' Mookie Betts represent some of the sport's biggest stars. Recent draft classes have also shown greater percentages of Black people, suggesting improvement to come at the major league level in future years.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com",

Both teams were wearing Negro League jerseys with the Barons in the Birmingham Black Barons uniforms, who called Rickwood home from 1924 to 1960.\n\nFormer Rebels Jacob Gonzalez and Tim Elko were part of this historic moment as their Birmingham Barons competed on MLB Network in front of a national audience.\n\nGonzalez finished the night 0-for-3 with an RBI sac fly and a walk while Elko went 1-for-4 with a nice line drive single. Both players are having a great year so far in Double A, as they are both hitting over .300 before the break in the Southern League.\n\nThe Barons are in first place in the North Division of the Southern League, and both Elko and Gonzo have carved out nice roles with the club as their climb up the Minor League ranks continues.\n\nOn the Major League side of things, the parent club of the Barons, the Chicago White Sox, are on pace for one of the worst seasons in MLB history. The South Side Sox will have some decisions to make as their season seems to be over before the trade deadline.\n\nExpect the Sox to be sellers, which could mean call-ups to the show. Gonzalez isn't the top-ranked shortstop for the White Sox, but his versatility to play both positions up the middle is definitely something to look for in the future. Elko started with the Big League club during spring training but was optioned back to Birmingham after a hot start in Arizona fizzled.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But he died Tuesday, thus shifting the focus of the events.\n\n\"Thursday's game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.\"\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nOther coverage\n\nMLB Network will be carrying shows from Rickwood throughout the day. At noon, \"MLB Central\" airs, followed at 1:30 by a celebrity softball game. At 3 o'clock is \"MLB Tonight,\" which is hosted by St. Charles native Greg Amsinger and has former Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright among the analysts. \"MLB Tonight\" then returns after the game.\n\nOn radio, Cardinals broadcasters John Rooney, Ricky Horton and Mike Claiborne are to be on hand and pregame programming begins at 5:20 p.m. In addition to KMOX (1120 AM) and the team's regular radio network, the contest will air locally on WFUN (96.3 FM), a rhythm and blues station owned by KMOX parent company Audacy.\n\nCardinals Spanish-language broadcasters Polo Ascencio and Bengie Molina also will call the game, albeit via monitors in Busch Stadium. That airs locally on WIJR (880 AM), the rest of the team's Spanish network plus on Sirius XM Radio.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis

It had been opened in 1910 as the home of the Birmingham Barons and has been home to several teams over the years, including the spring training home of the Phillies and Pirates at points, but the Black Barons called it home the longest from 1920-60.\n\nIt was picked as the site for a game between the two MLB teams in 2024 to honor the Negro Leagues around Juneteenth. Playing in the stadium won't be the only way Major League Baseball honors the Negro Leagues.\n\nThe teams will wear special jerseys that honor Negro Leagues teams that, at points, came to play the Black Barons at Rickwood Field.\n\nThe Giants are going to be wearing the uniforms of the San Francisco Sea Lions. The Sea Lions were a Negro League team in 1946, but the West Coast Negro Baseball League folded after only one year. The Sea Lions continued to play as a barnstorming league for a while after the league folded.\n\nFans might notice what appears to be a bear cub on the front of the jersey and on the hat. That is not a mistake. The Sea Lions featured a bear cub on the jersey because the uniforms were recycled from the San Francisco Cubs, a former baseball team.\n\nMAYS: Stats | Best moments | Nickname | Basket catch\n\nThe Sea Lions have been represented on throwback jerseys by the Giants in the past, including in 2023.\n\nThe Cardinals will be wearing the jerseys of the St. Louis Stars. The Stars were a Negro League team that began as an independent team from 1906-19, then joined the Negro National League in 1920, playing there through 1931.\n\nThe team won three pennants, coming in first in three of the past four years it was in the league (1928, 1930, 1931), though the final pennant came when the Negro National League folded midway through the year.\n\nThere was another Stars team that played in the Negro American League in 1937, but it disbanded after the campaign. Another attempt to revive the team came in 1939, but it lasted only until 1943. That latter edition was called the St. Louis-New Orleans-Harrisburg Stars, as it was combined between all three teams.\n\nThe jerseys will read simply, \"St. Louis\" across the front. The hat has the STL abbreviation with the T smaller than the other letters and underlined.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Negro_Baseball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast Negro Baseball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Sea_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Sea Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Stars_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Stars (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_National_League_(1920\u201331)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negro National League (1920\u201331)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negro American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennant (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-2157653083.jpg?itok=ZUGXtHNh", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The network plans to go all out with its telecast in focusing on the historical aspect of the event as well as the game itself. While Mays tributes being shown are a given, exact plans for some coverage was in flux late Wednesday because of his death.\n\nFox is treating the event like it would a World Series game, with its lead announcers set to call the game: Joe Davis (play-by-play) and John Smoltz (commentary). It also has its postseason pregame show crew on hand: Kevin Burkhardt as the host with commentary from Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz.\n\nOscar- and Grammy-winning artist Jon Batiste is to present a pregame musical tribute to the Negro Leagues, in which approximately 60 of its former players are scheduled to be on the field at approximately 6 p.m. Then the ceremonial first pitch is to be delivered by Bill Greason, a 99-year-old Negro Leagues alumnus who in 1954 was the Cardinals' first Black pitcher. He since has been a pastor in Birmingham.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will be wearing throwback uniforms representing Negro League teams that played in their cities -- the St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nIt sets up for a memorable night.\n\n'Spectacular' look\n\n\"It's going to look spectacular\" on TV, Fox Sports Vice President of Field Operations and Engineering Brad Cheney told the Post-Dispatch, adding that the network will unfurl \"postseason technology\" for the telecast.\n\nTo that end, more than 20 cameras and in excess of 45 microphones will be positioned throughout the ballpark that will have a seating capacity of about 8,300 for the contest.\n\n\"Small stadiums have different sound\" than big league facilities, Cheney said, so Fox wants to relay that.\n\nThe production folks also are eager to show shots of players and plays that will be tighter in the quaint setting compared to an MLB stadium.\n\n\"We'll be close to the players,\" he said.\n\nThis event long has been on the drawing board, with talks beginning three years ago. Cheney said Fox officials made six trips to the facility from the start of the planning stages through the period when modifications were being made to the ballpark to accommodate the network's production as well as a big league game. He estimates that more than 12,000 man-hours have been spread across 270 people \"to bring this event to life.\"\n\nFox and MLB have tried to not be too disruptive. Despite the construction, Cheney said people who attended a game at Rickwood before the updates began should not notice any difference when looking at the field on Thursday. There was a minor league game played there Tuesday, giving organizers a couple of days to take care of any unexpected problems that arose before the main event arrives.\n\n\"It's been a very big undertaking,\" Cheney said, adding that he has been on-site since Friday. \"It's a large departure from normal, creating an event from the ground up.\"\n\nFox has had experience on the baseball front with starting from scratch, having televised games from the \"Field of Dreams\" in Dyersville, Iowa, in 2021 and '22. That was the setting of the 1989 film by that name.\n\nThat experience helps, but there also is a caveat.\n\n\"More challenging is that the stadium is here,\" he said. \"With the 'Field of Dreams,' we built the stadium from the ground up\" to its own specifications.\n\nDan Caesar - 314-340-8175\n\n@caesardan on X (formerly Twitter)\n\ndcaesar@post-dispatch.com\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

This is the team with whom Willie Mays made his professional debut in 1948 at age 17. The game was already scheduled to honor the Negro Leagues and the impact they had on American professional baseball, but then Mays died earlier this week and now the game has a feeling of greater significance. It'll air nationally on Fox. Here are the pertinent details.\n\nGiants vs. Cardinals\n\nDate: Thursday, June 20 | Time: 7:15 p.m. ET\n\nLocation: Rickwood Field (Birmingham, Ala.)\n\nLive stream: Fubo (try for free), MLB.TV | TV: Fox (National)\n\nProbable pitchers: RHP Keaton Winn (3-7, 6.66) vs. RHP Andre Pallante (2-3, 4.61)\n\nOdds: SF -115 | STL -105; over/under: 9.0 (via Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nStorylines\n\nGiants: The Giants come in having lost four of six and one of those wins needed a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth. They have been inconsistent and overall not very good, though the 36-39 record right now means they are only one game out of the third NL wild-card spot. Winn closed April with three very good starts, but has a 13.02 ERA in five starts since. He did have a quality start last time out, but three runs allowed in six innings against the Angels is hardly overly encouraging.\n\nCardinals: The Cardinals recently played good enough baseball to rise above .500 for the first time since they were 5-4, but they've since lost two straight to the lowly Marlins, both in walk-off fashion. Sitting 36-37, they trail the Brewers by 7.5 games in the NL Central, but that's good enough in this National League for second place and the second wild-card (they are tied with the Nationals, occupying the second and third spots). Pallante was a reliever to begin the year and has only now made four starts, averaging 4 1/3 innings per start with a 3.63 ERA. He only threw 59 pitches last time out, but the bullpen got worked awfully hard in Miami with an extra-inning win and two late losses.\n\nPrediction\n\nFirst off, MLB is going to put together a pre-game video package to honor not only the Negro Leagues but also Mays. The best bet is they'll do an excellent job with at least the Mays one, probably both.\n\nAs far as the game itself, it kind of takes a back seat at this point, rightfully, but there are plenty of reasons to watch.\n\nIt's extremely hot, which means the ball will carry. We have no idea how this ballpark will play, obviously, but I'm betting on a slugfest.\n\nGiants 8, Cardinals 7", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_snyder@cbssports.com", "name": "Matt Snyder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negro American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/20/41310374-0fb5-4373-8772-a10a57d50084/thumbnail/1200x675/6f16b0f01440cc4b6dcf77e2e03929df/rickwood-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 648, "textEnd": 655}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

He was standing outside a small museum underneath the stands, where the next day fans would line up to see Mays's flower-draped Hall of Fame plaque, the first time it has left the wall in Cooperstown since it was installed at his induction in 1979. \"I have chill bumps. I can't think of any place to be than here.\"\n\nAt 114 years old, Rickwood Field is the nation's oldest professional ballpark, the first place Mays played pro ball and the last ballpark still standing that he called home. To honor the legacy of the Negro Leagues, Major League Baseball scheduled a game in Mays's hometown between the San Francisco Giants, Mays's old team, and the St. Louis Cardinals, that will be played on Thursday.\n\nThe Rev.

I will be there with my son Sam and it will be the fullest of full circle moments in my love of baseball.\n\nI first laid eyes on Rickwood Field in 1969 when my Dad, the original Sam Malone, took me to my first professional game at Rickwood. It was love at first sight. I could not get over how green everything was and the giant scoreboard immediately grabbed my attention.\n\nLater in that summer, on August 30, 1969, my Dad took me to my first major league game which featured the Chicago Cubs against the Atlanta Braves at Fulton County Stadium. Wouldn't you know it but Hank Aaron homered that day, the 547th of his storied career, and my love of baseball exploded.\n\nDuring my childhood years, my Dad and I attended 15 to 20 games a season at Rickwood where we saw the Birmingham A's play in the Double AA Southern League. I couldn't get enough of the place. I probably asked my Dad every day during the summer: \"Dad, when are we going to our next game at Rickwood!?\"\n\nDuring those trips to games at Rickwood my Dad would tell me about the rich history of the ballpark and the many iconic players who had played there, most notably the great -- now late -- Willie Mays of Fairfield, Alabama. It was a Who's Who of all-time baseball greats.\n\nIn the early 1970s, major league teams frequently played spring training games at Rickwood as they headed north. In 1971, on back-to-back nights at Rickwood, I saw games featuring the Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, and Washington Senators. What a thrill it was as a nine-year-old to see all-time greats such as Hank Aaron, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski. Before these games -- in something you would never see today -- children were allowed to be on the field unsupervised to obtain autographs. In an incredible stroke of fortune, I was able to get the autograph of Ted Williams, the last major leaguer to hit .400 and who was then the manager of the Senators. I still have that autograph and another program from those 1971 Spring Training games at Rickwood.\n\nI played baseball for Mountain Brook High School from 1977 to 1979 as a catcher. In what seemed like a bad break in 1978, but now seems serendipitous, our home field was being renovated in 1978 so my Spartans had the wonderful luck of playing three \"home\" games at Rickwood against our biggest rivals, Shades Valley, Homewood, and Vestavia.\n\nTo be able to play on the same field where all-time greats like Willie Mays and Hank Aaron played was the thrill of a lifetime. Vestavia, as they regularly did, beat us. We won our other two games at Rickwood against Homewood and Shades Valley with the win against Shades Valley being the only one I remember us having against the Mountaineers in my three years at Mountain Brook.\n\nOne thing a catcher always does is check out the distance from home plate to the back stop. At Rickwood that distance was quite large, at least 20 yards. I desperately did not want any balls to get by me and have to make that sprint to the distant backstop with a runner hightailing it around the bases. Thankfully, none did.\n\nMy Spartan teammates will attest I was not a very good hitter but, for some reason, I hit well at Rickwood, going six for eight there, including three for three versus Homewood. My only explanation for my \"hitting spree\" is that I was inspired by Rickwood history.\n\nThose many games my Dad and I attended at Rickwood when I was a kid were some of the best times of my life. It was just the two of us spending time together, talking about baseball and life, in that order.\n\nMy Dad lived a full and meaningful life, passing at age 90. During one of Dad's last outings before he had to move into a nursing home, he, my son Sam, and I went out for a drive after Thanksgiving. We went by Legion Field and laughed and smiled about the many great times we had there and grimaced about some results you never get over. Our last stop of that day was at Rickwood Field, where we sat and talked about how special our times at Rickwood had been.\n\nWhen MLB announced it was going to play a regular season game in Iowa at the \"Field of Dreams,\" I immediately thought to myself, \"Wouldn't it be something if they played a game at Rickwood one day?\"\n\nNow, that incredible day is here.\n\nThank you to the Friends of Rickwood for preserving Rickwood against the odds to make this possible. A special thanks to Coke Matthews, Gerald Watkins, Jr., and David Wininger for their efforts.\n\nSo, on June 20, 2024, my son Sam and I will travel to Birmingham for this phenomenal\n\ncelebration of the Negro Leagues and Rickwood Field. I will give thanks to be at Rickwood with my son and for the blessings that allowed me to have so many wonderful times with my Dad at Rickwood.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news",

Overflowing crowds of Black fans packed Rickwood Field, the local ballpark, when the Birmingham Black Barons played, and on Sundays church would let out early so worshipers could watch baseball.\n\nThat is largely a bygone era.\n\n\"I don't think they know anything about Black baseball as such,\" said Charles Willis, 92, a high school teammate of Mays who played one season for the Black Barons, referring to Black children in Birmingham today. \"Because nowadays, Black kids don't play baseball.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball went to Rickwood this week as a tribute to the history of the Negro Leagues, a celebration that will now encompass a memorial service for Mays, who died on Tuesday at 93. The celebration, concluding on Thursday evening with a regular-season game between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals, is largely about honoring the past. But it is also about looking ahead, wrestling with how to attract young African American athletes to play baseball at a time when African American representation in the sport has diminished.\n\n\"The biggest thing that excites me is that we are discussing baseball again in the Black community,\" Nelson George, a filmmaker who produced the 2022 documentary \"Say Hey, Willie Mays!\", said this week. \"Because, let's be frank, baseball has fallen out. The generation of Hank Aaron and Willie Mays and Bob Gibson, these were all-stars and the equivalent of Lebron -- to any N.F.L. player.\"\n\nWhile still broadly popular, baseball has struggled in recent years to maintain its once tight grip on the national consciousness. As football and basketball have risen, baseball's slower pace and reliance on nostalgia have threatened to make it seem less cool to younger American sports fans.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hank Aaron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/20/multimedia/20nat-baseball-race-lvmp/20nat-baseball-race-lvmp-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Rickwood Field, known as one of the oldest professional ballpark in the United States and former home of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, will be the site of a special regular season game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on June 20, 2024.\n\nDerrick Goold St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nWhen the Cardinals step over the chalk line and walk into history at Rickwood Field in the first inning Thursday night, they follow the footprints of giants in their game, they run basepaths blazed by Negro League pioneers and all-time greats, and they do so with the tailwind of recent landmark decisions that assert they are not the first Major League players to take that field.\n\nA confluence of events meets in Birmingham, Alabama, when the Cardinals and San Francisco Giants play Major League Baseball's Tribute to the Negro Leagues game at Rickwood, the oldest professional ballpark in the United States.\n\nThe game comes within weeks of Major League Baseball rewriting the all-time leaders by embracing into its records the statistics from Negro Leagues that existed from 1920 to 1948. That announcement, made in late May, vaulted legendary player Josh Gibson's .372 career batting average ahead of the title's long-time owner, Ty Cobb. Gibson's .466 average in 1943 is now the single-season record.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And it came just weeks after the National Baseball Hall of Fame opened its exhibit, \"The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball,\" and celebrated it by hosting the East-West Classic, an exhibition tribute to the Negro Leagues All-Star Game that featured retired MLB players like Ozzie Smith and Ryan Howard.\n\nGerald Early, the Merle Kling Professor of Modern Letters in Arts & Sciences at Washington University, is a lifelong baseball fan and author who was a curatorial consultant on the exhibit in Cooperstown, New York. He was asked what it means to have all of these events, though not officially connected, come together.\n\n\"If you want to have a larger theme -- it's all about reconciliation,\" Early said. \"This country's past has been marred by segregation and racism, and to have these things happening as they are I think is a great thing as far as coming to grips with our history. It is a very good thing that Major League Baseball is creating this recognition -- this well-earned recognition. ... All of these things coming together are a way for us as Americans to learn our history, to learn to live with this history, and by learning make us better.\"\n\nEarly's forthcoming book, \"Play Harder: The Triumph of Black Baseball in America,\" will be published next spring in association with the Hall's exhibit. Early was approached by the Hall to help create the exhibit, one of the most technologically modern at the Hall.\n\nWork began in June 2022 for a group that included former players, Hall of Famers, historians and others, and it often took Early to Cooperstown. The exhibit includes artifacts like Cool Papa Bell's cleats. To tell the stories beyond the items, Early and others mined quotes from players, owners, fans, newspaper coverage and writers because he felt it was important to give voice to the history.\n\nThe Post-Dispatch spoke with Early recently about the exhibit, his book, the Rickwood game and more, with all these historic threads coming together to strengthen the connection between today's game and all the leagues that helped create it. The conversation is published here in chronological order, with the exception of the above quote, and it is edited only for length and clarity.\n\nQuestion: When you described going beyond the stats and artifacts to sharing a \"view of baseball\" and its cultural significance in the exhibit, could you expound on that goal?\n\nAnswer: Baseball is a game that has meaning for people who are hardcore fans of the performance, of the players, of the performance of the teams. But baseball has a wider significance to the culture, a wider significance to our country beyond the fans. It means something to people who are not even fans. That is what I mean by a larger kind of story, or a larger kind of view.\n\nWhat does this game mean to the country itself?\n\nWhat does it mean to people who have no engagement with this game, and how has this game affected the country? Because this game has affected the country beyond the people who follow it.\n\nI wanted to make sure that story got in there. Particularly for the Black people playing baseball because Black people played baseball for a long time under a certain kind of duress, you might say, a set of disadvantages. And that means something that the game was that important to a minority group of people to want to be engaged in this game and to play this game with the persistence that they do.\n\nQ: And that is true for so many, from players, fans, to owners ...\n\nA: Yes, it goes beyond the players. It goes to the owners who wanted this to happen. It goes to the Black press that was supporting it and promoting it. It goes to other Black businesses in the Black community that were also promoting it and supporting it and trying to create a fan base for the game. The fact that they were able to work these elements to bring (the Negro Leagues) about is a very impressive story. I think it's a story that all Americans -- it shouldn't matter what race you are -- all Americans should be proud of that.\n\nThat this game meant that much to these people to put that amount of effort in.\n\nQ: How does the exhibit share that?\n\nA: The exhibit does it by zeroing in on certain personalities connected to the game so that you get a sense of the people who were important to the game. Of course, Jackie Robinson, obviously, but also people like Effa Manley (Newark Eagles' owner and Hall of Famer), and earlier people like Rube Foster (Hall of Famer nicknamed the 'Father of Black baseball'), Bud Fowler (groundbreaking player in 19th century and Hall of Famer). The commitment by these people to want to play and want to organize -- that's the key word. They wanted to organize something.\n\nQ: The title of your upcoming book, 'Play Harder,' comes from a description Leon Wagner (a Cardinals outfielder in 1960) gave for how he reacted in the minors to racism and threats. Why choose that phrase?\n\nA: That expression, 'play harder,' was something in my research I discovered many Black players said this. They felt they had a certain kind of challenge, of having to prove themselves to play this game. Which is why the saying of 'play harder' became almost a motto among people. The inspiring thing about this is people didn't let the adversities stop them. They just said, 'OK, fine. I'm going to go harder to overcome.' I think it's a story that is actually inspiring in that way.\n\nQ: When you discuss how baseball's history is far-reaching beyond players and fans of the game, you have used the word 'citizenship' -- if you're a part of the national pastime, it's a way to be a part of the nation. Am I saying that right?\n\nA: I think that's pretty much the point. Black people wanted to play the game because they liked the game and felt here is a way for us to show we're Americans, to show we are a part of the nation, that we're playing this game, and that we're good at playing this game. There was a pride in that to show a mastery of the game. This is the American game, and we're going to show that we can play as well as anyone else. It had a lot to do with citizenship. It had a lot to do with belonging to the nation.\n\nQ: In that way, what does it mean for the Negro Leagues to be, officially, a Major League?\n\nA: One of the reasons why the Negro Leagues started -- Rube Foster got it off the ground -- was they saw it as a proving ground. He said, 'Oh, I'm preparing people who will ultimately play in the major leagues.' The goal was always to get Black players to play in the major leagues.\n\nSo, I think this latest recognition of the Negro Leagues is long overdue, and the Negro Leagues deserve this recognition because they operated under a lot of disadvantages. And they persevered. I believe this recognition of them as a Major League is something that those men and women who were involved in that league -- they're owed that.\n\nIt should make everybody in the country happier to know Black baseball is getting its recognition and Black baseball produced such an excellent product.\n\nQ: The exhibit is a walk through history, Josh Gibson's statistics are historic, but the game at Rickwood is something present -- it will impact this year's standings. How powerful could this event be by highlighting history but then making history on that field with a modern game?\n\nA: That's a good point. It's very important that Major League Baseball is not just having a historic game or a re-creation game. They're having an actual, live game that counts in the standings. It's an important way for Major League Baseball to pay homage to the Negro Leagues as well as to show that, by having the game there, there is a continuity between what happened before and what we have now.\n\nThere is continuity. There is connection.\n\nAnd we're part of a tradition.\n\nWhat happened with the Negro Leagues is part of our traditions with baseball right now. That is important for people to understand, and it makes Major League Baseball that much richer understanding that Negro League baseball is part of its tradition. To have a real game, that's the importance. It makes it a kind of living history. We're not just trying to replicate the past. We're also trying to show this history is part of what we do today.\n\nQ: How did this research, this work, change your relationship with baseball?\n\nA: Well, I was a fan. I always enjoyed baseball. I like baseball a lot. The whole thing with this book and the whole thing of being involved with the exhibit for me was a way of giving back, of showing my appreciation by doing this work and also a way for me to kind of contribute something. It's a small contribution, but I hope that it might have some meaning for people. As I said to people: I have a connection with the Hall of Fame. When I was a kid, I thought I might make the Hall of Fame. I was 8 or 9 and, 'Oh, I'll make the Hall of Fame by being a great baseball player.' Of course, I turned out to not be a great baseball player.\n\nBut to find this connection for the Black players and the ex-players and (have them) show so much appreciation for the exhibit, that is extremely gratifying.\n\nIt's made me feel an even deeper connection to baseball, to feel even more than that -- that baseball is something that's important to our culture. It's done that for me.\n\nQ: I wondered if it's possible researching and telling these stories about baseball, and its flaws, strengthened your fondness, your fandom.\n\nA: Yeah, I think so. I've always gone to games. I was a Cardinals season ticket holder for a while. I've really always enjoyed the game very much. All this research, all this work, all these books by people gave me a deeper appreciation of it.\n\nI'm certainly a more informed fan.\n\nI really think I'm a better fan now.\n\nTipsheet: Tributes

Is it too little, too late?", "body": "As Bob Kendrick, president of the Kansas City-based Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, tells it, baseball's all-time hit king had eyes like Ted Williams and power like Babe Ruth.\n\n\"For me, his greatest feat of all is hitting a ball into the right-field upper deck at Yankee Stadium,\" says Kendrick. \"They say he was circling the bases and just giggling. He was the kind of guy who was so strong that he could poke you in the arm and it would hurt, but he didn't know he was hurting you.\"\n\nThe indomitable Josh Gibson, nicknamed the Black Babe Ruth, managed all this while swinging a bat that measured 40 ounces and 41 inches - about 25% bigger than today's big leagues bats. \"You got to be a man,\" adds Kendrick, \"to swing that kind of lumber.\"\n\nOfficially, Gibson is now the man, after Major League Baseball announced the incorporation of records from the Negro Leagues, even though he never had an at-bat in the majors. The decision late last month to include more than 2,300 players followed a three-year research project, led by a special committee of Negro Leagues experts and statisticians.\n\nRelated: Willie Mays, baseball's towering legend and all-time Giants great, dies aged 93\n\nMLB's new stats database will formally launch before a special tribute game between the St Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday at Alabama's Rickwood Field, home to the Birmingham Black Barons, the team that launched Willie Mays, perhaps the finest player to ever pick up a bat and glove. Until his death on Tuesday at age 93, Mays - AKA the \"Say Hey Kid\" - was one of three surviving Negro Leagues players and baseball's oldest living Hall of Famer. MLB had already planned to pay special tribute Mays at a Negro Leagues commemorative game in absentia.\n\nMLB's statistical integration rights a wrong that had endured since Major League Baseball accepted Black players into its ranks in 1947, precipitating the Negro Leagues' slow death the next year. Why it took nearly 80 years to integrate the stats is a matter of ongoing controversy, with critics accusing MLB of going woke, and some Black baseball fans feeling it all comes far too late in the day. Nevertheless, 77 years since he last swung his bat, Gibson, an imposing catcher and slugger once relegated to the shadows, now stands above the rest.\n\nA gentle giant who loomed large behind the plate, whether crouched in front of the umpire or rolling up his sleeves to show off his massive biceps, Gibson overtook Ty Cobb in career batting average, surpassed Ruth in on-base plus slugging (a prominent advanced stat that measures a hitter's ability to reach base and hit for average and power), and topped Barry Bonds's single-season slugging percentage record, in two different years.\n\nNo US sport is more serious about its stats than baseball. Learned fans call up the most hallowed marks - Hank Aaron's 755 home runs, Pete Rose's 4,256 hits, Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average (ERA), Mays's 660 homers, 339 steals and 7,769 putouts (from centerfield!) - as easily as their own phone numbers. Statistics for Negro Leagues players were just as painstakingly kept among teams and the Black press, which was no mean feat in a league where no set schedule was guaranteed to play out as planned.\n\n\"They had to scramble to keep afloat,\" says John Thorn, the MLB house historian who chaired the 17-person committee that decided baseball's stat integration. \"If they played two or three games in a day and one was a league game and two were against integrated semi-pros, well, it was a paycheck.\" Negro Leagues players barnstormed the country to make ends meet. They were forced into that hustle, adds Thorn, because of \"MLB's racism\".\n\nRelated: 'A story that didn't used to be told': the rise and fall of baseball's Negro Leagues\n\nA 1969 committee on baseball records recognized six major leagues dating to 1876 - but excluded the Negro Leagues \"for no reason\", Thorn says. \"But while settling on those defunct rival leagues as equivalent of the major leagues, the subject of the Negro Leagues' caliber of play was not really much of a question. Everyone agreed it was pretty darn good. That's why I've taken to use the trope of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to describe the attitude toward Black baseball. It wasn't so much racist animus as it was the feeling that they weren't there.\"\n\nThe Negro Leagues weren't just an alternative pastime born from the two Americas that sprang up from segregation. As Sam Pollard shows in his 2023 documentary The League, the Negro Leagues teams were obvious indicators of thriving Black enclaves in major American cities. \"We couldn't go to major league games,\" Pollard told me, \"and if we did, we had to sit isolated, segregated from white audiences. So we created our own Black baseball teams, and that kept money circulating within our stores and funeral homes and the like, helping the community survive.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 2020, when Covid restrictions forced MLB to cut its schedule from 162 games to 60 (the baseline for an average Negro National League season) while making clear that the records generated during that span would be treated the same, that the league announced the integration of Negro League stats to correct \"a longtime oversight\". Over the course of six meetings, Thorn's MLB committee - which included representatives from the Negro Leagues database Seamheads, the MLB play-by-play archive Retrosheet and the Elias Sports Bureau, MLB's official record keeper - pored over decades' worth of game stories and box scores, separating out the inconsistencies among the stats (incongruent wins and losses) and stars (distinguishing among multiple players with the same name).\n\n\"In the end, once we acknowledged that a 60- to 80-game schedule may have been most frequent for Negro Leagues teams, we were able to empty a sliding, variable scale so that although the number of league-scheduled games per league, per team, per annum varied from year to year, what was constant is 3.1 plate appearances per scheduled game (to qualify for batting stats) and one inning pitched per scheduled game to qualify for ERA. Now the very same standards we used for white players we use for Black ones.\"\n\nThorn says the current analysis isn't the final word: \"There will be a version 2.0, and it will be richer than what we have today.\" Still, as overdue as these gestures are, there remains a contingency of Black baseball fans who feel as if this is too little, too late. Baseball stats have already been devalued after a number of players, including some Black players such as Bonds and Sammy Sosa, had their record-setting accomplishments invalidated during baseball's steroid era.\n\nMLB's nod to the Negro Leagues comes as Black American representation in the major leagues is at a historically low ebb. A USA Today study found that 5.7% of players were Black Americans, the lowest percentage since 1955, and that five teams didn't have any Black players. David Justice, a former all-star and World Series champion with the Atlanta Braves, chalks a lot of that up to the high cost of entry.\n\n\"There's this thing called [youth] travel ball,\" Justice explained to Fox Sports' Keyshawn Johnson, a former NFL star who started out playing baseball, \"and it costs a lot of money. A [proper] baseball bat costs $400. And if you don't have the family, you don't have the money. But I can go out here and grab that basketball, and we can go hoop all day.\" Nevertheless, diversity has increased across the league, with Latino representation shooting up from a handful of players in 1948 to nearly 30% of players by opening day 2024.\n\nThe hope is that by finally integrating Gibson and other Negro Leaguers like Buck O'Neil (a Negro Leagues all-star first baseman turned MLB scout and coach) and Norman \"Turkey\" Stearnes (so nicknamed for his waddly flair for rounding the bases) into the official record, fans will connect with this hidden history and fall deeper in love with the game.\n\nSadly, Gibson, the second Black player inducted into baseball's hall of fame, died of a brain tumor-induced stroke at age 35, months before Jackie Robinson broke MLB's color line in 1947. When longtime followers of Black baseball say there were far more talented players in the Negro Leagues than Robinson who could've made that same history, Gibson's name usually comes up first. (Thorn says Branch Rickey, the visionary Dodgers general manager who brought Robinson in, \"wanted someone with a college education\", believing Robinson's years at the University of California at Los Angeles had better prepared him for white society.)\n\nYet in the mind of many baseball fans, Robinson and Gibson don't compare because Gibson, despite stronger numbers, never crossed over to MLB. To Kendrick, that's a bad-faith premise. \"Someone on social media hit me and said: 'Well, we just want to compare apples to apples,'\" says Kendrick. \"No major leaguer ever had to go through what these players in the Negro Leagues had to endure. Never had to worry about where they were going to get a meal, go to sleep. Never had to eat peanut butter and crackers on the bus, or get dressed underneath the stands because they couldn't use the facility in the ballpark, couldn't wash their uniforms. So it can never be apples to apples.\"\n\nFor Cindy Cobb, Ty's granddaughter, the record is straight. \"I envision Turkey and Ty playing together in the outfield,\" Cobb told ESPN. \"Let's never use the color of skin to separate people.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Originally established as the Birmingham Stars in 1920 as one of the first eight teams of the Negro Southern League, they changed their name to the Black Barons. The club joined the Negro National League as an associate member in 1923 and a full member in 1925.\n\nAlabama native and Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays began his professional career as a teenager with the Black Barons in 1948. Mays, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, died Tuesday afternoon at the age of 93.\n\nSome of the other prominent players to wear Black Barons uniforms include Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige and Hall of Fame slugger Mules Suttles.\n\nWinn was 8 years old when his stepfather, Earl Luckett, entered his life. Luckett, who had stint in minor league baseball in the Houston Astros organization in the 1980s, coached and ran amateur baseball teams.\n\n\"We'd wear a different last name on our back every weekend of somebody that played in the Negro League,\" Winn said. \"So for him, it's going to be super-special. For me, it's going to be super-special.

Sunday, we'd have to come and present to the whole team, giving some notes on them and some fun facts about the guys.\"\n\nThe part of the experience that stuck with Winn the most wasn't researching former players. It's the way Luckett made it a point to make baseball available to young Black players who might not have been able to play on travel teams or select squads.\n\n\"A lot of the kids on that team couldn't afford to do some stuff, so my stepdad would sponsor and bring them out,\" Winn said. \"I think just as a collective group, it was pretty good for a lot of those kids, just being able to play baseball with a lot of brothers.

Just the kind of the impact that he had on us.\"\n\nWillie McGee on Willie Mays\n\nCardinals Hall of Famer and coach Willie McGee was born in San Francisco and grew up in the Bay Area when Mays was in the middle of a legendary career with the Giants following their move from New York to San Francisco.\n\nMays earned two National League MVP awards, 12 Gold Gloves, 24 All-Star selections, a batting title and the Rookie of the Year Award in 1951. Mays hit 660 home runs, stole 339 bases and posted a career batting average of .301.\n\nMcGee, a speedy outfielder who won an NL MVP, earned four All-Star selections, three Gold Gloves, a Silver Slugger and a World Series championship, spoke about Mays with great reverence prior to Wednesday's game.\n\n\"He was the greatest player that I ever saw,\" McGee said. \"I always say that he had a sixth tool, the hustle, the aggressiveness and the instincts, especially the way he ran the bases and played defense. There's not many guys who played like that.\"\n\nMcGee, 65, played for the Giants from 1991 to 94. Being a member of the Giants and a native of the Bay area gave McGee the chance to meet and interact with Mays in the middle of his own major league career.\n\nMcGee described Mays as \"fun-loving\" as well as \"humble\" and \"down to earth.\"\n\n\"It was humbling to see that this great player, great guy, one of the greatest players in the world in my book, for him to be the type of person that he was,\" McGee said. \"Most people are better people than they are players, but I can't say that about him. He was so good of a player and a great person. I was thinking about that last night.\"\n\nMcGee was 10 years into his 18-year major league career when he got to San Francisco, but he said he wished he'd been around Mays earlier in his career and been able to pick up even more from Mays.\n\nMcGee still recalls Mays telling and showing him how he didn't stuff his entire hand all the way in his glove. He simply used the pinky finger and thumb to close the glove around the baseball.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors":

Mays played for the San Francisco Giants for most of his career, and they will play against the St. Louis Cardinals tonight. The matchup will be broadcast on FOX at 6:15 p.m. CT. Fans can watch this historic game for free online by using the free trials offered by DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV.\n\nThe atmosphere within the stadium will be electrifying and tickets for the game sold out quickly. Due to the big crowd at Rickwood Field, this game should feel like an MLB playoff game.\n\nREAD MORE: Complete AL.com coverage of Rickwood game\n\nThe Giants have been struggling this season, entering this matchup with a 36-39 record. However, the team will be playing with some extra motivation due to Mays' death that occurred just two days ago.\n\nThe Giants have been able to play well offensively in recent games, but they have struggled with their pitching. The team has allowed four or more runs in each of their last six games, making it difficult to consistently win.\n\nSan Francisco's starting pitcher at Rickwood Field tonight will be Keaton Winn, who currently possesses a 6.66 ERA and 3-7 record. That terrible start to the season must turn around this evening for the Giants to win the historic game.\n\nThe Cardinals enter this matchup with a 36-37 record, which is good enough to be second place in the National League Central. Since the team is still competing for first place in the division, winning this game is imperative for St. Louis tonight.\n\nThe Cardinals have been led by 22-year-old shortstop Masyn Winn, who boasts an incredible .293 batting average. The second-year player has been helped offensively by power hitter Nolan Gorman, who leads the team with 16 home runs and 34 RBI.\n\nFans can watch this MLB game at Rickwood Field for free online by using the free trials offered by DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birmingham_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Birmingham News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/BSXVSIOWYJFYVCCV322E6VNWZI.jpg?auth=4fcd580b1318f265e92f18f2c599b20529cd43f12537a5c384ed29231d634e44&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The ballpark, formerly the home of the Birmingham Black Barons, is considered the oldest professional ballpark in the U.S.\n\nThursday's game is the culmination of week-long events that began with a Monday screening and discussion of \"Say Hey, Willie Mays!\" an HBO documentary that chronicles the life and career of baseball legend Willie Mays. (The movie screening was planned before Mays' passing on June 18).\n\nOther events include local youth playing baseball at Regions Field, where the minor league Birmingham Barons play; a Wednesday luncheon honoring Negro Leagues families; and other community engagement events around the city.\n\nAlthough it was announced last year during the NABJ annual convention held in Birmingham, Thursday's game also will have added significance as it comes almost two months after MLB announced that Negro Leagues statistics will officially become part of its historical record, elevating them finally to major league status.\n\nMays, Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, and Henry Aaron all once played in the Negro Leagues before baseball's integration in 1947. Now their stats will be integrated and updated: Mays' hit total is now 3,293, up 10 from his 1948 season in Birmingham. Robinson's 49 hits with Kansas City raise his total to 1,567. Satchel Paige's win total is now 125 with his 28 Negro Leagues victories.\n\nNegro Leaguer and Baseball Hall of Famer Josh Gibson now is MLB's single-season record holder in batting average (.466 in 1943), slugging percentage (.974 in 1937), and OPS (1.474 in 1937). His career slugging percentage (.718) and OPS (1.177) now surpass Babe Ruth in both categories.\n\nMore than 2,300 players who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 through 1948 will be integrated into MLB's database. More statistics will continue to be revised and updated as more data and information is uncovered, say MLB officials.\n\n\"I think it's definitely way overdue and something that should have been done a long time ago,\" retired major leaguer Denard Span told the MSR. \"Those numbers and those players are being recognized and acknowledged. I think it's definitely a step in the right direction.\"\n\nSpan played 11 seasons in the majors -- the Twins drafted him in the first round (20 overall) in 2002 out of high school. He played five seasons in Minnesota (2008-12), then Washington (2013-15), San Francisco (2016-17), Tampa Bay and Seattle (2018). He retired from baseball in June 2020.\n\nAfter working for his hometown Tampa Bay Rays television broadcast team in 2023, Span joined the Twins television team this season as an analyst.\n\n\"It came about over the last couple of years\" when he filled in whenever absences occurred during Twins broadcasts, recalls Span. \"It was the right time where everything was able to align, and that's kind of how it materialized in a nutshell.\"\n\nOther than being scheduled to work a home series in late July, Span will mostly work Twins road games. \"I'm new to this,\" he admitted. [Former teammate and current Twins special assistant and television broadcaster] LaTroy Hawkins has been doing it a lot longer than me.\"\n\nAlthough he has yet to perfect his broadcast on-air style, \"I tried to keep it as simple as possible,\" said Span. He and Hawkins, along with MLB execs Tony Reagins and Tyrone Brooks, will be featured on a panel discussion at the July 31 Minnesota Twins' 13 annual Diversity Celebration at the team's ballpark.\n\nSpan also works with other former MLBers to attract more Blacks to baseball. \"I try to talk about the pros, about playing the game of baseball, and about all of the blessings that it brought to me and my families...and how beautiful of a game it is,\" he said proudly.\n\n\"I played basketball and football as well. I just try to encourage and encourage them and tell them honestly baseball has been good to me.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman-recorder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Minnesota

He was the kind of guy who was so strong that he could poke you in the arm and it would hurt, but he didn't know he was hurting you.\"\n\nThe indomitable Josh Gibson, nicknamed the Black Babe Ruth, managed all this while swinging a bat that measured 40 ounces and 41 inches - about 25% bigger than today's big leagues bats. \"You got to be a man,\" adds Kendrick, \"to swing that kind of lumber.\"\n\nOfficially, Gibson is now the man, after Major League Baseball announced the incorporation of records from the Negro Leagues, even though he never had an at-bat in the majors. The decision late last month to include more than 2,300 players followed a three-year research project, led by a special committee of Negro Leagues experts and statisticians.\n\nMLB's new stats database will formally launch before a special tribute game between the St Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants on Thursday at Alabama's Rickwood Field, home to the Birmingham Black Barons, the team that launched Willie Mays, perhaps the finest player to ever pick up a bat and glove. Until his death on Tuesday at age 93, Mays - AKA the \"Say Hey Kid\" - was one of three surviving Negro Leagues players and baseball's oldest living Hall of Famer. MLB had already planned to pay special tribute Mays at a Negro Leagues commemorative game in absentia.\n\nMLB's statistical integration rights a wrong that had endured since Major League Baseball accepted Black players into its ranks in 1947, precipitating the Negro Leagues' slow death the next year. Why it took nearly 80 years to integrate the stats is a matter of ongoing controversy, with critics accusing MLB of going woke, and some Black baseball fans feeling it all comes far too late in the day. Nevertheless, 77 years since he last swung his bat, Gibson, an imposing catcher and slugger once relegated to the shadows, now stands above the rest.\n\nA gentle giant who loomed large behind the plate, whether crouched in front of the umpire or rolling up his sleeves to show off his massive biceps, Gibson overtook Ty Cobb in career batting average, surpassed Ruth in on-base plus slugging (a prominent advanced stat that measures a hitter's ability to reach base and hit for average and power), and topped Barry Bonds's single-season slugging percentage record, in two different years.\n\nNo US sport is more serious about its stats than baseball. Learned fans call up the most hallowed marks - Hank Aaron's 755 home runs, Pete Rose's 4,256 hits, Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average (ERA), Mays's 660 homers, 339 steals and 7,769 putouts (from centerfield!) - as easily as their own phone numbers. Statistics for Negro Leagues players were just as painstakingly kept among teams and the Black press, which was no mean feat in a league where no set schedule was guaranteed to play out as planned.\n\n\"They had to scramble to keep afloat,\" says John Thorn, the MLB house historian who chaired the 17-person committee that decided baseball's stat integration. \"If they played two or three games in a day and one was a league game and two were against integrated semi-pros, well, it was a paycheck.\" Negro Leagues players barnstormed the country to make ends meet. They were forced into that hustle, adds Thorn, because of \"MLB's racism\".\n\nA 1969 committee on baseball records recognized six major leagues dating to 1876 - but excluded the Negro Leagues \"for no reason\", Thorn says. \"But while settling on those defunct rival leagues as equivalent of the major leagues, the subject of the Negro Leagues' caliber of play was not really much of a question. Everyone agreed it was pretty darn good. That's why I've taken to use the trope of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to describe the attitude toward Black baseball. It wasn't so much racist animus as it was the feeling that they weren't there.\"\n\nThe Negro Leagues weren't just an alternative pastime born from the two Americas that sprang up from segregation. As Sam Pollard shows in his 2023 documentary The League, the Negro Leagues teams were obvious indicators of thriving Black enclaves in major American cities. \"We couldn't go to major league games,\" Pollard told me, \"and if we did, we had to sit isolated, segregated from white audiences. So we created our own Black baseball teams, and that kept money circulating within our stores and funeral homes and the like, helping the community survive.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 2020, when Covid restrictions forced MLB to cut its schedule from 162 games to 60 (the baseline for an average Negro National League season) while making clear that the records generated during that span would be treated the same, that the league announced the integration of Negro League stats to correct \"a longtime oversight\". Over the course of six meetings, Thorn's MLB committee - which included representatives from the Negro Leagues database Seamheads, the MLB play-by-play archive Retrosheet and the Elias Sports Bureau, MLB's official record keeper - pored over decades' worth of game stories and box scores, separating out the inconsistencies among the stats (incongruent wins and losses) and stars (distinguishing among multiple players with the same name).\n\n\"In the end, once we acknowledged that a 60- to 80-game schedule may have been most frequent for Negro Leagues teams, we were able to empty a sliding, variable scale so that although the number of league-scheduled games per league, per team, per annum varied from year to year, what was constant is 3.1 plate appearances per scheduled game (to qualify for batting stats) and one inning pitched per scheduled game to qualify for ERA. Now the very same standards we used for white players we use for Black ones.\"\n\nThorn says the current analysis isn't the final word: \"There will be a version 2.0, and it will be richer than what we have today.\" Still, as overdue as these gestures are, there remains a contingency of Black baseball fans who feel as if this is too little, too late. Baseball stats have already been devalued after a number of players, including some Black players such as Bonds and Sammy Sosa, had their record-setting accomplishments invalidated during baseball's steroid era.\n\nMLB's nod to the Negro Leagues comes as Black American representation in the major leagues is at a historically low ebb. A USA Today study found that 5.7% of players were Black, the lowest percentage since 1955, and that five teams didn't have any Black players. David Justice, a former all-star and World Series champion with the Atlanta Braves, chalks a lot of that up to the high cost of entry.\n\n\"There's this thing called [youth] travel ball,\" Justice explained to Fox Sports' Keyshawn Johnson, a former NFL star who started out playing baseball, \"and it costs a lot of money. A [proper] baseball bat costs $400. And if you don't have the family, you don't have the money. But I can go out here and grab that basketball, and we can go hoop all day.\" Nevertheless, diversity has increased across the league, with Latino representation shooting up from a handful of players in 1948 to nearly 30% of players by opening day 2024.\n\nThe hope is that by finally integrating Gibson and other Negro Leaguers like Buck O'Neil (a Negro Leagues all-star first baseman turned MLB scout and coach) and Norman \"Turkey\" Stearnes (so nicknamed for his waddly flair for rounding the bases) into the official record, fans will connect with this hidden history and fall deeper in love with the game.\n\nSadly, Gibson, the second Black player inducted into baseball's hall of fame, died of a brain tumor-induced stroke at age 35, months before Jackie Robinson broke MLB's color line in 1947. When longtime followers of Black baseball say there were far more talented players in the Negro Leagues than Robinson who could've made that same history, Gibson's name usually comes up first. (Thorn says Branch Rickey, the visionary Dodgers general manager who brought Robinson in, \"wanted someone with a college education\", believing Robinson's years at the University of California at Los Angeles had better prepared him for white society.)\n\nYet in the mind of many baseball fans, Robinson and Gibson don't compare because Gibson, despite stronger numbers, never crossed over to MLB. To Kendrick, that's a bad-faith premise. \"Someone on social media hit me and said: 'Well, we just want to compare apples to apples,'\" says Kendrick. \"No major leaguer ever had to go through what these players in the Negro Leagues had to endure. Never had to worry about where they were going to get a meal, go to sleep. Never had to eat peanut butter and crackers on the bus, or get dressed underneath the stands because they couldn't use the facility in the ballpark, couldn't wash their uniforms. So it can never be apples to apples.\"\n\nFor Cindy Cobb, Ty's granddaughter, the record is straight. \"I envision Turkey and Ty playing together in the outfield,\" Cobb told ESPN. \"Let's never use the color of skin to separate people.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_lawrence@theguardian.com", "name": "Andrew

But there was no birthday celebration.\n\nIt had been five years since the Birmingham Barons of the Southern League had moved out, preferring the modern amenities of a brand-new ballpark in the southern suburb of Hoover. With no tenant, local residents who'd grown up attending games - both of the Barons in the white minor leagues and the Black Barons in the Negro leagues - had a legitimate fear that Rickwood would be demolished.\n\n\"Birmingham had a great old building that was our terminal station for rail and bus travelers. It was a beautiful piece of art, but it was torn down in 1976,\" recalls Gerald Watkins, the chairman of the board of the Friends of Rickwood, the non-profit tasked with preserving the ballpark. \"Some of us were old enough to remember the terminal going away, and we thought we didn't want to see this old ballpark go away the same way.\"\n\nThe facility had fallen into disrepair by 1992. When an advance crew from Hollywood came on a rainy night to check out the site for possible use in a movie, there was nowhere for them to meet in the grandstands. That's because water was pouring through the leaky roof everywhere they tried to gather.\n\nWith the aging park falling apart, Watkins feels this was the darkest point in Rickwood's history.\n\nBut the filmmakers decided the vintage look of the park was perfect for their bio-pic of Ty Cobb. After all, Cobb was playing for the Detroit Tigers when Rickwood was built in 1910.\n\n\"The city mobilized. Big companies in town mobilized. The Friends of Rickwood were formed, and enough money was raised to get the ballpark brought to a level where the film could be done,\" says Watkins. The film \"Cobb,\" starring Tommy Lee Jones in the title role, opened in 1994.\n\n\"That movie was the first inning of the rebirth of Rickwood,\" Watkins says.\n\nHe admits that since the work done for \"Cobb,\" \"It's been very hard to get any big money to do the repairs that were needed.\" Now the impending arrival of Major League Baseball for a game is giving this historic park another lease on life.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants will facethe St. Louis Cardinals in a regular-season game at Rickwood on June 20. Fox will handle the nationwide broadcast (7:15 ET) of the sold-out contest.\n\nMaintaining the magic\n\nBefore MLB decided to bring a game to Rickwood, it sent their advance team in the winter of 2022 to see if it would be feasible. After all, the structure and playing field had been around for 112 years.\n\nMurray Cook of Brightview has been MLB's main field consultant since 1993, when he prepared ballfields in Eastern Europe for a series of games by U.S. minor leaguers. The visit to Rickwood a year-and-a-half ago marked the first time he'd seen the wooden ballpark.\n\n\"It brought back memories of some of the old stadiums I'd worked in over the years,\" he recalls. \"It is a really unique, cool place.\"\n\nDespite that aura, the playing surface \"was basically a rec-level field. It was in really poor condition. It was some weeds, some grass, some Bermuda (grass), some more weeds. And the dugouts were like bunkers. When you were standing in one, you couldn't see the left fielder because there was a big bump in the middle of the field.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest anomalies were the foul lines.\n\n\"They'd been putting chalk down the foul lines for, what, 100 years,\" Cook says. \"This made the line literally a foot higher than the field on either side of it. We knew we were facing a challenge of building a new field that meets major league quality in an existing venue that wasn't designed to hold a regulation field.\"\n\nSo the first order of business was to excavate and remove the top two feet of the playing surface.\n\nA system of pipes was installed that could drain away rainwater at a rate of seven to 10 inches an hour. Above it, a layer of gravel was applied, then a blend of sand and dirt for the roots of the grass to grow into.\n\nThen bermuda-grass sod was meticulously rolled on top.\n\nCook's crew was also in charge of replacing the dugouts, the backstop, foul poles and the fencing around the field.\n\nBrightview also encountered two clashes of yesterday and today: The field needed netting all the way down the foul territory, very much unlike the screens of decades ago; and the existing light standards actually protruded from the top of the roof over the field.\n\n\"Those lights are part of the charm and history there, and we didn't want to take them down,\" Cooks says. \"We left the fixtures and took out the lenses and bulbs, so if a ball did hit them, you wouldn't have glass crashing onto a player.\"\n\nThe lighting for the MLB night game will come from temporary light standards, brought in on flatbed trucks.\n\n\"The big challenge with Rickwood was to ensure we maintained the magic and history of the venue,\" says Cook.\n\nCreating the pallet\n\nIn recent years, MLB has staged events in venues where none had existed previously. Examples include the pop-up ballpark built on an abandoned golf course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 2016 and the incredibly successful Field of Dreams games in the cornfield in Dyersville, Iowa, the past two years.\n\nRickwood Field presents unique challenges.\n\n\"We were handed a stadium that is very old and doesn't meet code in many ways,\" says Todd Barnes, principal at architecture firm Populous. \"We had to fit Major League Baseball into a place that was never intended to have it.\"\n\nThe park's tiny locker rooms and press box didn't come close to doing the job.\n\n\"Rickwood was never built in scale for any occupancy of this size,\" says Populous associate principal Michael Kinard. \"We have to provide almost all the facilities that are required for the event, from clubhouses to the operational area to media functions.\"\n\nWhat little parking had been adjacent to Rickwood is now occupied by a complex of temporary structures housing all of the functions needed to host a modern-day MLB contest. Fans will have to park at Legion Field a mile away and take shuttles to the ballpark.\n\n\"The goal was to take a very gentle touch to it,\" says Barnes. \"Obviously, we didn't want to overhaul a historic building.\"\n\nNo new structures were added. Instead, existing seats were removed to accommodate wheelchairs.\n\n\"We love these kinds of challenges and accept them with open arms. These are the best games for us overall,\" says Barnes. \"We're creating the pallet for MLB to frame the right game presentation to make it just an incredible day.\"\n\nJoe Mock covers sports

Opened in 1910, it has been the home to a variety of teams, most notably from the Negro Leagues. MLB legends like Dizzy Dean and others have graced its field, while Hall of Famers like the late Satchel Paige and Willie Mays played for the Birmingham Black Barons prior to becoming major-league greats.\n\nThe ballpark has been renovated to accompany the big-league scene, featuring two of the oldest teams in the league's history. The Cardinals are quietly pushing themselves back into playoff contention. With wins in six of their last 10 games, and an even 9-9 record in the month of June, they are up to second place in the National League Central, 7.5 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for first place. However, the Redbirds hold onto the last Wild Card spot, a half-game ahead of the pack.\n\nThe Giants are one of those teams trying to chase down St. Louis. Despite having lost back-to-back games, San Francisco is just one game back of a Wild Card spot. They are fourth in the NL West, 9.5 behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThursday night marks the first of six games between the Cards and Giants.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizzy_Dean", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dizzy Dean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satchel_Paige", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satchel Paige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/RAUXU2R4HVFHPF2E4WVLTO6TXE.jpg?auth=9bcd9e8634c831bddbf6523a622a8d1170279421e8c05862c9e300631951ca46&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

When the Cardinals and Giants play the first official regular-season game at Birmingham's Rickwood Field this week, it will honor the mythical reality of Negro Leagues legends and the ballpark dozens of them once roamed.\n\nBuilt in 1910, Rickwood Field is the oldest existing professional baseball stadium in the United States. It was a central setting for Negro Leagues games until the 1960s; the first minor league baseball stadium in the country with permanent lights for nighttime baseball; and a venue that hosted games featuring legends from Babe Ruth and Ted Williams to Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson.\n\n\"There is just so much history here,\" said Gerald Watkins, one of Rickwood Field's primary caretakers and a member of the Friends of Rickwood group, which helps operate the venue. \"It's a national treasure, and I'm glad we were able to get MLB to come here so the nation can know what we here locally have known for a long time.\"\n\nIt's largely thanks to Watkins that the Cardinals and Giants are coming to Rickwood. He had just retired from a career in banking in 2021 and volunteered to begin taking care of the old stadium full time when he saw MLB play at the Field of Dreams site. That was cool, Watkins thought, but based on a fictional movie. Wouldn't MLB want to play at a stadium with real history?\n\nHe reached out to MLB, which responded positively and promised to get back to him. The league did the next year, providing a list of all the work that would need to be done to the stadium -- the dugouts, for example, were built for the comparative Lilliputian ballplayers of the 1930s, not today's MLBehemoths, and the infield had a foot-and-a-half crown -- to make it suitable for a real MLB game.\n\n\"We were like the perfect storm for them,\" Watkins said. \"They saw a great opportunity here.\"\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\n\nTo determine just how much work it would take to bring that opportunity to life, BaAM Productions, MLB's right-hand firm for the one-off games that have become so popular during the last decade, in 2021 assessed the feasibility of hosting a game at Rickwood Field. Any such assessment must balance a site's potential for hosting high-level pro sports with the imaginative potential, said Shani Hamilton Greenlaw, who has overseen the project for BaAM.\n\nThe site -- the playing field especially -- had to be brought up to 2024 MLB levels. While BaAM would handle the historic look and feel of the event, Birmingham-based contractor A.G. Gaston handled design and renovation of the field, with BrightView's help.\n\n\"We knew we had some work to do,\" said Murray Cook, a 35-year MLB field and stadium consultant with commercial landscaping firm BrightView. \"The field was in pretty rough shape, the stadium needed some love, and the overall distances were a little skewed.\"\n\nThe city of Birmingham committed $4.5 million to the renovation, which began in October 2023. The foremost issue was the field's foot-and-a-half crown; a player standing in the original first-base dugout looking toward left field would only see the top half of the left fielder. The crowned surface was scraped off, with 4,000 tons of material removed to bring the playing field to grade. New drainage and sand were installed beneath a new grass surface.\n\nRickwood's unusually deep backstop area -- measuring 85 feet from home plate to the fence -- was a quirk appreciated by Bo Jackson, who played high school, college and minor league ball at the stadium and could routinely score from first on a catcher's passed ball. The backstop area was shortened to 60 feet, \"a change that I know a lot of people welcome,\" said Watkins.\n\nThe dugouts, so low that in recent years many players would sit on top of them during games, were replaced and the foul lines were dug up and relined; there was at least a foot-deep line of chalk, used for more than a hundred years to mark the foul lines for each game. New foul poles were also installed, a project that included replacing the right-field foul pole, which passed through the roof of the seating stand in that corner of the stadium.\n\nThe venue's funky dimensions -- roughly 478 feet to the concrete center-field wall; the deepest in MLB is Coors Field, at 415 -- were reshaped, resulting in 400 feet to center field, 370 to right field and 325 to left. The double-decker wall was kept, but padding added to its lower half.\n\nTemporary lighting from Musco Lighting will be used instead of the stadium's unique lighting structures. A media center, MLB-level clubhouses and locker rooms, and batting tunnels have been built adjacent to the old stadium. The stadium's seating stands, and iconic, nearly 100-year-old scoreboard remained largely untouched, though Fox broadcast positions have been scattered throughout. Engineering checks were conducted to ensure the ground could hold the weight of the new structures, and that the water, for example, was suitable for consumption.\n\nRickwood is more than just a nostalgic reminder of when baseball dominated the American sporting landscape. The venue remains in constant use and will continue to be, with its renovated field, after MLB leaves. The stadium is home to baseball teams from three Birmingham high schools and local HBCU Miles College, and serves as a mecca for youth travel baseball circuits; it hosts various travel tournaments on 18 of July's 31 days. The venue also has a steady private events business and has been used by the film industry as a historic baseball setting for movies like \"42,\" the 2013 film about Jackie Robinson integrating the major leagues. The interest in those will only increase following the MLB game.\n\nA big factor in how many private events and baseball tournaments are held at the stadium in the coming years will be how well the upgrades are maintained. MLB made it clear to Watkins and the Friends of Rickwood that if they wanted the league to come back and play another game at the stadium, they needed to take care of the changes. And, said Watkins, \"we desperately want MLB to come back a second time.\"\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\n\nFor this first game, the goal is \"vintage Rickwood will be the experience for everybody,\" according to BaAM President Annemarie Roe. With that in mind, the project team zeroed in on a look dating to the 1940s and '50s. BaAM, with the help of Populous, helped design and build the temporary plaza sitting between the ticketed entrance and the stadium's main entrance that will house MLB sponsor booths, interactive fan activities, Negro Leagues history graphic displays, an entertainment stage and an official MLB at Rickwood merchandise store. The historic clubhouses will be renovated and open for fans to tour.\n\nMLB Senior Creative Director Jason Yeadon was largely responsible for the details that create the aesthetic and design environment of the 1940s and '50s, arguably Rickwood Field's heyday. That work included creating a style guide that was referenced in all signage, wayfinding and sponsorship/advertising decisions, starting with the game's logo.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure we were pulling from an identity that felt like it was pulling from the Negro Leagues but that had a modern expression,\" he said, \"because this is a modern game.\"\n\nThe devotion to historical accuracy bled into sponsorship activations and signage. Major focus was devoted to making sure the sponsors' brands (colors, typography and voice) were authentic to the period and the event, especially if the brand existed between 1910 and 1950 (Budweiser, for example). Presentations were built out for roughly 15 sponsors to show how MLB would preserve the look of the outfield wall and how sponsors could turn their brand, logo and taglines vintage. Musco Lighting, for example, will have a retro, aged-looking sign on the outfield wall alluding to its part in baseball being played under the lights. Even the screws appending signage to buildings (and the outfield wall) are ones that could be found in the 1940s.\n\n\"From big to small,\" Yeadon said, \"all the details are going to make this feel like it's a game from that time.\"\n\nAll those small touches are likely to have a big effect at bringing to life the people and the moments that mark Rickwood's unique connection to the national pastime.\n\n\"The history is so palpable there,\" said Hamilton Greenlaw. \"I grew up as a baseball fan, my dad telling me about the Negro Leagues players and learning about Willie Mays and Satchel Paige, so knowing that they played there, it was amazing to be able to walk through that space and know that it had seen so many of baseball's most incredible players and has this history, just ...

Revisiting NBA legend's minor-league career with Birmingham Barons", "body": "There have been some all-time famous players that have, at some point, played baseball in Birmingham.\n\nThe great Willie Mays began his professional baseball career with the Birmingham Black Barons. One of the greatest pitchers of all time, Satchel Paige, wore a Black Barons uniform as well. Rollie Fingers, Reggie Jackson, Frank Thomas, and several other future Hall of Famers came through the city as minor leaguers.\n\nOne such baseball player -- arguably more famous than all of them combined -- went on to play exactly zero games in the major leagues: Michael Jordan.\n\nConsidered by many the greatest basketball player of all time and perhaps the greatest athlete of all time, Jordan briefly left basketball to play baseball in 1994, signing with the Chicago White Sox and joining the organization's minor leagues.\n\nWhere was he assigned? That would be Birmingham, where he joined the franchise's Double-A affiliate.\n\nAs Major League Baseball prepares to head to Birmingham to play in Rickwood Field, the longtime home of the Negro League Birmingham Black Barons and at several points the home of the Barons, Sporting News is taking a look back at Jordan's baseball career in Birmingham.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Willie Mays' career, from Birmingham Black Barons to the Giants\n\nJordan missed playing at Rickwood Field by a few years.\n\nThe Barons played at Rickwood Field from 1910-87, with the only breaks coming during periods in which the team did not exist. The field was the home of the Black Barons from the first edition of the team in 1920 to the final disbanding of the organization in 1960, just over two years before Jordan was born.\n\nInstead, Jordan's lone season in the minors came in 1994, when the Double-A Barons played baseball at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium. The team moved to Regions Field in 2013.\n\nMORE: Was Michael Jordan good at baseball?\n\nJordan announced he would be retiring from basketball on Oct. 6, 1993. He later said the murder of his father during a carjacking was a contributing factor to the decision.\n\nHis father, James Jordan, was a baseball fan, and Michael played the sport when he was young. He wound up deciding he would give baseball a chance.\n\nJerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Bulls, also owned the White Sox, which made the franchise a natural fit for Jordan. He had already taken batting practice at Comiskey Park and had previously mentioned interest in trying baseball.\n\nThe White Sox signed Jordan to a minor-league deal on Feb. 7, 1994, just before he turned 31. Jordan did not get off to a hot start in spring training, but late in the spring, he went 2-for-5 with a double in the Windy City Classic exhibition game at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"I don't think I've proven I can make the team,\" Jordan told writers that spring, as reported in TSN's Chicago White Sox team notes. \"That's just being honest. ... But I'm not going to give up. I'm trying to squeeze five years into eight weeks. It just hasn't happened the way I wanted it to.\"\n\nMORE: Photos from Michael Jordan's baseball career\n\nJordan did not make the big-league roster and was assigned to Double-A Birmingham. He debuted with Birmingham on April 8, 1994.\n\nThe NBA legend had a respectable campaign for the Barons, particularly for someone who hadn't played professional baseball before the season. He hit .202 with a .556 OPS and three home runs. He also swiped 30 bases, walked 41 times, and struck out 114 times in 127 games (497 plate appearances).\n\nJordan later went on to play in the Arizona Fall League after the season, hitting .252.\n\nJordan's manager, Terry Francona, who later went on to manage the Red Sox to a pair of World Series wins and Cleveland to a pennant, said he felt Jordan could have reached the majors had he had more playing time.\n\n\"I do think with another 1,000 at-bats, he would've made it,\" Francona said, per ESPN. \"But there's something else that people miss about that season. Baseball wasn't the only thing he picked up. I truly believe that he rediscovered himself, his joy for competition. We made him want to play basketball again.\"\n\nJordan did not wind up playing again in baseball. He returned to basketball after the season in Birmingham, ending his lone year in professional baseball.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

But there was no birthday celebration.\n\nIt had been five years since the Birmingham Barons of the Southern League had moved out, preferring the modern amenities of a brand-new ballpark in the southern suburb of Hoover. With no tenant, local residents who'd grown up attending games - both of the Barons in the white minor leagues and the Black Barons in the Negro leagues - had a legitimate fear that Rickwood would be demolished.\n\n\"Birmingham had a great old building that was our terminal station for rail and bus travelers. It was a beautiful piece of art, but it was torn down in 1976,\" recalls Gerald Watkins, the chairman of the board of the Friends of Rickwood, the non-profit tasked with preserving the ballpark. \"Some of us were old enough to remember the terminal going away, and we thought we didn't want to see this old ballpark go away the same way.\"\n\nThe facility had fallen into disrepair by 1992. When an advance crew from Hollywood came on a rainy night to check out the site for possible use in a movie, there was nowhere for them to meet in the grandstands. That's because water was pouring through the leaky roof everywhere they tried to gather.\n\nWith the aging park falling apart, Watkins feels this was the darkest point in Rickwood's history.\n\nBut the filmmakers decided the vintage look of the park was perfect for their bio-pic of Ty Cobb. After all, Cobb was playing for the Detroit Tigers when Rickwood was built in 1910.\n\n\"The city mobilized. Big companies in town mobilized. The Friends of Rickwood were formed, and enough money was raised to get the ballpark brought to a level where the film could be done,\" says Watkins. The film \"Cobb,\" starring Tommy Lee Jones in the title role, opened in 1994.\n\n\"That movie was the first inning of the rebirth of Rickwood,\" Watkins says.\n\nHe admits that since the work done for \"Cobb,\" \"It's been very hard to get any big money to do the repairs that were needed.\" Now the impending arrival of Major League Baseball for a game is giving this historic park another lease on life.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants will facethe St. Louis Cardinals in a regular-season game at Rickwood on June 20. Fox will handle the nationwide broadcast (7:15 ET) of the sold-out contest.\n\nBefore MLB decided to bring a game to Rickwood, it sent their advance team in the winter of 2022 to see if it would be feasible. After all, the structure and playing field had been around for 112 years.\n\nMurray Cook of Brightview has been MLB's main field consultant since 1993, when he prepared ballfields in Eastern Europe for a series of games by U.S. minor leaguers. The visit to Rickwood a year-and-a-half ago marked the first time he'd seen the wooden ballpark.\n\n\"It brought back memories of some of the old stadiums I'd worked in over the years,\" he recalls. \"It is a really unique, cool place.\"\n\nDespite that aura, the playing surface \"was basically a rec-level field. It was in really poor condition. It was some weeds, some grass, some Bermuda (grass), some more weeds. And the dugouts were like bunkers. When you were standing in one, you couldn't see the left fielder because there was a big bump in the middle of the field.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest anomalies were the foul lines.\n\n\"They'd been putting chalk down the foul lines for, what, 100 years,\" Cook says. \"This made the line literally a foot higher than the field on either side of it. We knew we were facing a challenge of building a new field that meets major league quality in an existing venue that wasn't designed to hold a regulation field.\"\n\nSo the first order of business was to excavate and remove the top two feet of the playing surface.\n\nA system of pipes was installed that could drain away rainwater at a rate of seven to 10 inches an hour. Above it, a layer of gravel was applied, then a blend of sand and dirt for the roots of the grass to grow into.\n\nThen bermuda-grass sod was meticulously rolled on top.\n\nCook's crew was also in charge of replacing the dugouts, the backstop, foul poles and the fencing around the field.\n\nBrightview also encountered two clashes of yesterday and today: The field needed netting all the way down the foul territory, very much unlike the screens of decades ago; and the existing light standards actually protruded from the top of the roof over the field.\n\n\"Those lights are part of the charm and history there, and we didn't want to take them down,\" Cooks says. \"We left the fixtures and took out the lenses and bulbs, so if a ball did hit them, you wouldn't have glass crashing onto a player.\"\n\nThe lighting for the MLB night game will come from temporary light standards, brought in on flatbed trucks.\n\n\"The big challenge with Rickwood was to ensure we maintained the magic and history of the venue,\" says Cook.\n\nIn recent years, MLB has staged events in venues where none had existed previously. Examples include the pop-up ballpark built on an abandoned golf course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 2016 and the incredibly successful Field of Dreams games in the cornfield in Dyersville, Iowa, the past two years.\n\nRickwood Field presents unique challenges.\n\n\"We were handed a stadium that is very old and doesn't meet code in many ways,\" says Todd Barnes, principal at architecture firm Populous. \"We had to fit Major League Baseball into a place that was never intended to have it.\"\n\nThe park's tiny locker rooms and press box didn't come close to doing the job.\n\n\"Rickwood was never built in scale for any occupancy of this size,\" says Populous associate principal Michael Kinard. \"We have to provide almost all the facilities that are required for the event, from clubhouses to the operational area to media functions.\"\n\nWhat little parking had been adjacent to Rickwood is now occupied by a complex of temporary structures housing all of the functions needed to host a modern-day MLB contest. Fans will have to park at Legion Field a mile away and take shuttles to the ballpark.\n\n\"The goal was to take a very gentle touch to it,\" says Barnes. \"Obviously, we didn't want to overhaul a historic building.\"\n\nNo new structures were added. Instead, existing seats were removed to accommodate wheelchairs.\n\n\"We love these kinds of challenges and accept them with open arms. These are the best games for us overall,\" says Barnes. \"We're creating the pallet for MLB to frame the right game presentation to make it just an incredible day.\"\n\nJoe Mock covers sports

MLB at Rickwood Field to Honor Willie Mays:\n\nThe Giants and Cardinals are set to face off this evening in a game at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama scheduled for 6:15pm local time. The game, which will be televised nationally on FOX, was initially scheduled as a tribute to the Negro Leagues and their storied history but has taken on additional meaning after the recent passing of MLB legend Willie Mays earlier this week. Mays briefly played a professional in the Negro Leagues during the 1948 season as a member of the Birmingham Black Barons, appearing in 13 games for the club as a 17-year-old in the midst of a season where the Black Barons went on to capture the NAL pennant before losing the final Negro League World Series to the Homestead Grays in five games.\n\nThe Black Barons (and, by extension, Mays) called Rickwood Field their home ballpark. First established in 1910, it's the oldest professional ballpark in the US and two years older than Fenway Park in Boston. More than 75 years after the last Negro League game was played there, Major League play returns to Rickwood Field tonight as St. Louis and San Francisco face off with right-handed youngsters Andre Pallante and Keaton Winn on the mound. Tonight's game will (as relayed by The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal) feature the first entirely black crew of umpires in AL/NL history and figures to celebrate not only the storied history of the Negro Leagues, but also the life and career of Mays.\n\n2. Abrams to undergo MRI:\n\nNationals shortstop CJ Abrams was scratched from yesterday's lineup against the Diamondbacks due to what manager Davey Martinez told reporters (including those at MLB.com) was being termed discomfort in his left wrist. Martinez went on to add that Abrams wasn't sure what was causing the discomfort, and that the club planned to send their young star for an MRI to ensure all was well. The 23-year-old Abrams has enjoyed a breakout season with the Nationals this year as he's slashed an impressive .261/.313/.478 with 10 stolen bases and 11 home runs in 66 games this year. That strong slash line comes in spite of a difficult month of May where Abrams hit just .205/.216/.304 in 27 games.\n\nAbrams's breakout campaign has helped the Nationals to be surprisingly competitive this season, as the club is currently tied with the Cardinals for the second of three NL Wild Card spots despite a lackluster 36-37 record. A significant stretch of time without Abrams would be a brutal blow to the Nationals' odds of holding onto that position, as his 1.2 fWAR leads the club's positional corps. Nasim Nunez took over for Abrams at shortstop yesterday and could be the club's top option to fill in if Abrams requires a trip to the injured list.\n\n3. Toro battling shoulder soreness:\n\nA's infielder Abraham Toro is dealing with a bout of shoulder soreness, as noted by MLB.com's Martin Gallegos yesterday. The issue first cropped up during Oakland's doubleheader against the Twins on Sunday and has caused him to miss each of the past two games. As relayed by Gallegos, Toro was scheduled to meet with team doctors to discuss how to handle the injury but manager Mark Kotsay told reporters after the game that he had no update on Toro's status and that more information about the infielder would be available today.\n\nToro, 27, has had a decent season with the A's this year. He's posted a roughly average slash line of .256/.298/381 in 71 games for the club this year while splitting time between first base, second base, third base, and left field throughout the year. In the aftermath of the club's decision to designate J.D. Davis for assignment earlier this week, it appeared likely that Toro would be handed the keys to third base full time, although with Toro now possibly injured, Oakland will have to find a new solution at the hot corner. Infielder Tyler Nevin has handled third base duties so far during Toro's absence and could be the club's long-term answer there if Toro misses further time, although rookie third baseman Brett Harris is also on the 40-man roster after getting a 17-game cup of coffee in the majors earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"},

I mean, at least we hear now at the top, we can talk about it,\" Cobbin said.\n\nCoverage of the Major League tribute to the Negro Leagues begins at 5:30 p.m.. on FOX Youngstown.\n\nThe Cardinals and Giants will wear special uniforms during their game from Birmingham, which starts at 7:15 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_sess@wkbn.com", "name": "Dave Sess", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Youngstown, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Youngstown, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Clowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Clowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Black_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Black Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "wgt": 25}], "image": "https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/06/jim-cobbin-negro-leagues-mlb.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Youngstown, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

That announcement, made in late May, vaulted legendary player Josh Gibson's .372 career batting average ahead of the title's long-time owner, Ty Cobb. Gibson's .466 average in 1943 is now the single-season record.\n\nThe inclusion of the stats is the outgrowth of MLB recognizing in 2020 the Negro Leagues as Major Leagues, like the AL or NL. And it came just weeks after the National Baseball Hall of Fame opened its exhibit, \"The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball,\" and celebrated it by hosting the East-West Classic, an exhibition tribute to the Negro Leagues All-Star Game that featured retired MLB players like Ozzie Smith and Ryan Howard.\n\nGerald Early, the Merle Kling Professor of Modern Letters in Arts & Sciences at Washington University, is a lifelong baseball fan and author who was a curatorial consultant on the exhibit in Cooperstown, New York. He was asked what it means to have all of these events, though not officially connected, come together.\n\n\"If you want to have a larger theme -- it's all about reconciliation,\" Early said. \"This country's past has been marred by segregation and racism, and to have these things happening as they are I think is a great thing as far as coming to grips with our history. It is a very good thing that Major League Baseball is creating this recognition -- this well-earned recognition. ... All of these things coming together are a way for us as Americans to learn our history, to learn to live with this history, and by learning make us better.\"\n\nEarly's forthcoming book, \"Play Harder: The Triumph of Black Baseball in America,\" will be published next spring in association with the Hall's exhibit. Early was approached by the Hall to help create the exhibit, one of the most technologically modern at the Hall.\n\nWork began in June 2022 for a group that included former players, Hall of Famers, historians and others, and it often took Early to Cooperstown. The exhibit includes artifacts like Cool Papa Bell's cleats. To tell the stories beyond the items, Early and others mined quotes from players, owners, fans, newspaper coverage and writers because he felt it was important to give voice to the history.\n\nThe Post-Dispatch spoke with Early recently about the exhibit, his book, the Rickwood game and more, with all these historic threads coming together to strengthen the connection between today's game and all the leagues that helped create it. The conversation is published here in chronological order, with the exception of the above quote, and it is edited only for length and clarity.\n\nQuestion: When you described going beyond the stats and artifacts to sharing a \"view of baseball\" and its cultural significance in the exhibit, could you expound on that goal?\n\nAnswer: Baseball is a game that has meaning for people who are hardcore fans of the performance, of the players, of the performance of the teams. But baseball has a wider significance to the culture, a wider significance to our country beyond the fans. It means something to people who are not even fans. That is what I mean by a larger kind of story, or a larger kind of view.\n\nWhat does this game mean to the country itself?\n\nWhat does it mean to people who have no engagement with this game, and how has this game affected the country? Because this game has affected the country beyond the people who follow it.\n\nI wanted to make sure that story got in there. Particularly for the Black people playing baseball because Black people played baseball for a long time under a certain kind of duress, you might say, a set of disadvantages. And that means something that the game was that important to a minority group of people to want to be engaged in this game and to play this game with the persistence that they do.\n\nQ: And that is true for so many, from players, fans, to owners ...\n\nA: Yes, it goes beyond the players. It goes to the owners who wanted this to happen. It goes to the Black press that was supporting it and promoting it. It goes to other Black businesses in the Black community that were also promoting it and supporting it and trying to create a fan base for the game. The fact that they were able to work these elements to bring (the Negro Leagues) about is a very impressive story. I think it's a story that all Americans -- it shouldn't matter what race you are -- all Americans should be proud of that.\n\nThat this game meant that much to these people to put that amount of effort in.\n\nQ: How does the exhibit share that?\n\nA: The exhibit does it by zeroing in on certain personalities connected to the game so that you get a sense of the people who were important to the game. Of course, Jackie Robinson, obviously, but also people like Effa Manley (Newark Eagles' owner and Hall of Famer), and earlier people like Rube Foster (Hall of Famer nicknamed the 'Father of Black baseball'), Bud Fowler (groundbreaking player in 19th century and Hall of Famer). The commitment by these people to want to play and want to organize -- that's the key word. They wanted to organize something.\n\nQ: The title of your upcoming book, 'Play Harder,' comes from a description Leon Wagner (a Cardinals outfielder in 1960) gave for how he reacted in the minors to racism and threats. Why choose that phrase?\n\nA: That expression, 'play harder,' was something in my research I discovered many Black players said this. They felt they had a certain kind of challenge, of having to prove themselves to play this game. Which is why the saying of 'play harder' became almost a motto among people. The inspiring thing about this is people didn't let the adversities stop them. They just said, 'OK, fine. I'm going to go harder to overcome.' I think it's a story that is actually inspiring in that way.\n\nQ: When you discuss how baseball's history is far-reaching beyond players and fans of the game, you have used the word 'citizenship' -- if you're a part of the national pastime, it's a way to be a part of the nation. Am I saying that right?\n\nA: I think that's pretty much the point. Black people wanted to play the game because they liked the game and felt here is a way for us to show we're Americans, to show we are a part of the nation, that we're playing this game, and that we're good at playing this game. There was a pride in that to show a mastery of the game. This is the American game, and we're going to show that we can play as well as anyone else. It had a lot to do with citizenship. It had a lot to do with belonging to the nation.\n\nQ: In that way, what does it mean for the Negro Leagues to be, officially, a Major League?\n\nA: One of the reasons why the Negro Leagues started -- Rube Foster got it off the ground -- was they saw it as a proving ground. He said, 'Oh, I'm preparing people who will ultimately play in the major leagues.' The goal was always to get Black players to play in the major leagues.\n\nSo, I think this latest recognition of the Negro Leagues is long overdue, and the Negro Leagues deserve this recognition because they operated under a lot of disadvantages. And they persevered. I believe this recognition of them as a Major League is something that those men and women who were involved in that league -- they're owed that.\n\nIt should make everybody in the country happier to know Black baseball is getting its recognition and Black baseball produced such an excellent product.\n\nQ: The exhibit is a walk through history, Josh Gibson's statistics are historic, but the game at Rickwood is something present -- it will impact this year's standings. How powerful could this event be by highlighting history but then making history on that field with a modern game?\n\nA: That's a good point. It's very important that Major League Baseball is not just having a historic game or a re-creation game. They're having an actual, live game that counts in the standings. It's an important way for Major League Baseball to pay homage to the Negro Leagues as well as to show that, by having the game there, there is a continuity between what happened before and what we have now.\n\nThere is continuity. There is connection.\n\nAnd we're part of a tradition.\n\nWhat happened with the Negro Leagues is part of our traditions with baseball right now. That is important for people to understand, and it makes Major League Baseball that much richer understanding that Negro League baseball is part of its tradition. To have a real game, that's the importance. It makes it a kind of living history. We're not just trying to replicate the past. We're also trying to show this history is part of what we do today.\n\nQ: How did this research, this work, change your relationship with baseball?\n\nA: Well, I was a fan. I always enjoyed baseball. I like baseball a lot. The whole thing with this book and the whole thing of being involved with the exhibit for me was a way of giving back, of showing my appreciation by doing this work and also a way for me to kind of contribute something. It's a small contribution, but I hope that it might have some meaning for people. As I said to people: I have a connection with the Hall of Fame. When I was a kid, I thought I might make the Hall of Fame. I was 8 or 9 and, 'Oh, I'll make the Hall of Fame by being a great baseball player.' Of course, I turned out to not be a great baseball player.\n\nBut to find this connection for the Black players and the ex-players and (have them) show so much appreciation for the exhibit, that is extremely gratifying.\n\nIt's made me feel an even deeper connection to baseball, to feel even more than that -- that baseball is something that's important to our culture. It's done that for me.\n\nQ: I wondered if it's possible researching and telling these stories about baseball, and its flaws, strengthened your fondness, your fandom.\n\nA: Yeah, I think so. I've always gone to games. I was a Cardinals season ticket holder for a while. I've really always enjoyed the game very much. All this research, all this work, all these books by people gave me a deeper appreciation of it.\n\nI'm certainly a more informed fan.\n\nI really think I'm a better fan now.\n\nTipsheet: Tributes

At its gates, on the West Bank of the Nile River, stood two gigantic statues of the pharaoh. Carved from a slab of quartzite stone, the pair of 60-foot monuments are known as the Colossi of Memnon.\n\nEarthquakes, floods, pillaging and centuries of decay have withered the 85-acre memorial complex to mere rubble. But the Colossi of Memnon remain. Towering and majestic.\n\nMeeting Willie Mays, the experience of seeing him, was like standing at the feet of a colossal figure. He was sitting, his San Francisco Giants cap pulled down. His dark-rimmed eyes ever gentle. His smile warm. His massive hands draped in skin wrinkled like worn leather. He was no longer as sculpted and vibrant as his glory days. Yet, somehow, he was no less statuesque.\n\nHis aura was still 60 feet. His presence still kingly.\n\nI couldn't call my dad, who'd passed away by the time of my encounter. So I called his oldest brother, who I knew would comprehend my awe. He repeated stories of being a kid when Mays visited his neighborhood and how my grandfather took them on special trips to see him play.\n\nThe magnitude of this man. Who lures the giddy out of grizzled veterans. Who widens the eyes of youngsters not yet born when he retired.\n\nIt's difficult to overstate the impact of Mays. Because it's difficult to overstate the importance of baseball to Black history and, thus, American history. Even more difficult to realize such eminence is largely a relic of history.\n\nCan I miss a version of a sport I've never known?\n\nThe participation numbers, especially in MLB, declare the dynasty of Black baseball as rubble, its value and depth only discoverable through excavation. Hence the significance of Thursday's game between the Giants and St. Louis Cardinals being played at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Ala. Black baseball is a history worth discovering, rediscovering and preserving. And we know where to look because the sport's giant statues aren't going anywhere.\n\nNone bigger than the \"Say Hey Kid,\" who reigned when Black inferiority was the popular propaganda. His dominance on the diamond was unmatched. His status in the culture is unparalleled. The player and the persona. The Colossi of Mays forever remains. At the entrance of an ancient greatness.\n\nThe death of Mays, on the eve of Juneteenth, with the attention of baseball turned to Rickwood Field, feels like a memorial for the relationship between African-Americans and baseball, which for a large swath of modern history was as much an American story as any.\n\nIt's taken generations for MLB to champion the legitimacy of Negro Leagues baseball. For decades the masses have been denied the treasures of Black baseball, buried like the expansive amazement of a pilfered Egypt. The inclusion of Negro League stats with MLB's is a step towards proper honor.\n\nThe original No. 24 dying in 2024 -- on 6/18, no less -- seems like a divine message for us to stop and commemorate.\n\nAppreciate what baseball meant to this country, and to Black people.\n\nAppreciate a man so good as to merge segments of a segregated society.\n\nAppreciate a time when a player's greatness could be a unifying force.\n\nNobody would trade current progress for the witness of past honor, especially not with my melanin. But, man, how grand was baseball then? A man dominating a sport with a stick could be so powerful as to crumble barriers. Now, the barrier is a desire to stick to sports.\n\nTimes change. Eras end. Legends transition. But clearly some generations, and their giants, are worth lamenting having missed.\n\nIt's the rite of the old to romanticize their day, fawn over feats from their more fervent years. But the era of the Negro Leagues and the pioneers who merged into Major League Baseball is every bit worth the enchantment. Modernity can't diminish their grandiosity.\n\nAnd no one, perhaps ever, provoked praise like Willie Mays. He moved men's souls.\n\nMays was a pinnacle of baseball, which made him a pinnacle of American elitism. Baseball was the sport of superiority, the perfect test of cerebral and physical. It boasted the hardest thing to do in sports along with the chess between a battery and a batter and its requisite of meticulousness. Blacks excelling in baseball was a referendum on the pervasive notion of Black inferiority by way of limited intelligence.\n\nMays did more than disprove such indoctrination with his success, endowing a generation with confidence. He melted the cold off many hearts and kept even more young ones from being frozen by bigotry. Black baseball created a Justice League of sports heroes to challenge the paradigm of America in the midst of Jim Crow. We can still feel the pride they provoked, still smell the aroma of unity they inspired.\n\nBaseball held a special place in the hearts of many African-Americans in the 1950s and '60s, and well into the '70s. It was more than a game. It was a symbol of progress and resilience in the face of adversity. Black players powered through rampant discrimination and even violence. In a nation that habitually beat down its Black citizens, these players helped inspire generations to pursue their dreams and challenge race-based ceilings.\n\nIn many cases, White players embraced them, and White fans cheered for them, as a fist of rebellion against their own culture. Because when baseball appraised the quality of a man, the pure of heart couldn't ignore it.\n\nBlack baseball players were so good they changed America. How special that must have been to witness, to experience.\n\nUnfortunately, you had to be there to truly grasp their majesty. Their collective greatness is largely lost, the context of their merit buried like jewels in Kemet sands, leaving us with mostly oral history from fading memories. And giant statue figures.\n\nMany of us can't remember Mays, and we certainly don't know a world where baseball was larger than life. Their prestige is only understood through bequeathal. We can't fathom the emotional stakes of games between Negro League and all-White MLB squads. How those players endured racism, discrimination and general venom directed at their skin color to prove their worth through baseball.\n\nWhile their athletic excellence was conceded, the intellectual capacity of Blacks was perennially doubted. In stepped Mays. He didn't use his platform and voice so much to speak for and about Black people, yet his preeminence exclaimed as much. He was quick with his feet, his hands and his wits. He boasted strength and strategy. Power and patience. Grit and grace. He was a complete player, with five-fifths of the tools, and his larger-than-life presence matched the flair of his game. He endured the worst of his society before it embraced him.\n\nIt's a version of baseball never to be seen again. A brand that produced so many seminal moments and titanic figures.\n\nPerhaps it's the price of progress, but the estrangement of Black athletes and baseball settles like a loss. Players no longer need to bat .300, or throw a no-hitter, or call a good game behind the plate, to prove their capacity. Not for the sane, anyway. And MLB, a prominent steward of the sport, has struggled to win Black players back to a beautiful game. So we must dig up the buried gems. That era is a mortuary reduced to rubble. Kept alive by baseball archeologists, preserving our connection to this precious history.\n\nFortunately, they'll always know where to look. Because at the gates of the epoch of Black baseball are the towering statues, colossal enough to withstand time. And Mays was chief among them.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marcus_thompson_ii@nytimes.com", "name": "Marcus Thompson Ii", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossi_of_Memnon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colossi of Memnon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharaoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickwood_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rickwood Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortuary_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortuary temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Dynasty_of_Egypt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African-American history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartzite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quartzite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amenhotep III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modern era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/20104149/GettyImages-515546934.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

( Pat Benic/UPI/Newscom)\n\nJosh Gibson died in January 1947, a little more than three months before Jackie Robinson broke professional baseball's so-called \"color barrier.\"\n\nDespite never playing a single inning in the two leagues that comprise Major League Baseball (MLB), Gibson is now officially recognized as the player with the best career batting average in MLB history: He hit .372 during his years in the Negro Leagues, a few points higher than Ty Cobb's career average of .367, the previously recognized top mark.\n\nIt's a somewhat incoherent idea to have Gibson on top of the batting average charts, but that's the awkward result of the MLB's decision earlier this year to officially elevate the Negro Leagues -- a collection of various circuits that existed in the first half of the 20th century, when nonwhite players were kept out of the National League and American League -- to \"major league\" status. As a result, Gibson and other stars of the Negro Leagues are now recognized alongside figures like Babe Ruth (who played before the major leagues were integrated) and Hank Aaron (who played after they were).\n\nIn announcing that decision, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said the goal was \"ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible.\"\n\nIt's a decision that should be understood as an attempt to apply some measure of justice to the sins of professional baseball's racist past, but it's also a decision that underlines the impossibility of fixing some injustices after the fact.\n\nIn short, Gibson might deserve to be recognized as the best hitter in baseball history. He was certainly tremendously talented. But what he really deserved was a chance to play against the best players of his generation, regardless of the color of their skin. Nothing can fix that now.\n\nI'm thinking about all this today because MLB is hosting a special game tonight at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, which was once the home field for the Birmingham Black Barons, one of the top Negro League teams. Tonight's game is meant to celebrate that complicated chapter of baseball's history -- and specifically to celebrate the late Willie Mays, who played in Birmingham before joining the San Francisco Giants.\n\nCelebrating that history is overdue and welcome. So are other celebrations more broadly focused on the end of institutional racism, which the MLB does every year on April 15, the anniversary of Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Think of it as baseball's version of Juneteenth.\n\nBut changing the record books feels a bit different to me. It awkwardly seems like the right thing to do while also muddying the actual history and obscuring the fact that the institution now elevating Gibson (and other pre-integration black stars) is the same institution that once kept them out.\n\nMaybe that's progress, and maybe it's also the best that we can do under the circumstances -- and without a time machine.\n\nStill, the dilemma posed by the updated MLB record book reflects the broader difficulty of reckoning with America's racially segregated past. Baseball's experience is a useful thought experiment since it strips away some factors that complicate debates over policies like reparations. No one is being actively harmed by the MLB's rewriting of the record books. No assets are being redistributed.\n\nSo why does it feel so unsatisfying?\n\nPart of the answer, I think, is because it seems obviously fake. We don't know what career batting average Gibson would have posted if he'd been allowed to play in an integrated major league. For that matter, we also don't know what batting average Cobb would have recorded or how many home runs Ruth would have hit if they'd faced the best pitchers in the game -- instead of only the best white pitchers.\n\nIn The Atlantic, Malcolm Ferguson suggests that the only fair way to square that history away would be the creation of separate record books for the MLB's pre- and post-integration years.\n\nThat's probably the right answer to the acute issue of baseball records, though of course the MLB as a private institution has the right to include or exclude whatever records it wants. For the record, a post-integration ranking of best hitters in MLB history would have Ted Williams (who was white) in the top spot, with Tony Gywnn (who was black) in second. That's a ranking that few baseball fans would disagree with, and one that reflects the widely held belief that they were the best hitters of their eras.\n\nUnfortunately, resolving other injustices around institutional racism are more difficult than rearranging names on a list. In a broader context, the complexity of baseball's new record book should serve a reminder about why it is so important to oppose injustice in the moment when it is happening -- because post hoc attempts at rectifying the past are always going to be incomplete and unfulfilling.\n\nRecognition of the Negro Leagues' statistics isn't truly delivering justice to players like Josh Gibson. We'll never know what kind of career he would have had if institutional racism hadn't robbed him of an opportunity that cannot be restored. It's not fair to fans of baseball either, who were permanently robbed of seeing what he could have accomplished against the best players of all races.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_boehm@reason.com", "name": "Eric Boehm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hank Aaron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ty Cobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackie Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babe Ruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Black_Barons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Black Barons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 37}], "image": "https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/06/upiphotos927300-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665999", "eventUri": "eng-9665999", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-15", "textStart": 2524, "textEnd": 2532}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It was the longtime home of the Birmingham Black Barons, a team with significant ties to Memphis.\n\nThey were known as \"the jewel of southern Black baseball.\" Their early days marked by young players like the legendary Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige. But the golden era for the Birmingham Black Barons really started with a Memphis mortician.\n\nThomas Hayes Jr., one of the \"sons\" of Memphis's T.H. Hayes & Sons Funeral Home, bought the team in 1939. Over the next decade, the Black Barons won three Negro American League pennants. The last coming in 1948 with a young star named Willie Mays. The original contract Mays and Hayes signed is housed in the T.H. Hayes Collection at the Benjamin Hooks Library in Memphis, along with other relics from the Black Barons.\n\nBut with Jackie Robinson breaking Major League Baseball's color barrier a year earlier, the demand for Black players shifted to MLB. Hayes sold Mays's contract to the New York Giants in 1950 for $10,000. The paperwork detailing the agreement is also part of the T.H. Hayes Collection at the library.\n\nBy 1952, the team was struggling financially, and Hayes sold the Black Barons. Birmingham won one more championship before disbanding in 1-60.\n\nThat was one year after the Bluff City's team in the Negro American League folded.\n\nThe Memphis Red Sox trace their lineage to 1-20 and A.P. Martin's Barber College Team, which played at Russwood Park on Madison Ave. The ballpark was home of the white Memphis Chicks minor league team. In 1922, the Barber Boys, adding members of the long-running Memphis Union Giants, became the Red Sox.\n\nThe team was later bought by R.S. Lewis, another Memphis mortician, perhaps best known for handling Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s body after his assassination. He built Lewis Park for the team at Iowa and Wellington streets, which are now E.H. Crump and Danny Thomas boulevards.\n\nA historical marker still stands at the site of what would later be named Martin Stadium renamed after the team was sold to Memphis doctors W.S. and J.B. Martin and several other men in 1927. It was one of only a few stadiums in the country specifically built for a Negro League team.\n\nThe Red Sox were charter members of the Negro American League in 1937 winning the league's championship a year later.\n\nFour Red Sox would later play in the majors.\n\nOne player would make the hall of fame. The Country Music Hall of Fame, that is. A pitcher, singer and guitarist named Charley Pride.\n\nMemphis's current professional baseball team, the minor league Redbirds, will hold Memphis Red Sox Night at AutoZone Park on Aug. 10, 2024.

So playing in this game, it's going to be amazing.\"\n\nDuring the game, the Cardinals and Giants will wear the uniforms of two former Negro League Baseball teams with hometown ties: The St. Louis Stars and the San Francisco Sea Lions.\n\nThe Negro Leagues consisted of the Stars, Sea Lions, and many other teams across seven baseball leagues from the 1920s to the 1950s, in an era when racial segregation prevented African-American athletes from playing in Major League Baseball.\n\nSeveral decades later, just last month, Major League Baseball recently recognized the Negro Leagues as its own \"Major League\" and incorporated Negro Leagues statistics into MLB's all-time records.\n\nWinn is eager to keep learning about Black representation in baseball. Working closely with Cardinals legends Ozzie Smith and Willie McGee in spring training has helped him build more confidence and a stronger appreciation of how the game has evolved.\n\n\"Growing up, looking up to players like Ozzie Smith, Willie McGee and Willie Mays, it's going to be a true honor to be there,\" said Winn via a Cardinals social media post. \"The guys that have paved the way before us have made it easier for us. We're so thankful. It's truly a blessing to have Black players to look up to, and we want to follow their footsteps.\"\n\nSeveral tributes are planned for baseball legend Willie Mays on Thursday. A longtime Giants outfielder and MLB Hall-of-Famer, Mays earned his first professional baseball opportunities at Rickwood Field with the Negro Leagues' Birmingham Barons.\n\nWinn shared the Cardinals' Instagram story on Thursday that showed him smiling next to Willie Mays' Hall of Fame plaque.\n\nWinn will have the opportunity to share the special occasion with one other Black Cardinals player. St. Louis recalled Victor Scott ahead of the game to serve as an extra 27th man allowed for the matchup.\n\nWinn also shares a close bond with Jordan Walker, a Black outfielder currently in the Cardinals' minor league system.\n\n\"Jordan and I have talked about that a lot,\" said Winn via Denton's MLB.com report. \"Especially in the St. Louis community, where there's such a big Black population, we feel we can have a big impact. In the Black community, usually it's more about basketball and football, but we've got to get more African-American kids playing baseball. It would be super cool to be an inspiration to others.\"\n\n\"Being able to look up to so many people while I was growing up, I want to show these other Black kids that it's fun playing baseball.\"\n\nFirst pitch for the Rickwood Field Game is set for 6:15 p.m. FOX 2 will carry the game broadcast.", "source": {"uri": "fox2now.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox2Now"}, "authors":
